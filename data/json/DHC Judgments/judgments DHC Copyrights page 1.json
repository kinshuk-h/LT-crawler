                        "content": "Today, ld. Counsel for the Intervenor submits that the legal issue raised in the present case has been considered by other Courts. Reliance is placed upon the judgment of the ld. Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in CWP No.28758 of 2019 (O&M) titled Novex  Communications Private Limited v. Union of India & Anr., wherein the Court quashed the impugned public notice exempting the use of copyrights sound recordings for the purposes of marriage functions, and held that the question of fair use under Section 52(1)(za) has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. The relevant extracts from the said judgment are set out below:  •[14]. The question whether certain acts would fall within the exempted categories as enumerated under Section 52(1) of the Act has to be decided according to facts of each case. In view of aforesaid there cannot be general interpretation to the, provision as given in the  impugned public notice/letter. The theory of presumed intention or fair use and infringement, public, interest etc is to be judged on the material available in a given case. When the copyrights are exploited for the commercial purpose, the remedy lies under the Act itself i.e. both under civil as well criminal laws. [15]. The impugned public notice/letter dated 27.08.2019 can be misused by certain notorious elements in order to enrich themselves by playing the sound recordings for commercial gains in commercial spaces after obtaining requisite authorization from the authority. The element of commercial gain cannot be ruled out from the interpretation as given by respondent No.2 to Section 52 the Copyright Act, 1957. Respondent No.2 has no authority under the Act to clarify or interpret applicability of law in the manner as suggested in the impugned public notice/letter. The impugned public notice does not disclose the authority under which the same has been issued. The impugned public notice cannot override the provisions of Copyright Act and cannot take away the statutory right of the petitioner under Section 55 of the Act to initiate civil proceedings in the Court of law for the infringement of Copyright Act, 1957. The impugned interpretation would give rise to a very enormous situation and in such eventuality, the police authorities may refuse to take cognizance of the offence of infringement of copyright, which may be an offence under Section 63 of the Act punishable therein. The impugned public notice is in contravention of the ratio laid down in M/s Phonographic Performance Limited case (supra)  [16]. The impugned public notice is also violative of the doctrine of separation of power as an attempt has been made by respondent No.2 to usurp the legislative power of enactment and judicial power of interpretation. The impugned public notice also infringes the right of the petitioner under Article 19(1  )(g) of the Constitution of India and it overrules the provisions of copyright. The impugned public notice does not provide any such reasonable restrictions in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. Even otherwise, those restrictions ought to be imposed through process of law to be enacted by the Parliament or the State Legislature as the case may be. Such restrictions cannot be imposed by means of executive restrictions and public notice seeking to explain or interpret the provisions of law without sanction and leave of the legislative authorities. The public notice seeks to impinge upon the fundamental rights and protections granted by the Constitution of India and is violative of Articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution of India. The protections granted by the copyright Act are sought to be abridged by the public notice, which is unsustainable. [17]. The defences submitted by respondents No.1 and 2 in the context of relief are not in public interest and the public notice only explained the existing provisions in terms of Section 52(1 )(za) of the Copyright Act are totally fallacious for the reasons recorded hereinabove.  [18]. In view of above, the impugned public notice is quashed. This writ petition is allowed. Consequential action to follow.•",

The Indian copyright law has made use of the flexibilities available within the international copyright law framework, striking a fair balance between fostering incentives for creativity and ensuring adequate access to copyrighted works for the society through the various exceptions and limitations provided under the Act. S. 52(1)(za) of the Act is one such exception, which comes within the scope of •implied exceptions•/ •minor exceptions•/ •minor reservations• allowed under the international treaties on copyright law.1 As per the TRIPS Agreement, the member states are required to submit their laws to the TRIPS Council to ensure that the provisions are in compliance with the TRIPS Agreement. India has submitted her copyright laws and no objections have been raised by any of the Member States on S. 52(1)(za). This may also be viewed as an affirmation that the Member States of the WTO agree that this provision is in compliance with the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.",

The following specific aspects may be taken into consideration by the Court while adjudicating the scope of S. 52(1)(za). First, marriage is one of the most important social institutions in India and marriage ceremonies as well as the related festivities are given the highest importance by most communities in India. S. 52(1)(za) needs to be interpreted in a manner that protects and promotes the important constitutional right under Article 21 of the Constitution to perform marriage and engage in marriage related festivities in accordance with one•s own tradition and culture. Second, the existence of criminal remedies for copyright infringement, combined with the fact that copyright owners are not required to go through any formal examination system to claim copyright ownership over any subject matter, makes it important to limit the scope of rights of copyright owners in the context of official and religious ceremonies, and more specifically ceremonies and festivities associated with marriages. As copyright infringement is also now interpreted by the Supreme Court as a cognisable and non-bailable offence under S. 63 of the Act, a narrow reading of the provision may lead to potential harassment by police officers and copyright owners during one or more of the important ceremonies or festivities associated with marriage. Third, potential police intervention during marriage or any social festivities associated with marriage is also a potential threat to the right to privacy guaranteed under the Constitution.",

KYK Corporation Ltd. and Anr.] was rejected by a learned Single Judge of this Court as the Court found no infirmity with the findings of the IPAB that the appellants had failed to establish the use of the Trademark, as claimed in their application. Thus, the decision of IPAB to rectify the trademarks register and cancel the registration of the Trademark in favour of the appellants, was upheld. During the course of the said proceedings, the appellants had contended that KYK Corporation had failed to establish a trans-border reputation. Prima facie, the Court found the said contention to be unpersuasive but declined to examine the question in any detail. This was because the IPAB’s order, which was impugned in the said petition, rested on the finding that the appellants had failed to establish the facts on the basis of which the registration of the Trademark was granted in their favour. Thus, the IPAB’s order for rectification of the Trademark could not be faulted. The relevant extract from the judgment dated 03.11.2017 passed by the Court in W.P.(C)2496/2012 is reproduced below:  “20. The contention that KYK Corp has been unable to establish a trans-border reputation is also unpersuasive. KYK Corp had produced evidence to show that its  goods were being sold in India. It had also produced material to show that it was exporting goods to United States to show that it was using the mark in USA since 1953. However, it is not necessary to examine this issue as the conclusion of IPAB that the petitioners were unable to establish the use of the mark as claimed in their application, warranting a rectification of the registered trademark cannot be faulted.”",

He also did not find any precedential value in the case law cited by the appellant.  The appellant had cited decisions in India TV, Independent News Service Pvt. Ltd. v. India Broadcast Live LLC & Ors. reported as 2007 SCC OnLine Del 960 and Juggernaut Books Pvt. Ltd. v. Inkmango Inc. and Ors., CS(COMM) 421/2019, in support. The decision in India TV, Independent News Service Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) was distinguished by observing that there was an intent on the part of the channel to increase its subscriber base in India and the channel could actually be subscribed in India. As such, there was a conscious targeting of customers in India, which is missing in the present case. Similarly, the decision in Juggernaut Books Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) was distinguished on the same ground of customer targeting and connection with India in the content, which is found missing in the present case.",

In Banyan  Tree Holding (P) Limited v. A. Murali Krishna Reddy & Anr. reported as 2009  SCC OnLine Del 3780, while answering a reference, a Division Bench of this Court has laid down the following principles:  “58. We summarise our findings on the questions referred for our opinion as under:  Question (i): For the purposes of a passing off action, or an infringement action where the Plaintiff is not carrying on  business within the jurisdiction of a court, in what circumstances can it be said that the hosting of a universally accessible website by the Defendants lends jurisdiction to such Court where such suit is filed (“the forum court”)  Answer: For the purposes of a passing off action, or an infringement action where the plaintiff is not carrying on business within the jurisdiction of a court, and in the absence of a long-arm statute, in order to satisfy the forum court that it has jurisdiction to entertain the suit, the Plaintiff would have to show that the Defendant “purposefully availed” itself of the jurisdiction of the forum court. For this it would have to be prima facie shown that the nature of the activity indulged in by the Defendant by the use of the website was with an intention to conclude a commercial transaction with the website user and that the specific targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm to the plaintiff within the forum state.  Question (ii): In a passing off or infringement action, where the defendant is sought to be sued on the basis that its website is accessible in the forum state, what is the extent of the burden on the Plaintiff to prima facie establish that the forum court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit?  Answer: For the purposes of Section 20 (c) CPC, in order to show that some part of the cause of action has arisen in the forum state by the use of the internet by the Defendant the Plaintiff will have to show prima facie that the said website, whether euphemistically termed as “passive plus” or “interactive” was specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions. The Plaintiff would have to plead this and produce material to prima facie show that some commercial transaction using the website was entered into by the Defendant with a user of its website within the forum state resulting in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state.  Question (iii): Is it permissible for the Plaintiff to establish such prima facie case through “trap orders” or “trap transactions”?  Answer: The commercial transaction entered into by the Defendant with an internet user located within the jurisdiction of the forum court cannot possibly be a solitary trap transaction since that would not be an instance of “purposeful” availment by the Defendant. It would have to be a real commercial transaction that the Defendant has with someone not set up by the Plaintiff itself. If the only evidence is in the form of a series of trap transactions, they have to be shown as having been obtained using fair means. The Plaintiff seeking to establish jurisdiction on the basis of such trap transactions would have to aver unambiguously in the plaint, and also place along with it supporting material, to prima facie show that the trap transactions relied upon satisfy the above test.”  (emphasis added)",

Following are the useful paragraphs from the said judgment:  “67. In considering those contentions, it is convenient to start near the end of the consumer's journey while keeping firmly in mind the context provided by the preceding stages. I shall take by way of example the “Review your order” page described in paragraphs 20-21 above. There is no dispute that this is an offer (for sale) of the goods within Article 9(3)(b) of the Regulation (whether it would be categorised as an invitation to treat under English contract law is irrelevant for this purpose). If one asks whether that offer was targeted at the UK, in my view it is manifest that the answer is yes. The purchaser is located in the UK, the shipping address is in the UK, the billing address is in the UK, the currency of payment is GBP and Amazon will make all the necessary arrangements for the goods to be shipped to and imported into the UK and delivered to the consumer in the UK. I do not understand how it can seriously be argued that this offer for sale was not targeted at the UK, notwithstanding the valiant attempt of counsel for Amazon to do just that.  xxx",

                        "content": "Secondly, the judge accepted Amazon's argument that, because amazon.com was directed at US consumers, the relevant web pages were not targeted at UK/EU consumers. This does not follow:  i)  Even if amazon.com is primarily directed at US consumers, it is plainly not restricted to them. Although the UK user is informed by the amazon.com home page that they can shop at amazon.co.uk and get fast local delivery, it would be easy for the user to miss this statement. Even if they saw it, it is simply offering an alternative to amazon.com. The home page also tells the user that they can shop in eight languages and more than 60 currencies, and more specifically that they can get delivery to the UK. Furthermore, once the user has conducted a search, the message about amazon.co.uk no longer appears.  ii)  In any event, the question is not whether amazon.com as a whole is targeted at the UK/EU, but whether the relevant uses of the sign are. As discussed above, the fact that the generality of a website is not targeted at the UK/EU does not exclude the possibility that specific uses of the sign on that website are.",

There was, however, no evidential basis for assuming that such a decision had been made at the initial stage of the process, and for reasons that I have explained, those factors in fact show that, at the “Review your order” stage, Amazon were offering US branded goods for sale to consumers in the UK and the EU.",

I disagree. Consumers would not necessarily be aware of these differences unless they made the comparison; and even if they were, the differences might have been offset by the assumed price differentials. I say “might have been offset by the assumed price differentials” because there does not appear to have been any evidence as to the actual price differentials. Still less was there any evidence as to the net difference in cost. In any event, while this might be a relevant factor, it is not a very significant one if the  evidence shows, as in the present case it does, that some consumers were not put off by such higher costs.",

It is fair to say that the price and shipping cost are both quoted in USD.

Mere looming presence of a website in a geography and ability of the customers therein to access the website is sufficient, in a given case.

It was noticed by the learned Single Judge that there is a fifty-hit-a-day traffic on the respondents’ website, which he found to be inadequate for assuming jurisdiction. However, there is other material produced with the plaint namely respondent’s No.1 ‘White Paper’ and printouts of its social media pages, which show respondents’ looming presence in the virtual world over India, including in the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. The fact that the people behind the offending website are stated to be UK nationals of  Pakistani origin does make the motives suspicious, given the popularity of TATA brand among the people from Indian sub-continent. It is not unreasonable to infer that the objective of respondent No.1 could be to target unsuspecting Indian origin public by doing trade in the name of “TATA”. It does not take much in the virtual world to masquerade as somebody else, unlike physical world, where it would have cost respondent No.1 a huge expense to dress up its business to the quality of a physical TATA store.
