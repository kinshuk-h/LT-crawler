The registration of copyright in respect of artistic works is, thus, founded on the basis of the NOC issued by the Trademark Office. Recently, this Court in C.O.(COMM.IPD-CR) 1/2021 titled Abhishek Kumar v. Union of India Through Registrar of Copyrights in order dated 30th August, 2022 has summed up the legal position under section 45 of the Act and held as under:  “15. Considering now the fact that the search certificate has been cancelled and the Petitioner’s first application for the trademark has also been revived, the copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3 can no longer stand. Obtaining an NOC under the proviso to Section 45 of the Act is compulsory in order to obtain registration of copyright. Clearly, there seems to be some misconduct indulged into by Respondent No.3 which has resulted in this entire sequence of events leading up to the grant of copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3. The NOC having been cancelled, the first trademark application of the Petitioner having been revived and no reply having been filed by Respondent No.3 to contest the present petition as also the mark of the Petitioner and the artistic work of Respondent No.3 being identical, the copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3 would be an entry which is wrongly made and wrongly remaining on the register in terms of Section 50 of the Act…”",

                        "content": "In the present case, clearly, a perusal of the copyright registrations and the packaging used by both the parties itself shows that the labels are almost identical in nature. The Court has also seen the physical packagings which have been handed over to the Court and there is no doubt whatsoever that the Respondent No.3’s packaging/label is a substantial imitation of the Petitioner’ packaging. The Petitioner’s registration of copyright is dated 27th February, 2018 and the Respondent No.3’s NOC was issued on 18th June, 2019. Further, the copyright registration of Respondent No.3 dated 21 October, 2019 is subsequent to that of the Petitioner’s copyright registration. In the opinion of the Court, the two competing registrations, which are almost identical to each other, cannot be sustained under the Copyright Act. Respondent No.3’s artistic work is a substantial and colourable imitation of  the Petitioner’s artistic work. In any event, the Registrar of the Trademarks, has vide its order dated 23rd March, 2021 has given the following findings:  “  On 27/11/2017 the above named Applicant through their Attorney M/s. Tyagi Vertifications, Delhi filed an application for search and certificate under Section 45(1) of the Copyright Act, 1957 vide C.C.No.87288 seeking NOC in relation to artistic label ASLI KESARI CHAI with device of \"woman plucking tea leaves”. The office conducted a search and issued a Search Report (NOC) for the artistic label applied under TM-C on 18/06/2019.  The Objector vide their letter dated 27/12/2019 filed a cancellation request under Rule 22(2) of the Trade Marks Rules, 2017 objecting to the NOC issued under Copyright Certificate No.87288. The said objection was forwarded to the Applicant for comments. The Applicant has not given any comments to the said objection letter. Thereafter the matter was fixed for hearing on 16/03/2021 when Mr. Rajat Agarwal, Advocate appeared for the objector and none appeared for the Applicant.  The Advocate for the Objector explained the facts. The Objector has filed copy of registration certificate in trademark no.3035105 in Class 30 and copyright registration certificate vide registration no.A-124161/2018 dated 27/02/2018. The objectors’ contention is that the impugned NOC under C.C. No.827288 for the label ASLI KESARI CHAI has been obtained fraudulently by the Applicant. The Applicant's impugned label ASLI KESARI CHAI with device of woman plucking tea leaves, the colour scheme and get up of the packaging is identical and similar to the Objectors’ copyright registration for artistic label HIGHGRON KESARI CHAI.  I carefully compared the NOC issued to the Applicant and rival artistic label of the objector. In both the artistic labels the colour of the packaging is identical, the device of woman plucking leaves is also identical, the manner of presentation of the word ASLI KESARI CHAI and HIGHGRON is deceptively similar. Both the labels compared as a whole shows mere re-production of the objector's HIGHGRON label by the Applicant for the artistic label KESARI CHAI.  In view of the similarity and intentionally adopting the artistic label of the objectors' to gain benefit of the copyright, the NOC issued in C.C.No.87288 is liable to be cancelled.  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that objection filed by the Objector is hereby allowed and search certificate issued under TMR-NOC-C.C.No.87288 dated 18/06/2019 is hereby cancelled as per Rule 22(2) of Trade Marks Rules, 2017.  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that there shall be no order as to costs.”",

The respondent also claims that it has spent a substantial amount of money in advertising its products and thus, its trademarks enjoy “solid and enduring reputation” and have thus, acquired the status of a ‘well known trademark’.",

The cited judgments relied upon by counsel for defendant, however, distinguishable from the facts of the present case in hand as word ‘Century’ is not common to the trade and he has failed to establish on record that it is common to trade in respect of kitchenware, therefore user of the same with ‘Sepal’ does not infringe trade mark of the plaintiff in any manner. The mark of the plaintiff is read with ‘Century’ word and it cannot be segregated. It is well settled law that trade mark as a whole can be seen and judgment relied on by plaintiff in case of Ireo Pvt. Ltd. (supra) is applicable to the facts of case. Defendant has also failed to show as to how he had coined word ‘century’ with ‘sepal’ which plaintiff has been using and therefore adoption of word is dishonest as plaintiff is prior user and registered proprietor of the same. Although it is true that plaintiff has no exclusive right over the  word ‘century’ as same is English word having specific meaning yet as against the plaintiff, the defendant cannot use the same in the absence of evidence on record that ‘century’ word has acquired generic meaning in respect of trade in question.",

An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial courts discretion.”",

In circumstances virtually  identical to the present case, the Court came to the conclusion that the concerned websites were guilty of copyright infringement under Section 51 of the Act and were not entitled to exemptions under 52 (1)(c) of the Act or Section 79 of Information Technology Act, 2000. As far as “rogue websites” are concerned, the Court identified the following illustrative factors to be considered in determining whether a particular website falls within that class:  “59. In the opinion of this Court, some of the factors to be considered for determining whether the website complained of is a FIOL/Rogue Website are:–  a.  whether the primary purpose of the website is to commit or facilitate copyright infringement;  b.  the flagrancy of the infringement, or the flagrancy of the facilitation of the infringement;  c.  Whether the detail of the registrant is masked and no personal or traceable detail is available either of the Registrant or of the user.  d.  Whether there is silence or inaction by such website after receipt of take down notices pertaining to copyright infringement.  e.  Whether the online location makes available or contains directories, indexes or categories of the means to infringe, or facilitate an infringement of, copyright;  f.  Whether the owner or operator of the online location demonstrates a disregard for copyright generally;  g.  Whether access to the online location has been disabled by orders from any court of another country or territory on the ground of or related to copyright infringement;  h.  whether the website contains guides or instructions to circumvent measures, or any order of any court, that disables access to  the website on the ground of or related to copyright  infringement; and  i.  the volume of traffic at or frequency of access to the website;  j.

Clearly, there seems to be some misconduct indulged into by Respondent No.3 which has resulted in this entire sequence of events leading up to the grant of copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3. The NOC having been cancelled, the first trademark application of the Petitioner having been revived and no reply having been filed by Respondent No.3 to contest the present petition as also the mark of the Petitioner and the artistic work of Respondent No.3 being identical, the copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3 would be an entry which is wrongly made and wrongly remaining on the register in terms of Section 50 of the Act.

The impugned mark is confusingly and deceptively similar to the Plaintiff’s trademark and is being used by the Defendant to sell look-alike/identical products, targeting the same class of consumers. The modus operandi of the Defendant is to confuse the customers into buying the infringing products by using actual photographs and product description of EINSTEIN BOX products. As an illustration, Plaintiff uses a custom-made black tray for its ‘Ultimate Science Kit’, while the Defendant uses images of Plaintiff’s tray on Defendant No.1’s website under product information to misrepresent the contents of its impugned ‘Ultimate Science Kit’ which does not provide a black tray. This also leads to tarnishing the reputation of the Plaintiff and blurring its registered trademark. EINSTEIN BOX is based on the name of the world renowned and widely known Physicist Albert Einstein while Newton Box is based on the globally known  Scientist Sir Isaac Newton and therefore, there is a semantic similarity between the two trademarks. It cannot be disputed that both Einstein and Newton were not ordinary persons but were peerless geniuses.

                        "content": "In Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Division Bench of this Court extensively examined the interplay between the settled position  with respect to deceptive similarity, English language, branding and related literature on human psychology and associated thinking, while considering deceptive similarity between trademarks ‘Officer’s Choice’ and ‘Collector’s Choice’ and held that the words ‘Collector’ and ‘Officer’ are both synonyms of a ‘Person holding an Office of Authority’ and hence, when both would be regularly presented in relation to a ‘Person holding an Office of Authority’, a habit would form where thinking of ‘Officer’ shall bring to mind the word ‘Collector’. It was observed by the Court that when a consumer while making an informed decision to purchase, is confronted with the product of the Appellant with the mark ‘Collector’s Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ shall bring to his mind the cue ‘person holding an office of authority’, which is related to the word ‘Officer’, since both are used in the context of whisky. This cue may guide the consumer in confusing the Appellant’s whisky with that of the Respondent or may generate a false memory that will lead to confusion. It was thus held that the two words are deceptively similar. On the same analogy, if ‘Einstein Box’ and ‘Newton Box’ would be regularly presented in relation of ‘learning kits for children’, a habit would form where thinking of the former would bring to the mind of the customers, the latter. Use of the impugned mark, which is deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s registered mark, by the Defendant amounts to infringement under Section 29(2) of the Act.",

The product listing images were also changed to new and distinguishable set of images and these facts were in the knowledge of the Plaintiff. Despite this, Plaintiff obtained an ex parte injunction order by misleading the Court and concealing the actual facts.

This is not a concept which should be examined bereft of the context else, Coca-Cola (the company which was the pioneer of fizzy soft-drinks) would not have co-existed with other fizzy soft drink manufacturing companies in the market, such as, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, RC Cola etc. and similar logic would have applied to cab-booking applications like Uber, Ola, Meru etc., which are all based on the same concept. Hence, Plaintiff’s contention of ‘conceptual similarity’ has no substance and is misplaced.",

It is equally well settled that where a charge of copyright infringement is levelled against the Defendant, the test is to see whether the Defendant has copied the idea as also adopted the work substantially which on a prima facie look shows that it is an imitation. The principles elucidated to resolve the idea-expression dichotomy, as culled out by a Three-Judges Bench of the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra), are as follows:- “45. Thus, the position appears to be that an idea, principle, theme, or subject-matter or historical or legendary facts being common property cannot be the subject-matter of copyright of a particular person. It is always open to any person to choose an idea as a subject-matter and develop it in his own manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently from others. Where two writers write on the same subject similarities are bound to occur because the central idea of both are the same but the similarities or coincidences by themselves cannot lead to an irresistible inference of plagiarism or piracy. Take for instance the great poet and dramatist Shakespeare most of whose plays are based on Greek-Roman and British mythology or legendary stories like Merchant of Venice, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Ceasar etc. But the treatment of the subject by Shakespeare in each of his dramas is so fresh, so different, so full of poetic exuberance elegance and erudition and so novel in character as a result of which the end product becomes an original in itself. In fact, the power and passion of his expression, the uniqueness, eloquence and excellence of his style and pathos and bathos of the dramas become peculiar to Shakespeare and leaves precious little of the  original theme adopted by him. It will thus be preposterous to level a charge of plagiarism against the great playwright. In fact, throughout his original thinking, ability and incessant labour Shakespeare has converted an old idea into a new one, so that each of his dramas constitute a masterpiece of English literature. It has been rightly said that “every drama of Shakespeare is an extended metaphor”. Thus, the fundamental fact which has to be determined where a charge of violation of the copyright is made by the plaintiff against the defendant is to determine whether or not the defendant not only adopted the idea of the copyrighted work but has also adopted the manner, arrangement, situation to situation, scene to scene with minor changes or super additions or embellishment here and there. Indeed, if on a perusal of the copyrighted work the defendant's work appears to be a transparent rephrasing or a copy of a substantial and material part of the original, the charge of plagiarism must stand proved. Care however must be taken to see whether the defendant has merely disguised piracy or has actually reproduced the original in different form, different tone, different tenor so as to infuse a new life into the idea of the copyrighted work adapted by him. In the latter case there is no violation of the copyright.",

The themes in those books could be the same, but the presentation, treatment and the expression of the same theme would be different and cannot be identical. We have examined the original books and compared them with the books against which allegation of infringement is made in order to find out whether there was any intention to copy the original, and particularly the portions thereof which are shown to be reproduction by the appellant from their books. Some of the passages from the books published by both the parties, where similarity in the passages is apparent, find mention below:  ……  The afore-extracted comparisons are only specimens of the voluminous similar data placed on record by the appellant in the form of Annexures-G, D, E and F. The said comparisons would clearly establish that there are similarities in the expressions used. There are also a number of similarities in the introduction chapter wherein almost identical expression of the idea is used from the books of the appellant. The authors, who have written the books on behalf of the respondent No. 1, appears to have not only taken the facts and materials from the books of the appellant, but also the treatment and the expression appear to be the same at material places, both in the form and in the manner of expression of the idea. There are voluminous materials extracted from the various parts of the books and from different chapters thereof which are verbatim or near verbatim reproduction from the books of the appellant. Despite the fact that the aforesaid reproduced materials have been brought to our notice which are found to be similar and identical with those of the books of the appellant, which are used by the respondent in their books, the learned Single Judge held that as the books are on scientific and technical subject, therefore, there would be definitely discussion only on the common aspects and common engineering aspects and, therefore, it cannot be said that the defendants/respondents have infringed the copyright of the plaintiff/ appellant. The said deduction, in our considered opinion, cannot be held to be justified and we find the same to be erroneous.",

Most of the materials placed before us would indicate that in many theories and expressions used in the various chapters of the book, one or two sentences from the original books are dropped whereas the rest are used and reproduced in the same manner and with similar expression as that of the original books. Once the said materials are compared, it would be established that what is used by the respondents in their books is substantial and material reproduction of the work of the appellant. Being a scientific and technical book, theme could be said to be the same but unfortunately in the present case, the same is not presented differently from the books of the appellant and it appears to be verbatim reproduction in many passages, as is evident from the materials which are available on record. The same indicates the intention to copy the original. It, therefore, cannot be said that the work of the respondent is completely new or primary. The respondents have not been able to show any broad material dissimilarities in the passages and in the materials which are part of the records.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Argument of the Defendant is essentially predicated on there being no originality in the works of the Plaintiff in which copyrights are asserted. This Court does not agree with this contention of the Defendant for two-fold reasons. Firstly, Plaintiff has categorically stated that Defendant has itself applied for copyright registration for the impugned works and cannot approbate and reprobate, which position is not disputed by the Defendant and is rather admitted.  Secondly, legally speaking, copyright is not concerned with originality or novelty of ideas but with the expression of thought in a concrete form, as held in R.G. Anand (supra). It was held that though ideas, themes, historical or legendary facts being common property cannot be subject matter of copyright of a particular person, however, it is always open to any person to choose an idea as a subject matter and develop it in his own manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently.",

Anand (supra), in my prima facie view, the stand of the Plaintiff is correct that the components of the Einstein Boxes i.e. learning kits, which include books, activities, games and experiments, online marketing material, instruction manuals etc., do constitute original literary and artistic work as the Plaintiff, has by its skill and creativity, expended a different expression, character and quality to the work and is the author of the said work. The rhymes/alphabets/numbers/ science experiments may not be original, but the style of lettering, addition and placement of graphics, pictures, colours etc. are unique and distinct to the Plaintiff and it has by its different expression and aesthetic sense converted old ideas into new ones, entitling it to protection under the Copyright Act, 1957. In this context, I may allude to a judgment of this Court in Mohanlal Gupta v. Board of School Education, Haryana and Others, 1976 SCC Online Del 101, relevant paras of which are as under:- “2. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, defines ‘literary’ as ‘1. Pertaining to the letters of the alphabet, 2. Carried on by letter: epistolary, 3. Of or pertaining to, or of the nature of, literature, polite learning, or books and written compositions; pertaining to that kind of written composition which has value on account of its qualities of form, 4. Versed in literature; spec. engaged in literature as a profession. Of a society, etc.; Consisting of literary men.’ In Webster's Third New International Dictionary ‘literary’ is stated to mean-(i) literal, (ii) of, relating to, or having the characteristics of humane learning, (iii) of, relating to, or having the characteristics of literature, (iv) bookish, (v) of or relating to books, (vi) having a firsthand knowledge of literature, (vii) of, relating to, or concerning with men of letters or with writing as a profession.",

                        "content": "It was observed in University of London Press Ltd. v. University Tutorial Press Limited, 1961 (2) Ch. 601, that the words ‘literary work’ cover work which is expressed in print  or writing, irrespective of the question whether the quality or style is high. According to their Lordships the word ‘literary’ seems to be used, in a sense somewhat similar to the use of word ‘literature’ in political or electioneering literature and refers to written or printed matter. In this case examination papers were treated as constituting literary work. The same view of the matter was taken in Jagdish Prasad Gupta v. Parmeshwar Prasad Singh, (AIR 1966 Pat. 33) and Agarwala Publishing House Khurja v. Board of High School and Intermediate Education U.P. Allahabad, (AIR 1967 Allahabad 91). Copinger and Skone James commented in their work on ‘Copyright’ (Eleventh Edition, page 71) ‘so long as there is a sufficient amount of skill and labour in constructing or selecting the material, no particular skill in the literary form is needed’ and it was noted that ‘copyright has been conferred in respect of newspaper telegrams, in the rules of a game, in the rules and coupon for a football competition and in tallies for bridge parties’. W. Broome, J., observed in the case of Agarwala Publishing House (supra) that the words ‘literary works’ in Section 13 are not confined to works of literature in the commonly understood sense but include all works expressed in writing whether they have any literary merit or not. In Mishra Bandhu Karyalaya v. Shivratanlal Koshal (AIR 1970 M.P. 261), a book of arithmetic was treated as literary work. The definition of ‘literary work’ provided by the Act embracing tables and compilations is comprehensive enough to cover without a shadow of doubt books like the one in dispute. There is no substance in the defendants' contention, therefore, that the plaintiff's book on household accounts and domestic arithmetic was not a literary work and the plaintiff could not claim to have a copyright therein.",

According to their Lordship of the Privy Council (Sec Macmillan and Company  Limited v. K. and J. Cooper, AIR 1924 P.C. 75) “any new and original plan, arrangement or compilation of material will entitle the author to copyright therein, whether the materials themselves be old or new” and “whosoever by his own skill, labour and judgment writes a new work may have a copyright therein unless it be directly copied or evasively imitated from another's work'.

As laid down in Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Stonesifer,  140  F. 2d 579, the two works have to be tested not hypercritically or with meticulous scrutiny, but by observations and impressions of an average reasonable reader and spectator. In K.R. Venugopala Sarma v. Sangu Ganesan, 1971 SCC OnLine Mad 342, it was held albeit in case of a film that degree of resemblance, which is to be judged by the eye, must be such that the person looking at one’s work gets the suggestion that it is of the other, i.e. it is a substantial copy.",

In my view, none of these components or their content(s), except those mentioned above in para 70 of this judgment, can be termed as infringing the copyright of the Plaintiff. No reader or viewer, while comparing these components in the competing products, would get an impression that there is any substantial copy or reproduction of the Plaintiff’s work by the Defendant, leave alone an imitation of a threshold to hold Defendant prima facie guilty of copyright infringement. No doubt that there is commonality in the use of numbers/ alphabets, on which in any case, no copyright can be claimed, but it is also manifest that the source being common, similarities are bound to occur. The manner, in which the Defendant has expressed the idea by use of its own skill or creativity, has resulted in a new work which cannot be said to be a literal imitation of the Plaintiff’s work. In fact, similarities are insignificant while dissimilarities outweigh the trivial similarities. As held by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra), in such a case, the Courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. In Dorsey v. Old Surety Life Ins. Co., 98 F. 2d 872, Phillips, J. observed that the right secured by a copyright is not the right to use of certain words, nor the right to employ ideas expressed thereby. Rather it is the right to that arrangement of words which the author has selected to express his ideas, and to constitute infringement in such cases a showing of appropriation in the exact form or substantially so, of the copyrighted material is required.",

Learned Senior counsel for the Defendant had contended that the injunction order is required to be vacated qua the product ‘Ultimate Science Kit’ since the two are completely different inasmuch as both have different product listings and packaging. Both products differ in the background colour, images on the packaging, number of experiments and more importantly, the words ‘Little Olive’ are clearly evident on the box and are enough to distinguish the kit of the Defendant from that of the Plaintiff. Having perused the two competing products, I am prima facie in agreement with the Defendant that there cannot be any confusion as the two are significantly different and Defendant cannot be said to have adopted the trade dress of the Plaintiff. A mere visual comparison brings forth the differences in colour scheme, layout and more importantly, one bears the name Einstein Box while the other has Little Olive prominently shown in the left corner and no customer can be confused. There is no gainsaying that if anyone sells a science kit with experiments in chemistry, perhaps the only way to depict would by showing images of test tubes, beakers, flasks, tripod stand etc. This alone cannot be a ground to contend that there was an intent to pass off the goods. In the present case, it is also apparent that the Defendant has used a different equipment, i.e. tripod stand, burner and a flask with a test tube stand in which the tubes are differently placed and there is no merit in the contention that the Defendant is passing off its product for that of the Plaintiff.

In fact, Defendant also filed an application under Section 340 Cr.P.C. alleging perjury. In response to the application, Plaintiff has taken a categorical stand that the image produced by the Defendant in the said application was another stock keeping unit of the Plaintiff’s product and that it still continues to produce the product with the trade dress as mentioned in the plaint.

As against this, in an opposition to the registration of a trade mark, the onus to prove deceptive similarity is on the defendant who seeks non-registration, or removal of the trade mark from the register.  (c)  “Confusion” refers to the state of mind of the customer who, on seeing the mark, thinks that it differs from the mark on the goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due imperfect recollection. The question is one of first impression.  (d)  This is especially true in the matter of phonetic similarity. A meticulous comparison of the words, syllable by syllable, is to be avoided. The possibility of careless pronunciation and speech, both on the part of the buyer walking into the shop, as well as the shop assistant, is also required to be factored into consideration.  (e)  The matter has to be examined from the point of view of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. It has to be seen as to how such a purchaser would react to the trade mark, the association which he would form and how he would  connect the trade marks with the goods he would be purchasing.  (f)  The Pianotisi test, postulated over a century ago, has repeatedly been endorsed by the Supreme Court, as the definitive test to be adopted while comparing rival trade marks. According to this test, the Court is required to judge the rival trade marks by their look and sound, and consider  (i)  the goods to which they are to be applied,  (ii)  the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods,  (iii)  all surrounding circumstances and  (iv)  the consequences which would follow if each of the marks is used in the normal way as the trade mark for the goods of the respective owners.  While doing so, the common part of the words forming the competing marks may not be decisive. The overall similarity of the composite words is required to be seen, having regard to the circumstance (if applicable) that both are on like goods of similar description. The test to be applied is whether, if the two marks are used in a normal and fair manner, there is likelihood of confusion or deception.  (g)  The whole word/mark is to be considered. An ordinary man would not split a word or name, in a trade mark, into its components, but would go by the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the marks at the nature of the goods previously purchased, or of which he has been told and which he wants to purchase. It has to be examined whether the totality of the trade mark of the defendant is likely to cause deception/confusion or mistake in the minds of the persons accustomed to the existing trade mark of the plaintiff.  (h)  The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The Court is, however, required to apply both the phonetic and the visual tests. At times, ocular similarity may be sufficient to find possibility of confusion/deception, even if the marks are visually dissimilar, though ocular similarity, by itself, may not, generally, be the decisive test. Where, however, (i) in all other respects, the  marks of the plaintiff and defendant are different, (ii) the word/words, in the marks, which are phonetically similar, cannot be regarded as the dominant word, or essential feature, in the marks, and (iii) the surrounding circumstances also belie any possibility of confusion, it has been held that deceptive similarity cannot be found to exist merely on the basis of phonetic similarity or even identity. The matter, apparently, is always one of fact. The Court would have to decide, on a comparison of the two marks, and the parts thereof which are phonetically similar, as to whether such phonetic similarity is likely, considering all other circumstances, to confuse or deceive a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, always bearing in mind the nature of the goods, and the degree of circumspection which would be expected of the purchasers who would purchase such goods.  (i)  The Court is required to examine whether the essential features of the plaintiff's mark are to be found in the mark of the defendant. Identification of the essential features is a question of fact, left to the discretion of the Court.  (j)  No objective standards are possible, regarding the degree of similarity which is likely to cause deception. It has to be seen from the viewpoint of the purchasers of the goods.  (k)  The test to be applied would depend on the facts of the case. Precedents are valuable only to the extent they specify tests for application, and not on facts.  (l)  On the issue of deceptive similarity, and especially with respect to the aspect of phonetic similarity, English cases are not of relevance. English cases are useful only to the extent they aid in understanding the essential features of trade mark law. The tests for deceptive similarity, which apply in other jurisdictions, may not always apply in India.  ….”",

(supra). The Division Bench of this Court, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. (supra) and the “The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition by Harold G. Fox”, etc. held that marks containing words with the same sense relation or falling in the same semantic field or conveying the same or similar idea in the mind as that of previously existing marks are likely to be considered so similar as to be refused registration or deemed to constitute infringement of the previously existing trademark. As an illustration, the Division Bench took an example of five brands of ‘Orange Juice’ named after ‘Caribbean Islands’ and held as under:- “34. In the aforementioned two examples one observes that the similarity in idea conveyed by the word marks, through hyponymy or synonymy, can only be said to occur when the hyponymy or synonymy exists in a given context. Thus, when brands of orange juice are named after various islands of the Caribbean they convey a similar idea, which is likely to be only in the context of enjoying a glass of orange juice on a beach at one such tropical island. Similarly, when Men's perfumes are named after synonyms of the word Tough, the commonness of idea is created only when the words are synonymous in the context of masculinity, and not when any word which is synonymous to Tough, in a different context (such as dangerous, or risky) is used.”",

So, when a consumer has to make a decision regarding a purchase, and is confronted with the product of the appellant with the mark ‘Collector's Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ shall bring to his mind the cue ‘Person holding an office of authority’ which is related to the word ‘Officer’ since both trademarks in the present case are used in the same context for whisky.

M/s Electronic Sound Components Co., 1994 (28) DRJ 459 and Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449. In my prima facie opinion, none of these judgments inure to the advantage of the Plaintiff in the facts of the present case. The words ‘Collector’ and ‘Officer’ are no doubt hyponyms of the phrase “Person holding an office of authority” and as held by the Division Bench, when a consumer makes a decision regarding purchase of whisky and is confronted with the product marked ‘Collector’s Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ brings to his mind the cue of a person in authority and this cue may guide him to the product of the respondent who is selling whisky under the mark ‘Officer’s Choice’. In the present case, the argument on behalf of the Plaintiff, overlooks the fact that in this very judgment, the Court noted a word of caution that it is important to create a parameter within which marks conveying similar ideas should be accorded protection because if protection  is accorded to the sense relation of a word, it raises a slippery slope as to what extent such monopoly can be extended under the trademark law. It was held that a restrictive application needs to be made and protection should be granted to those sense relations of the words where the context, in which they are applied to the brand name, is the same and distinguished cases where an orange juice was named after any other island which is not in the Caribbean and posed a question whether trademark protection of synonyms would extend to all synonyms such that men’s perfumes cannot be named after any word synonymous to the word ‘Tough’.",

Elbert Einstein was a German born, Theoretical Physicist, best known for developing the theory of Relativity. Both the geniuses had their own respective contributions and it can hardly be even suggested that anyone would confuse one with the other. Moreover, the products in question in the  present case are learning kits etc. for children between 01 to 06 years of age and are both available only online. Insofar as the children are concerned, as averred by the Plaintiff itself, they would only be attracted or guided by the external layout, colour schemes, images, pictorial representations, etc. and not by the names Newton Box or Einstein Box. Considering the age of the children for whose consumption the products are being sold, in all probability, the parents or other older people would be making the informed decisions to purchase the products and to any such person with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, no cue would confuse the word Einstein with Newton.",

If the contention of the Plaintiff is to be accepted that once it has used the name ‘Einstein’ as part of its trademark, no other person or entity can use the name of any other scientist for similar or identical products, it would amount to holding that Plaintiff has acquired a right to seek injunction not only against use of ‘Newton’ but any other name of a mathematician, physicist, scientist etc. This would give an exclusivity or monopoly to the Plaintiff over names of all scientists in the public domain and public juris, which cannot be countenanced and, therefore, it cannot be held that the competing marks are deceptively similar or there is infringement of the Plaintiff’s registered trademark.

Chidambarasamy, 2017 SCC OnLine Mad 37798, wherein the Plaintiff, a proprietor of the rice mill had a registered trademark ‘VALLUVAR’ in class 30 for rice. It was contended  that the Defendant by using a similar brand name ‘THIRUVALLUVAR’ for the same product was infringing the Plaintiff’s trademark as the trademark was identical. Defendant had contended that ‘THIRUVALLUVAR’ is a common name and in the public domain and no restraint order can be passed against the Defendant. The Madras High Court after examining the matter held as under:- “16. In the present case, the name “VALLUVAR” is associated only with the Saint Poet of Tamil and is revered by the Tamil Diaspora in that capacity. Hence, the name of the Saint Poet is part of the Tamil culture and is common to all members of the Tamil Diaspora. Therefore, no one can claim monopoly or exclusivity over the name “VALLUVAR” or “THIRUVALLUVAR”. In the case of passing off, the appellant may escape liability if he can show that added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the respondent. The given action is not an action for infringement but only merits the consideration as in a passing off action.

The said process of •latching on•, as illustratively placed on record by the Plaintiff, is set out below. To demonstrate this process, the Plaintiff admits to have used the account of a relative, Balagopala, on the Flipkart platform.  A perusal of the above slides shows that whenever a seller wishes to place some listings in a specific product category, a recommendation on the basis of the business conducted on its portal is given as to which are the •Best Seller• products. The caption •Grow your business by 3x• along with specific data, is also projected in order to entice the new seller to •latch on• to popular product listings. The said seller is then permitted to ADD the LISTING to his listing page. While giving this recommendation, the mark •V Tradition•, as also, the product photographs of the Plaintiff is permitted to be added by the third-party seller, without the permission or consent of the Plaintiff. It is, thus, clear that product listings of the Plaintiff are being  permitted to be used along with the Plaintiff•s brand name and image/s of the product created by the Plaintiff. The said brand name and photograph then becomes a part of the product listings of the third-party unauthorised seller who can then make similar looking products and sell them as though they originate from •V Tradition•.",

It amounts to taking unfair advantage of the goodwill that resides in the Plaintiff•s mark and business. In the context of e-commerce, this Court has no doubt that •latching on• by unauthorised sellers results in and constitutes •passing off• as known in the brick and mortar world.

Consent and authorisation of the brand owner and the listing owner would be required before such conduct by any seller is  permitted. In the present case, a perusal of the physical products handed over to the Court after purchases having been made from identical third-party sellers, shows that while the products of the Plaintiff have the label •V Tradition•, none of the others have any product tag name. The product design, look and feel, as also, the documents which have been placed on record by the Plaintiff, clearly show that the Flipkart platform has allowed third-party sellers to •latch on• to the Plaintiff•s product listings which were featuring as •Best Sellers•, by way of the •Opportunities• option.

                        "content": "Mr. Amit Sibal, Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs, advanced the following submissions:  A.  Novelty of Plaintiffs’ Registered Design: Unlike traditional hip flasks which are broad and short, the Hipster is modelled on the shape and proportions of a smartphone. Its essential features reside in its: (a) tall, lean and sleek look, (b) rectangular shape inspired from the shape and proportion of a smartphone; (c) smooth rounded shoulders and symmetrical edges; (d) protruding V-shaped neck situated at the middle of both shoulders; (e) symmetrically raised and plateau-like front and rear walls; (f)two-toned rimmed and rounded cap; and (g) dimpled bottom. The said essential features form the ‘shape and configuration’ of its distinctive design, compositely creating a visual impression that is ‘appealing to the eye’. No third-party has ever adopted a 180 ml bottle/packaging of a similar ‘shape and configuration’ with such novel design and strikingly distinctive visual impression that ‘appeals to the eye’, as that of Plaintiffs’ Registered Design. Further, the definition of ‘hipster’ has no relation to a hip flask or the anatomical part ‘hip’, but is completely arbitrary when used with respect to bottles, and means “one that follows trends that are out of the ordinary”.  B.  Marketing expenses: Considerable amount has been spent to promote the Hipster through advertising and social media marketing.  C.  Profits and goodwill: The Hipster has proved to be a runaway success, with almost 95000 cases (of 48 bottles each) worth Rs. 100 crores sold in just 1.5 years in India. As evident from its sales turnovers, media and social media coverage and awards received, the Plaintiffs have extensive goodwill and reputation in their product.2 The Defendant’s imitation itself is a testament to the Plaintiffs’ reputation and goodwill.3  D.  Common law rights in trade dress: A shape can also be protected as a trade mark, if it is used as a source identifier. Plaintiffs have common law rights in the trade dress and get-up in their Bottles comprising of unique and distinctive non-functional visual features, such as the monochromatic colour scheme, two-toned rimmed and rounded cap bearing a different colour, manner of depiction of text and label, indentations and embellishments. Such a cumulative combination of visual features results in a distinctive trade dress, which creates a strong visual impression in the mind of the consumer, and thus, Plaintiffs’ unique trade dress acts as a source identifier.  clarification of the ex-parte ad-interim injunction granted vide order dated 23rd February, 2021, seeking that the Defendant be allowed to use a proposed design disclosed in the said application, which was being adopted in addition to the bottle/flask design impugned in the present suit. The same was dismissed as not maintainable vide order dated 11th October 2021.",

                        "content": "Mr. Chandar M. Lall, Senior Counsel for the Defendant, on the other hand, has laid a challenge to the Plaintiffs’ Registered Design itself and denies any infringement or passing-off. His submissions are as follows:  A.  The present suit has been filed with mala fide intentions and is an attempt to drive out legitimate competition.  B.  Defendant is a reputed liquor manufacturer and has sold more than 35 lakh cases of ‘GOA’ branded products in the last 3 years, with over INR 100 crores in sales for FY 2019-2020. The ‘GOA’ mark of Defendant has no resemblance to the Plaintiffs’ brands viz. ‘VAT 69’, ‘BLACK DOG’ and ‘BLACK & WHITE’.  C.  Defendant prominently displays its mark ‘GOA’ on all its products and the same is widely recognised by customers. The presence of such apparently different brands completely eliminates any chances of confusion between them.  D.  The Plaintiffs are not the creators or proprietors of the design: Plaintiffs admitted in Interrogatory No. 1 that the ‘creator’ of the Hipster design is an agency named Love Creative. There is no pleading relating to Love Creative, as only website pages of Love Creative have been shown in the plaint, which cannot fulfil the requirement of Section 2(j) of the Designs Act. Since there is no pleading that the said author has executed the work for Plaintiffs for good consideration, or has assigned the same to the Plaintiffs, and no documentation has been shown to this effect either, the mandate of Section 2(j) of the Designs Act has not been met. Thus, prima facie the registration is liable to be cancelled.  E.  Invalid Designs under the Designs Act: Unlike trademarks and copyrights, patents and designs laws are strictly based upon validity of registration. If registrations are prima facie invalid, then any monopoly therein ends, and the design falls to the public domain, which includes  the right to freely copy.4 Under designs law, Registration is not prima facie evidence of validity. In cases where there is a serious challenge to a design, or where a design is new and has not been tested, injunctions should not be granted.5 The test, under designs law, is not from a consumer’s point of view, but of an instructed person having knowledge of the state-of-the-art and common-to-trade aspects of the design.  F.  Plaintiffs’ Registered Design No. 306577 is liable to be cancelled under Sections 19(1)(b), 19(1)(c), 19(1)(d) read with 2(d), 2(g), 2(j), 4(c), and 22(3) of the Designs Act, on the following grounds:  (i)  The design stands disclosed through prior art: The shape and configuration of Plaintiffs’ Bottles, is “inspired” from hip flasks, and is extremely common to the liquor trade, being already in use by other brands, as is evident from the visual representation below:  In fact, both the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s bottles are mere trade-variants of the hip flask, and hence not registrable. Moreover, an admission to this effect is filed by Plaintiffs in the form of a newspaper interview filed as annexure-10, where they admit to such inspiration.  (ii)  The Hipster’s design is not new and original. The registration is liable to be cancelled as the design is not new, novel or original. The introduction of ordinary trade variants into an old design cannot make it new or original.6 Some of the pre-existing designs are:  The term “new and useful” is a recognised term used in relation to a primarily utilitarian function, and hence, would be the subject matter of a patent; whereas, under designs law, ‘novelty’ means “new and original”. The moment the creator says a design is not ‘novel’, in effect, what is being stated is that it is not new and original. Further, the Plaintiffs had claimed that the design was “new and useful” in their response to the interrogatories; and now cannot be permitted to refute their stance by way of a note on arguments. Under Section 4(c) of the Designs Act, a design should be “significantly distinguishable from known designs or combination of known designs”. Small infinitesimal changes are not sufficient to constitute a ‘new’ or ‘novel’ or ‘original’ design.  (iii)  The Hipster’s design is functional: The use of the terms ‘pocket scotch’ or ‘Hipster’ in the plaint, in relation to Plaintiffs’ Registered Design, is indication that the design in issue is utilitarian in nature. Its shape and configuration is designed to fit a  hip-pocket, taking inspiration from a hip flask. The argument that the design was inspired by the smartphone is fallacious, since the designs of a smartphone and hip flask are similar to each other to the extent that both fulfil one basic utilitarian aspect of fitting in a pocket.  (iv)  The Plaintiff has contended that the design is “inspired from the smartphone” and is “unlike the shape of traditional flasks”; whereas, on its website, it is mentioned that the Hipster is a “hip-flask-size pack”. A party cannot be permitted to take a stand before the Court contrary to what has otherwise been represented to the public for commercial benefits.7 In fact, this is not the first instance that the Plaintiffs have been accused of fraudulently claiming rights in ordinary bottle shapes.8  (v)  Mosaicing is impermissible under Section 4(c) of the Designs Act.9 A different combination of familiar contrivances cannot be injuncted.10  G.  There is no similarity in the overall trade dress of the two products, which could cause confusion or deception. There are several differences between the shape, get-up and pricing of the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Bottles, and hence, no injunction is warranted. They are a few millimetres different in size. Afterall, bottles of the same quantity  are bound to have only slight variations from each other, and will have the same height if they have the same bottom circumference.11  H.  No injunction is liable to be granted as the Defendant has raised a credible challenge to Plaintiffs’ Registered Design. Moreover, it is a well-settled principle that injunction does not follow as a matter of routine in cases when serious disputed questions arise, such as prior publication of the design, lack of originality, trade variation, etc.12  I.  There can be no restrain qua passing off in a registered design. 13 Plaintiffs’ Bottles are constituted of common-to-trade elements, and therefore, no distinctiveness can be claimed in the overall get-up. No case for passing off can be made by merely showing imitation of parts of the get-up of goods which are common-to-the-trade.14 Hence, the shape of a bottle which is a registered design is to be disregarded for the purpose of passing off.  J.  Without prejudice to the contention that Defendant has not copied Plaintiffs’ products; nonetheless, even a conscious attempt to copy, in itself, does not constitute either infringement or passing off.  2 Reliance was placed on: Cello Household Products v.

                        "content": "On the issue of effect of registration, as prima facie evidence of validity, a juxtaposition is drawn between the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act specifically notes that “Registration shall be prima facie evidence of validity”. Curiously, there is no such corresponding section in the Designs Act, which is a later statute. This, by necessary corollary, means that the drafters intended that no such implication is to be drawn for registration of designs. The reason for this difference in treatment of a registered design vis-a-vis a registered trade mark, lies in the registration process. While both applications invite objections before the Examiner/ Controller, only trade mark applications are advertised for ‘opposition’ in terms of Section 21 of the Trade Marks Act. Oppositions, if any, are then adjudicated by the Registrar of Trade Marks on the basis of statement(s) and counter-statement(s), after duly hearing the applicant and opponent. These steps are undertaken prior to the grant of registration. In contrast, public opposition stage is wholly missing in the design registration process. Under Section 5(1) of the Designs Act, for registering a design, the Controller is essentially to consider whether (or not) the design applied for has previously been published in another country, and whether it is contrary to public order or morality. Thereafter, such design is made open to public inspection by way of publication only post-registration, in terms of Section 7 of the Designs Act. Hence, the only remedy available to an aggrieved person qua registration of a design, is to apply for cancellation after the grant. This is the reason Section 22(3) allows a  defendant in a suit for infringement of design, to take all defences available under Section 19 in respect of cancellation of design. Unsurprisingly, there is no corresponding section in the Trade Marks Act to Section 22(3) of the Designs Act.  (ii) where any person acquires the design or the right to apply the design to any article, either exclusively of any other person or otherwise, means, in the respect and to the extent in and to which the design or right has been so acquired, the person by whom the design or right is so acquired; and  (iii) in any other case, means the author of the design; and where the property in or the right to apply, the design has devolved from the original proprietor upon any other person, includes that other person.  19 Upon a query of the Court on this aspect during a listing of the matter on 15th July 2022, Mr. Kapil Wadhwa, counsel for the Defendant stated that an application for cancellation has been filed, but the authority is yet to serve the Plaintiff, as per rules, which is corroborated by the counsel for the Plaintiffs.  20 Reliance placed on: Niki Tasha India Pvt Ltd. v.

Thus, to see whether the imitation is obvious, the same should strike at once on a visual comparison of the article containing the registered design and the article containing the design which is said to be infringing the registered design. The impugned design should be very close to the original design -the resemblance of the original design being immediately apparent to the eye while looking at the two designs. Fraudulent imitation is one which is deliberately based upon the registered design. The imitation may be less apparent than an obvious imitation. There may be subtle distinction between the registered design and the alleged fraudulent imitation, and yet the fraudulent imitation although different in some respects from the original, renders it as a perceptible imitation when the two designs are closely scanned.”  xx  … xx … xx “163.

While applying this test, the Court is also conscious that not every resemblance between the two designs would amount to infringement. The comparison by the eye has been done by physically holding in hand the Defendant’s impugned bottle alongside the Plaintiffs’. Unequivocally, at first blush, the Defendant’s impugned bottles bear a remarkable similarity to the Hipster. All the unique, essential and novel features of the Hipster: long, lean and sleek design, curved shoulders, ‘v’ element on the neck, etc. are found on the impugned bottle as well. In terms of shape, the bottles have identical necks, shoulders, joints and edges. Both are identically rectangular in shape, and have a dimpled bottom, which, indeed is nearly-identical and has sufficient similarity to make it difficult for the consumer to distinguish one from the other. In fact, even upon undertaking a microscopically detailed examination, or applying the instructed eye test, only three points of difference emerge: firstly, the Defendant’s bottle has a crest-shaped logo of the Defendant’s company embossed on the upper portion at the front, whereas the Hipster is plain. Secondly, the Defendant’s bottle is a few millimetres shorter and very slightly more bulbous than the Hipster. Thirdly, and lastly, the neck of the impugned product is about one millimetre shorter. However, when examined from a distance of three to five yards, which is a reasonable distance between a potential consumer and the shelf of a liquor store where the bottles may be  displayed together, the differences vaporise.25 Besides, the impugned design need not be an exact replica to constitute infringement. Minor changes in size are insignificant as the overall and substantial similarity is glaring and undeniably apparent to the naked eye. The Court is, thus, satisfied that Defendant’s product is deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs’ Registered Design.  22 Reliance was placed on: Alert India v.

Plaintiffs claim to have spent approximately 1.5 million GBP on conceptualization, design and commercial development of the Hipster, and have spent an additional 1.9 million GBP to set up a supply distribution chain globally; whereas the Defendant had to incur no such expenses. Sales figures submitted with the plaint, too, show that from May, 2019 to September, 2020, as per the Chartered Accountant’s certificate presented by the Plaintiffs, net sales were recorded as INR 100.73 crore against 95623 cases of Plaintiffs’ goods; whereas the Defendant has admittedly sold inventory only worth INR 24 lakhs.

If a design is not new or original, then, the same cannot be registered. The expression “new” is not defined under the Act but the expression “original” is defined under the Act i.e., in Section 2 (g).

Elaborating further, what is new is quite obvious in that it comes into existence for the first time, however, a design may not be new in the sense it may already be available in the public domain, however, in its application for a particular purpose it may be totally original in the application which was not otherwise conceived of and therefore can amount to a new creation for commercial application thus entitling the same to copyright protection.” [Emphasis Supplied]",

The test for determining novelty under designs law is no longer res integra, and has been observed by this Court in Steelbird Hi-Tech India Ltd. v. S.P.S. Gambhir & Ors., 30 as follows:  “It is rightly held in the cases decided that in the matter of novelty the eye is to be the ultimate test and the determination has to be on the normal ocular impression. In order to know its newness or originality it is necessary that a design identical with or even materially similar to the relevant design should not have been published or registered previously. A slight trivial or infinitesimal variation, from a pre-existing design will not qualify it for registration. Taking into account the nature of the article involved, the change introduced should be substantial. It is not necessary to justify registration that the whole of the design should be new, the newness may be confined to only a part of it but that part must be a significant one and it should be potent enough to impart to the whole design a distinct identity, unless registration is sought for the said part alone.”  [Emphasis Supplied]",

It is a matter of first impression. In The Wimco Ltd. v. Meena Match Industries, AIR 1983 Del 537, the Court held that “in the matter of novelty the eye has to be the ultimate arbiter and the determination has to rest on the general ocular impression. The court has to consider and look at the two designs in question with an instructed eye and say whether there is or there is not such a substantial difference between them that which has been published previously and the registered design to say that at the date of registration that was not published in India previously.”.”  [Emphasis Supplied]",

This was elucidated by the Supreme Court in Bharat Glass (supra), in the following words:  “36. (...) Therefore, the concept of design is that a particular figure conceived by its designer in his mind and it is reproduced in some identifiable manner and it is sought to be applied to an article. Therefore, whenever registration is required then those configuration has to be chosen for registration to be reproduced in any article. The idea is that the design has to be registered which is sought to be reproduced on any article. Therefore, both the things are required to go together, i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article.  “44. Our attention was invited to Gammeter v. Controller of Patents & Designs and others A.I.R. 1919 Cal. 887. Their Lordships discussed the concept of new and original. In that context, it was observed as follows:  “A design in order to be new or original within the meaning of the Act, need not be new or original in the sense of never having been seen before as applied to any article whatever, there might be a novelty in applying an old thing to a new use, provided it is not merely analogous. Where the design of a metal band called the “Novelty band,” intended to attach a  watch to the wrist, was similar in shape and configuration to a bracelet previously manufactured for ornamental purpose.”  Their Lordships further held as follows:  “Though the shape of the “Novelty” band by itself could not be said to be new and original, the application of it to a watch to be worn on the wrist was for a purpose so different from and for a use so similar to the purpose and use of the bracelet that the design in question might be said to be original.”  Therefore, this case also depended on the appreciation of the material placed before the Court.”",

                        "content": "Needless to say, a bottle/hip flask is not a new or novel invention by itself; they have been used for the purpose of carrying liquid since time immemorial and their design certainly lies in the public domain. The innovation and novelty of the design, as conceptualised in the mind of its author, lies not in the bottle/flask design, but in the “shape and configuration” as applied to a bottle. Plaintiffs’ claim is that no one has applied a shape inspired by smartphones to liquor bottles prior to the Plaintiffs. Mr. Sibal had elaborated on this creative idea of converting the 180 ml bottle into the portable Hipster flask, in a deliberately smaller format, to say that the aim was to attract young aspirational drinkers who may have lower disposable incomes and are not be able to afford the expense of larger 750 ml bottles. Indeed, the design has the ubiquity; it is travel-sized slim, glossy, angular, and has fit-in-the-pocket characteristics of the smartphone. To that effect, it is also not the Defendant’s case that there exists a prior-publication which is based upon the lean and thin design of a smartphone. The Plaintiffs’ product is the first in the market to take the visually-appealing features of a smartphone and apply it to pre-packaged alcohol. None of the third-party products shown by the Defendant are pre-filled flasks which have the striking ocular attraction of the Hipster bottles. The Defendant has shown no other  manufacturer/ distributor of alcohol that prefills and sells their product in a bottle that look and feel like that of the Plaintiffs’. It also weighs on the mind of the Court, as further evidence of originality, that Plaintiffs’ Registered Design had been conceptualised and designed after undertaking extensive research and development. The mental activity that has gone into conceiving the design is exhibited in this novel concept in the bottling industry which has been in existence for quite some time. The aesthetic appeal (or in other words, the pleasing, attractive appearance) which is the sum total of the configuration of the unique features discussed above (rounded shoulders, V neck, symmetrical design, raised front and back etc.) is the novelty that needs protection. It is not just a trade variant of previous design, as sought to be trivialised by the Defendant. A bottle is undoubtedly a common article which has common features, such as neck, shoulders, etc. It is an article that offers limited artistic freedom to innovate. Yet, it has been significantly transformed in the Hipster, with distinguishable features, giving it an aesthetic appeal that had not been conceived hereinbefore. This clearly meets the threshold of ‘new and original’ as it creates an altogether different impression on an informed user, entitling the Plaintiff to exclusivity. Undoubtedly, a transformed bottle will still remain a bottle, but that is not the test to be applied. Accepting this argument would only mean that for common articles, there can be no ‘new or original’ product. That would hinder innovation, creativity and inspiration which can never be the intent or theme of laws relating to intellectual properties.",

If that were so, we should never see any new or original design at all. It is a general rule that “mosaicing” of prior art, i.e., combining selected features in different prior art publications, is not permissible when assessing whether an invention is new. Conversely, mosaicing is also no defence to a charge of infringement of a registered design. Mosaicing contemplates taking known integers or combinations and simply re-arranging them. In a situation like ours, it might for example apply if Cello laid claim to a very similar bottle with a similar shape, configuration and ornamentation but merely repositioned the ornamentation by setting it horizontally rather than vertically and doing not much else besides.

Passing off action is founded on: (i) the use of a mark in the trade for sale of the Plaintiffs’ goods; (ii) the generation of reputation and goodwill as a consequences of trade; and (iii) the association of the mark with the Plaintiffs’ goods, and (iv) the misrepresentation sought to be created by the Defendant by its use of such mark, so as to deceptively portray that its goods originate from the Plaintiffs. On this issue, one immediately recalls the classical trinity test laid down in the Jiff Lemon case,39 which has been recently revisited by a coordinate bench of this Court in RB Health (US) LLC & Anr. v. Dabur India Ltd., 40 as follows:  “17. Passing off is a tortious action for deceit. For such an action to succeed, it must have, in the very least, the following three indicias, commonly known as the “classical trinity”. The said markers are articulated in what is commonly known as the Jiff Lemon case [Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. vs. Borden Inc., [1990] 1 All E.R. 873] and can, broadly, be paraphrased in the manner set forth hereafter.  i.  First, the plaintiff must be able to establish that it has the necessary goodwill and reputation in the goods sold or services offered to the consumers at large which in turn should be interlinked with the get-up in which they are proffered.  ii.  Second, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that the defendant’s misrepresentation qua the goods or services offered by him have led consumers to believe that they originate from the plaintiff.  iii.  Third, that the action of the defendant has resulted in damage or is likely to result in damage on account of the misrepresentation of the defendant with regard to the origin of the goods and services.  39 Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc., [1990] 1 All E.R. 873.  40 2021 (276) DLT 64.",

Consequently, this brings me to the submission of the plaintiffs that the defendant’s use of the infringed mark constitutes passing off. In this connection, let me reiterate the well known parameters of what constitutes passing off. Passing off as is ubiquitously held in most jurisdictions subject to usual turn of phrase or change of phraseology, a tort of false representation, whether intentional or unintentional whereby, one person attempts to sell his goods or services as those manufactured or rendered by another which is “calculated” to damage the goodwill of that other person. Thus, the necessary ingredients which a plaintiff in an action of passing off is required to prove, is the:  (i)  employment of deception. Mere confusion will not suffice;  (ii)  intent is not a necessary as long as the unwary consumer is deceived; and  (iii)  the act of the tort should injure the goodwill not just his reputation.(...)”“ [Emphasis Supplied]",

Immediately, it is noticed that the Hipster is marketed in three colour variants: white, golden and black. The Defendant’s bottles are in the colour variants red and black. Whilst all the bottles are in a dual-chromatic scheme, there is indeed some grain of truth in the Defendant’s submission that the black-and-gold combination is common to trade, and has been used by a plethora of alcohol manufacturers. Mr. Lall had produced various such trade dresses, which are extracted below:  Similarly, a two-toned rimmed and rounded cap, too, has been widely used in the said industry and is not unique to the Plaintiffs. Hence, upon a comparison of the trade dress as a whole, the Court cannot prima facie agree that the essential features are distinctive enough to become a source identifier. Apart from the black & gold colour scheme, there is hardly any similarity in the labels, trade dress, and get-up. Thus, the Court is not entirely convinced that the same is being imitated by the Defendant to deceive unwary customers. The Court is further prima facie unconvinced that the purported imitation of the Hipster’s trade dress by the Defendant has resulted in some tangible confusion with regard to the origin or source of the goods, considering that the ‘GOA’ brand is boldly displayed on the bottle, the labels are largely dissimilar, and the price points of the goods are vastly different.",

This claim of the Plaintiff is analysed squarely on the aspect of passing off of the trade dress, overall get-up, and presentation of the product through packaging. Even on the above noted aspect, there are undeniably some similarities which are quite visible, but they are largely occurring because of identical designs (for which the plaintiff is entitled to injunction on account of design infringement) and the mono-chromactic colour of the bottles.

The operative portion of the said order dated 17th August, 2021, is set out below:  •12. The Court thus finds a prima facie case in favour of the Plaintiff. They are a prior adopter, user and owner since 1948, and the prior registered proprietor of well-known trademarks 'Delhi Public School' and 'DPS'. The use of the impugned mark-'Delhi Public International School'/ 'DPIS' and the impugned logo, is deceptively similar to the mark of the Plaintiff-Society and is in breach/ violation of the decree passed by this Court against Mr. Pal. The adoption of the impugned marks is thus prima facie invalid. Besides, considering that parties are in the field of education, deliberate adoption by the Defendants of impugned trade marks and logo that are deceptively similar and/or identical to the Plaintiffs registered trade marks/names and logos can cause confusion in the minds of the parents, prospective students and staff desirous of securing admission or availing services, seeing the advertisements, promotional material, admission forms, boards/ hoardings, etc. They are bound to be misled into availing the services of the Defendant-School, under the belief that they are those of the Plaintiff-Society. Mr. Mittal has demonstrated that the Defendant-School has intentionally misrepresented itself to be in association with the Plaintiff-Society due to the prominence of 'Delhi Public School'.

Accordingly, till the next date of hearing, the Defendants, their trustees, directors, managing committee members, office bearers, employees, delegates, representatives, assigns, associates, agents or anybody acting on their behalf, are restrained from: - (a) adopting, using and/ or dealing in any manner with the registered trademark of the Plaintiff-'Delhi Public  School' and 'DPS' and logo or any other trademark that is identical or deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs aforenoted trademark amounting to infringement of the Plaintiffs said trade marks; (b) offering for sale, adopting, using and/or dealing in any manner with the registered trade mark of the Plaintiff-'Delhi Public School' and 'DPS' and logo [  ] of the Plaintiff or any other trade mark  identical or deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs trade mark amounting to passing off the Plaintiffs said trademark and further restraining the Defendants from representing in any manner that they are connected with the Plaintiff; and  (c)  using or dealing in any manner with the impugned trademark/ names 'Delhi Public International School'",

Alleged infringementwould requireto be tested on the anvil of these rights and when so examined it is crystal clear that dubbing the remadeTelugu film in Hindi cannot even remotely amountto infringement of Plaintiff’s copyrights. The  test of infringement is not the degree of similarity between Telugu film dubbed in Hindi andthe Malayalam film dubbed in Hindi and, therefore, the question that is to be posed is whether dubbing theTelugu film in Hindi, in order to communicate it to thepublic, is an exclusiveright of thePlaintiff. If the answer is in the affirmative, Plaintiff may have a cause of action. Clearly, no such right hasbeen assignedto the Plaintiff and on the contrary, it is the exclusive right of Defendant No. 1 as producer of the Telugu film to dub the Telugu film in Hindi.

This contention is misconceived in as much as an unexecuted document does not have theeffect of novation of a signed agreement and moreover is of no consequence as theexecuted Agreement dated 18.03.2020 confers the right to dub the suit film into all languages including Hindi. It is wrong for thePlaintiff to contend that Defendant No. 1 attempted to expand the scope of acquiredrights under the Agreement dated 18.03.2020, to include dubbing rights in Hindi by insertion of clause 3 and amendment of theAgreement, but remained unsuccessful. If Defendant No. 3 intended to circumscribe/restrict thedubbing right of Defendant No. 1, then the executedAgreement would have clearly and expressly contained a negativecovenant to the effect. Section 2(d)(v) defines ‘author’ to mean in relation to a cinematograph film, the producer. Section 2(f) defines ‘cinematograph film’ to mean any work of visual recording and includes a sound recording accompanying such visual recording. ‘Producer’ is defined in relation to a cinematograph film a person who takes initiative and responsibilityfor making the work. Section 17 of the Act provides that the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein. Therefore, the producer of a cinematograph film is the author andthe author is the first owner of the copyright and Section 14 enumeratesthe exclusive copyrights, which in case of a cinematograph film would include the right to  communicatethe film to public. Section 13(1)(b) stipulates that copyright shall subsist in the cinematograph films while Section 13(3) carves out an exception that if a substantial part of thefilm is an infringement of copyright in anotherwork, the copyrightshall not subsist. Section 51 of the Act lists out the contingencies where the copyright is infringed. Holistic reading of these provisions shows that Plaintiff is bound to show that it has the copyright to makea Telugu remakeof the Malayalam film in order to allege infringementby Defendant No. 1, who hasmade a remake of theMalayalam film in Telugu language and it is the latter which it is dubbed in Hindi. Plaintiff is unable to show any right, leave alone exclusive right under Section 14 of the Act allegedly infringed by Defendant No. 1. In fact, Plaintiffhas no locus to file the present suit against DefendantNo. 1 as there are no pleadings disclosing which copyright, vesting in the Plaintiff, has been infringed by Defendant No. 1, who admittedly has not remade the original Malayalam film in Hindi. Reliance is placed on the judgment in Thiagarajan Kumararaja(supra) for the proposition that producers being the authors are entitled to ownership of cinematograph film and would have all the rightstherein, as conferred underSection 14 (d)(iii) of the Act, which would include the right to dub. Reliance was also placed on Shanthi Thiagarajan v. K. E. Gnanavel Raja and Ors. 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 5341 to contend that once the rights are conferred to remake a movie in a particular language, the right to dub the movie which is remade cannot be questioned andno suit can be filed by the assignor alleging infringement of copyright.",

                        "content": "As far as the commercial viability of the proposed film of the Plaintiff is concerned, as rightly argued by the Defendants, this is a fact or wh ich is wholly irrelevant to the issue of alleged violations of the provisions of t h e Copyright Act, under which an action for infringement can only be predicated on existence of a copyright. Both sides have placed considerable reliance on the observations of the Division Bench in Thiagarajan Kumararaja (supra), wherein the Court has essentially laid down t hat t he producer being the author of a cinematograph film has all t h e rights in t he film as conferred under Section 14(d)(iii) of the Act, including t he righ t t o dub and subtitle, subject, however, to any restrictive condition(s) bein g put by the parties. In view of the aforesaid prima facie finding t hat Defendant No. 1 is not infringing any exclusive right assigned to the Plaintiff by Defendant No. 3, this argument or the observation of the Division Bench at this stage are wholly irrelevant and need not detain the Court, any further.",

                        "content": "This Court also prima facie finds merit in the contention of Defendant No. 1 that the ownership of the copyright in the Telugu film vests in Defendant No. 1. As brought out above, under Section 2(uu) of the Act ‘producer’ in relation to a cinematograph film m eans a person wh o t akes initiative and responsibility for making the ‘work’ and t he producer is t h e ‘author’under Section 2(d)(v). Section 17 clearly provides that the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein and therefore, Defendant No. 1 is the owner of the copyright in t he Telugu film. Th is is further evident from the Assignment Deed dated 18.03.2020, whereby Defendant No. 3 has referred to Defendant No. 1 as a ‘producer’ of the Telugu film and has renounced all rights in the film so produced. Since Defendant No. 1 is the owner of the copyright in the Telugu film, it sh all be  entitled to the exclusive rights of a copyright owner under Section 14(d) of the Act, which would include the right to communicate t he film t o pu blic under Section 14(d)(iii). As held by the Madras High Court in Thiagarajan  Kumararaja (supra), the right to communicate would in clude t he righ t t o dub. Therefore, by the operation of law, Defendant No. 1 in its own righ t as a copyright owner has a right to dub the Telugu film in any language including Hindi and Plaintiff cannot assert any right to rest rain Defendant No. 1 from dubbing the Telugu film in Hindi.",

These judgments, in my view, do n ot com e to the aid of the Plaintiff as in the present case, the assignor under t he Deed of Assignment dated 18.03.2020 has assigned the rights in t he su it film in favour of Defendant No.1, without any restrictions or limitations and pertinent is it to mention that the assignor has in fact renounced all its righ ts in the suit film in favour of Defendant No.1, which is clearly eviden t from the recitals in the Assignment Deed.",
