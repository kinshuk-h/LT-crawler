The understanding, allegedly, was that the video would be used to promote the music album of the Plaintiff and also the musical as and when it is produced. The aforesaid arrangement was never formalised into a written agreement. The further understanding between the parties, as per the Plaintiff, was that a sum of Rs.30 lakhs would be paid by Defendant No.3 to the Plaintiff as consideration. However, only a sum of Rs.10 lakhs was paid. The remaining Rs.20 lakhs remained outstanding. This entire transaction was negotiated sometime between June,  2005  to July-August, 2006. Since no steps had been taken by the Defendants to produce the musical till September, 2006, the Plaintiff decided to launch its music album and accordingly approached Defendant No.3. However, Defendant No.3 imposed two counter conditions at that stage to allow the Plaintiff to use the promotional video. First, the Plaintiff gives Defendant No.3 an agreed percentage of the sales of the Plaintiff’s albums. Second, to give Defendant No.3 credit as ‘presenter’ of the album. The Plaintiff then approached M/s Sagarika Music Pvt. Ltd. for releasing the sound recordings in an album titled-“Kamasutra-Moods of Love” both in CD and cassette form. According to the Plaintiff, he was agreeable with the conditions of Defendant No.3 and took this transaction forward with M/s Sagarika Music Pvt. Ltd. However, this position is disputed by the Defendants. The Plaintiff entered into a contract as per which 70% of the consideration as per the actual sale of the sound recording was to be paid to Defendant No.3.",

On 8th November, 2006, a letter was written by Defendant No.3 to M/s. Sagarika claiming to be the producer of the music album and it was alleged that the Plaintiff had composed music for the Defendants for which he had been paid. The Defendants also filed criminal actions against the Plaintiff and also threatened contempt against M/s Sagarika Music Pvt. Ltd in a letter dated 23rd December, 2006. M/s Sagarika Music then intimated the Plaintiff that since there is a dispute as to the ownership of the music album, it would be unable to release the music album, unless and until an NOC is obtained from the Defendants. This led to a complete stalemate and though the launch itself took place, no CDs and cassettes of the album were released  into the market. Parties exchanged various letters between each other, however, to no avail. On one hand, the Defendants had filed a criminal complaint against the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff on the other hand sought declaration and injunction by way of the present suit.

Since no written statement was filed by the Defendants by the said date, an interim injunction was granted against the Defendants on 17th April, 2007 in the following terms:  “By way of this application, plaintiff has sought injunction praying that the defendants, their principal officers, agents etc. be restrained from directly or indirectly in any manner interfering in the sale, distribution and marketing of the album titled \"Kamasutra-Moods of Love\" containing the songs 'Yeh Kya Ho Raha In-Hai', 'Behka Behka', Mujme Hai Ek', 'Kamasutra Theme', 'Dil Ki Gufa Se', ' Ke Tere Bin Saawan' and 'ishq to'. It is the case of the plaintiff that these songs contained in the album were written, composed, sung and recorded by the plaintiff, but the defendant was unnecessarily interfering in sale and distribution of the album on the ground that defendants have filed a criminal complaint against the plaintiff and defendant has right over these songs. Prima facie plaintiff has a good case and balance of convenience lies in favour of plaintiff.  In view of the fact that written statement has not been  filed despite opportunity, the application of the plaintiff is allowed. Defendants are restrained from interfering in any manner in release and sale of the album containing above songs. Defendants also restrained from using literary work, musical work and sound recordings comprised in the album, till further orders.”",

However, insofar as the costs pertaining to the video and other non-musical expenses were concerned, they were borne by the Defendants. In response to a question as to how PW1 was claiming financial loss of Rs.35 lakhs whereas in his evidence, his expenditure is admitted to be only Rs.4,02,287/-, PW1 stated that there are various losses apart from the expenses which are incurred, for example, composition charges, arrangement charges, studio charges, time spent by him, mixing mastering charges as also his own professional charges. Thus, apart from the external expenses which he incurred; PW1 claimed that he is entitled to at least Rs.35 lakhs for all these charges.

A.  In all the publicity print material released in connection with the said album, it was clearly mentioned on the top cover that 'Showtime Events Presents 'Kamasutra, Moods of Love by Abhishek Ray'. So it is amply clear from this that I had no intentions of bypassing the credit of the defendants though I had not been paid in full. Along with this in my contract with Sagarika Music Pvt Ltd, I had given 70% of the total share of proceeds from album sales to defendant no.3 and only kept 30% for myself.

It is true that in the contract executed between myself and M/s Sagarika Music Pvt Ltd it was mentioned that I had the copyright of the album 'Kamasutra, Moods of Love'.

(Vol., at the time of release of the aforesaid album Kamasutra, Moods, of Love, defendant no.3 sent an official mail as well as a number of phone calls to M/s Sagarika Pvt Ltd claiming that it was the absolute owner of the complete album and threatened of dire consequences if the album was released without its permission. At that stage M/s Sagarika Pvt Ltd asked  me to produce an No Objection Certificate from defendant no.3 regarding the video which was shot on one of my songs \"Behka Behka\").

(2)  Defendant Nos.1 to 3, apart from paying the sum of Rs.10 lakhs, did not have any other input in the production of the music album ‘Kamasutra-Moods of Love’.  (3)  Defendant Nos.1 to 3 intended to launch the musical ‘Kamasutra-A Musical of Love’ towards which they produced the video. The rights in the said video were with Defendant Nos.1 to 3, however, the said video also consisted of various underlying works, which belong to the Plaintiff.  (4)  Insofar as the sum of Rs.30 lakhs is concerned, there is a dispute as to whether the sum of Rs.30 lakhs was agreed upon between the parties. However, the admitted position is the payment of Rs.10 lakhs was made by the Defendants to the Plaintiff. The said amount of Rs.10 lakhs remain with the Plaintiff and has not been returned.  (5) No payment has been made by the Plaintiff for the production of the promotional video, which the Defendants produced as a precursor to the musical.  (6) The drafts of the agreements for the musical and music album were exchanged. The main draft, which was almost agreed to except clause 2.2 of the said Agreement, clearly recognized that the Defendants  would produce the musical and the Plaintiff assigns only the sound recording of the album for the purpose of production of the musical. As per the draft agreement, wherein the only disputed portion by the Defendants was clause 2.2, the consideration payable was 85% of the profits from the sale of music tracks to Defendant No.3 and 15% to the Plaintiff. However, this agreement never came to be signed.  (7) Insofar as the correspondence is concerned, the letters show that around the time when the agreement was being negotiated and the launch of the music album was announced, the Defendants admittedly filed a criminal complaint and also alleged contempt of Court against M/s. Sagarika Music Pvt. Ltd. This led to the M/s. Sagarika Music Pvt. Ltd. shelving the release of the album of the Plaintiff and calling upon the Plaintiff to obtain NOC from Defendant Nos.1 to 3.",

The name •HERO•, •HERO ELECTRIC• and various variants of the same are registered in Class 12, registered between 2008 and 2020. The HERO formative marks are also used on the various websites of the Plaintiffs including www.heroelectric.in, which was registered in the name of the Hero Group in December, 2006. The mark •HERO• has acquired enormous goodwill and reputation and though being a dictionary word, it is today -in the automobile industry -distinctive of the Plaintiffs and its products/services. The sales figures of the Plaintiffs under the trademark •HERO ELECTRIC• are more than 315 crores in the year 2021 and the advertisement figures are to the tune of Rs.24 crores. The Plaintiffs have launched e-bikes, e-scooters and other electric vehicles under the mark •HERO ELECTRIC•, which have also been accorded with various awards in the mobility industry. The mark •HERO ELECTRIC• is thus claimed to be distinctive and well-reputed.",

Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, submits that the Respondent No.1 has adopted an almost identical mark for an identical class of goods which also have the same trade channels. The Respondent No.1 is also using the blue logo and ‘Heaven’ in an identical manner. It is his submission that the blue logo and the word ‘Heaven’ are the  essential and prominent feature of the Petitioner’s mark “BLUE HEAVEN”. According to the ld. counsel for the Petitioner, the adoption and registration of the mark “MARC HEAVEN” by Respondent No.1 is hit by Sections 9 and 11 of the Act. He relies upon Section 9(2)(a) of the Act to argue that if a mark is of such nature as is likely to cause confusion or deceive the public, then the same cannot be registered. Under Section 11 of the Act, it is submitted that since the Petitioner’s trademarks were prior registered and prior used, the said mark ought to have been cited against the Respondent No.1’s mark in the examination report and the registration ought not to be granted to Respondent No.1’s mark “MARC HEAVEN”. Accordingly, rectification of Respondent No.1’s mark is sought in view of Section 57 of the Act and orders are prayed for rectification/cancellation of the said mark. The relief sought in the petition is as under:  “i. Remove/cancel/expunge the entry pertaining to the impugned trademark/label “ ” registered under No.4111088 in class-03 from the Register of Trademarks with exemplary costs in favour of the Petitioner and against the Respondent No. 1 ;  ii.

The relevant observation is as follows- “While the basic rule is that marks must be compared in their entireties and not dissected, in articulating reasons  for reaching a conclusion on the issue of confusion, there is nothing improper in stating that, for rational reasons, more or less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests on consideration of the marks in their entireties. Although it is not proper to dissect a 'mark,' one feature of a mark may be more significant and it is proper to give greater force and effect to that dominant feature. Thus, as a preliminary to comparing marks in their entireties, it is not improper to downplay the similarity of very descriptive parts of conflicting marks.”",

The mark `BLUE HEAVEN’ is thus an inherently distinctive mark.

The question in such a case would be as to whether mere appearance of the said stitching pattern would perform a trademark function i.e., associate the jeans with the Plaintiff. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative then the pattern would be construed as a trademark deserving protection. There may be a large number of stitching patterns which may be merely for aesthetic or visual appeal. However, when a trademark owner’s stitching pattern per se identifies the jeans, even without a name or a logo, then the intention of the proprietor is for the pattern to perform the function of a trademark. In such a case, the Court would have to examine as to whether the stitching pattern has an ‘acquired meaning’, or is distinctive per se. The test of acquired meaning is similar to the test of secondary meaning applied to descriptive words. In McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition [4th Ed., Vol.1,], J. Thomas McCarthy while dealing with geometric shapes as trademark formats opines as under:  “However, uncommon or unusual shapes and symbols that contain some minimum amount of inventiveness or fancifulness can be regarded as inherently distinctive and  protected as such, without the need for proof of secondary meaning. The issue is whether this shape is so unusual for this type of goods or services that its distinctiveness can be assumed.”",

In addition to its status as an incontestable registered mark, the Levi’s arcuate mark is a fanciful design which has no function other than as a source indicator. Furthermore, assuming Levi needed to establish secondary meaning, Levi has presented evidence of widespread advertising and promotion of Levi’s jeans featuring the Levi’s arcuate mark, continuous use of the mark for more than a century, and sales of more than 800 million pair of jeans bearing the Levi’s mark since 1971. Evidence of sales success, advertising expenditures, and length and exclusivity of use are factors relevant to a determination of the strength of a mark.  Xxx  In the present case, the Levi acurate mark is not merely a fragment of a larger mark including the Levi name but instead has an independent degree of recognition and connection with Levi Strauss, unlike, for example, the McGregor-Drizzle mark in McGregor-Doniger, supra.”",

The said decision has been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit in Lois Sportwear, U.S.A., Inc., v. Levi Strauss & Co. 799 F.2d 867 (1986). The observations of the said Court establish, without any doubt, the global reputation in the ‘Arcuate Stitching Design’ mark. The same reads –  “We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee. When the Polaroid factors are applied to the undisputed facts in the instant case within the context of the proper likelihood of confusion possibilities, it is clear that the district court was correct in enjoining appellants' use of appellee's trademark back pocket stitching pattern. Judge Sweet's opinion evidences an excellent understanding of the trademark law of this Circuit. While appellants' trade dress may dispel some point-of-sale confusion engendered by appellants' use of appellee's distinctive trademark, the labeling does nothing to prevent consumers from mistakenly assuming that appellee is somehow associated with appellants or has consented to the mark's use. Also, the record shows the distinct likelihood of post-sale confusion. In light of the undisputed evidence which compels these legal conclusions, summary judgment in favor of appellee was appropriate. In short, we hold that the Lanham Act forecloses one jeans manufacturer from using another jeans manufacturer's distinctive back pocket stitching pattern trademark when the evidence is undisputed that the trademark  stitching pattern is intimately associated with its owner and the infringing use likely will cause confusion as to the source of the jeans and an unfair shift of goodwill.”",

Since 1873, the company has stitched the back pocket of its jeans with two connecting arches that meet in the center of the pocket; Levi Strauss holds a federally registered trademark on this \"Arcuate\" design. Sales of garments bearing the Arcuate mark have accounted for more than ninety-five percent of Levi Strauss's revenue over the past thirty years, totaling roughly fifty billion dollars.

However, vide its letter dated 20.11.2014, the respondent  categorically rejected the Petitioner’s request for withdrawal stating the Petitioner’s application under Section 33(3A) of the Copyright Act was still under consideration. The petitioner then started working on its functioning and made a representation on 11.01.2018 before the respondent, informing the respondent of the various positive initiatives and developments undertaken by the petitioner towards its members and licensees.",

                        "content": "Further the contention of respondent No.2/RMPL is three fold viz. a) the petitioner though sought re-registration vide letter dated 2013, but sought its withdrawal and hence its application automatically stood surrendered. Even otherwise the petitioners were not desirous to continue to function as a society as despite the Central Government declined to accept their letter, the petitioner had actually withdrawn its application for re-registration by its conduct since it started taking licenses from the assignees / authors and started acting as authors for giving licenses to various persons, hence to say that their application was pending is totally frivolous; b) the Central Government was rather satisfied the petitioners were mismanaging hence, it did not grant re registration and it was well within its power under Section 33 (4) of the Copyright Act; and c) the petitioners rather elected to act as assignees of the authors and hence could not have claimed any lien over re-registration of its candidature as once it had elected a position, it could not have changed its position to its benefit if the registration was awarded to respondent No.2. Reference  was made to Karam Kapahi and Others vs. Lal Chand 2010 (4) SCC 753, wherein the Court held as under:  “53. In the old equity case of Streatfield Vs. Streatfield (White and Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity, 9th Edition, Volume I, 1928) this principle has been discussed in words which are so apt and elegant that I better quote them: \"Election is the obligation imposed upon a party by Courts of equity to choose between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims in cases where there is a clear intention of the person from whom he derives one that he should not enjoy both. Every case of election, therefore, presupposes a plurality of gifts or rights, with an intention, express or implied, of the party who has a right to control one or both that one should be a substitute for the other. The party who is to take has a choice, but he cannot enjoy the benefit of both. The principle is stated thus in Jarman on Wills \"That he who accepts a benefit under a deed or will must adopt the whole contents of the instrument, conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every right inconsistent with it\" (h). The principle of the doctrine of election is now well settled.\"  In National Insurance Company vs. Mastan and Others 2006 (2) SCC 641, the Court held as under:  “23. The 'doctrine of election' is a branch of 'rule of estoppel', in terms whereof a person may be precluded by his actions or conduct or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he otherwise would have had. The doctrine of election postulates that when two remedies are available for the same relief the aggrieved party has the option to elect either of them but not both. Although there are certain exceptions to the same rule but the same has no application in the instant case.”",

It was argued there is, hence, allow the petition or to remand the matter only on this Court. The  reliance is made to Dharmapal Satyapal Limited vs. Deputy  Commissioner of Central Excise 2015 (8) SCC 519:  “45. Keeping in view the aforesaid principles in mind, even when we find that there is an infraction of principles of natural justice, we have to address a further question as to whether any purpose would be served in remitting the case to the authority to make fresh demand of amount recoverable, only after issuing notice to show cause to the Appellant.

Having regard to the fact that the petitioner’s communication dated 20.05.2014 was expressly rejected by the respondent vide its communication dated 20.11.2014, and the subsequent correspondence between the parties treating the petitioner’s application as a live application, the petitioner has made out a case for a limited ad interim order. However, I am of the view that an order restraining the respondent from processing any other application would not be appropriate at this stage, particularly as no other applicant is even a party before this Court. Suffice it to clarify that, in the event the petitioner succeeds in the present petition, its application for re-registration dated 09.05.2013 under Rule 47 of the Rules would stand revived, and would have to be examined on its own merits. This position will be borne in mind by the respondent, and the respondent shall not take any action inconsistent with this position during the pendency of the present petition. In the event the respondent is considering any other application for registration in the interim, the applicant will also be  informed of the pendency of this petition and the contents of this order.”",

Therefore, the situs for filing of this suit would be governed by the provisions of CPC. Section 15 of the CPC provides that every suit is to be instituted in the lowest grade competent to try it. Section 16 of the CPC provides that subject to pecuniary and other limitations prescribed by law, suits in respect of the immovable property of various kinds are to be instituted in the court within whose local limits the property is situated. If immovable property was situated within jurisdiction of different courts, the suit could be instituted in any one of these courts within the local limits of whose jurisdiction any portion of the property was situated. Section 18 of the CPC deals with the place of the institution of the suits when local limits of jurisdiction of courts were uncertain. Section 19 of the CPC provides that a suit for compensation for wrong done to the person or to movable property, if done within the local limits of the jurisdiction of one court whereas the defendant resided or carried out business, etc., within the local limits of the jurisdiction of another court, the suit could be instituted at the option of the plaintiff in either of the said courts. Finally, Section 20 of the CPC provides as under: - “20. Other suits to be instituted where defendants reside or cause of action arises.—Subject to the limitations aforesaid,  every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction—  (a)  the defendant, or each of the defendants where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain; or  (b)  any of the defendants, where there are more than one, at the time of the commencement of the suit, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business, or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the leave of the Court is given, or the defendants who do not reside, or carry on business, or personally works for gain, as aforesaid, acquiesce in such institution; or  (c)  The cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.  [Explanation].—A corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in [India] or, in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has also a subordinate office, at such place.”",

If an invitation is accepted by a customer in Delhi, then it becomes an offer made in Delhi for purchasing of the goods advertised on the website, as is the case in the present matter where advertisement is made on IndiaMart by the defendants No.2 & 3 of the products of the defendant No.1. The Division Bench in World Wrestling Entertainment (supra) considered it safe to presume that though the web server was not located in Delhi, but the customers in Delhi who wished to purchase an article  available on the website of the appellant in that case, could access the website on their computer. The purchaser would place the order for the article from his computer in Delhi. The payment would be made either through credit or debit card or through cash on delivery again in Delhi and ultimately, the goods would be delivered to the customer in Delhi. Therefore, it was concluded that the rules that applied to contracts concluded over the telephone would apply with equal vigour to contracts concluded over the internet. In other words, contracts would be completed at the place where the acceptance is communicated. When the transaction between the seller and purchaser occurs through internet i.e., on a website, the offer and acceptance take place instantaneously and the acceptance is also instantaneously communicated to the customer through the internet at Delhi.

The product, as reflected in the brochure of the Defendant No. 2 at page no. 443 and as advertised on IndiaMart by the defendants No.2 & 3 at page no. 437 establish that it is the same product of the defendant No.1 that is advertised on its website, the printout of which is placed on the record as Document No.12 of the  Plaintiff‟s Documents.
