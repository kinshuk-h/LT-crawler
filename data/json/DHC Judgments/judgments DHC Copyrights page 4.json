                        "content": "Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs has made the following submissions:  (i)  Upon the death of Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral, the trademark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ devolved upon the plaintiffs, being the only Class I legal heirs of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral on account of the fact that his son Mr. Nand Lal Gujral had predeceased him.   (ii)  After the said trademark devolved upon the Class I heirs of Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral, it became their absolute property and the children of plaintiffs No.1 and 2 have no right by birth in the said trademarks.  (iii)  Subsequently, plaintiffs have also applied for and obtained several other registrations for ‘MOTI MAHAL’ and MOTI MAHAL formative marks in their name, as detailed in paragraph 5 of the plaint.  (iv)  After expiry of Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral, the plaintiffs have been running the business since 1997 and have exponentially expanded the business in the last 25 years acquiring goodwill and reputation. The plaintiffs now have over 100 franchises and company owned restaurants all over the world. Therefore, all goodwill and reputation in the trademark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ vests with the plaintiffs alone.  (v)  Defendant No.1, being the son of plaintiff No.1 was carrying on business under the trademark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ in a partnership with plaintiff No.1 under the firm ‘Moti Mahal Deluxe Hospitality’, (hereinafter Partnership Firm) from 12th May, 2017.  (vi)  Defendant No.1 is a director in defendant No.2 company, which does not have ‘MOTI MAHAL’ as part of its name and was only permitted to give out franchises under the brand ‘INDI GRILL’.  (vii)  Defendant No.1 and 2 started giving out franchises in respect of the marks ‘MOTI MAHAL and ‘MOTI MAHAL DELUX’ and also started transferring franchises from the Partnership Firm to the defendant No.2, without permission of any of the plaintiffs including his father, plaintiff no. 1.  (viii)  Defendant No.1 was mindful of the fact that any permission/permitted use has to be with consent of the registered proprietor in a written agreement and hence, defendant No.1 forged signatures of plaintiff No.1 on ‘No Objection Certificate’ issued to a third party for change of franchisor from the Partnership Firm to defendant No.2.  (ix)  Not being a Class I legal heir of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral, defendant No.1 has no rights whatsoever over the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ under the laws of inheritance. Merely being a descendant of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral does not entitle defendant No.1 to any rights over the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’.  (x)  Reliance is also placed on Sections 8 and 9 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 to contend that the intellectual property inherited by the plaintiffs was acquired as a self-acquired property of the deceased Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral and not as a coparcenary property and therefore, defendant No.1 cannot have any rights in the same.  (xi)  Just because plaintiff No.1 is a shareholder in defendant No.1 company, defendant No.2 is not entitled to use the trademark owned by plaintiff No.1.  (xii)  Reliance is placed on Section 28 as well as Section 29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 to contend that since there is no written agreement permitting defendants No.1 and 2 to use the aforesaid marks, defendant No.1 has committed infringement.  (xiii)  Reliance is placed on the judgments of Uttam vs Saubhag, MANU/SC/0256/2017; Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Kanpur & Ors. vs. Chander Sen, AIR 1986 SC 1753; judgment dated 07.12.2017 in CS (COMM) 1285 of 2016 titled as M/s MU Eating Point & Anr. vs. Capt.

                        "content": "Per contra, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant No.1 has advanced the following submissions:  (i)  It is not disputed that the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ was coined and adopted by late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral, who also applied for registration of the said trademark on 28th August, 1992 vide Application No. 580007.  (ii)  Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral died intestate on 18th December, 1997 and on that day defendant No.1 was a minor.  (iii)  Reliance was placed on Section 10 (Rule 3) and Sections 19 read with Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (Old Act) to contend that the marks in question devolved on all the legal heirs in the branch of pre-deceased son of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral jointly.  (iv)  Reliance was also placed on Section 100 of the Trademarks Act, 1958 (Old Act), the corresponding provision to which is Section 133 in the Trademarks Act, 1999, (New Act) read with Rule 64 of the Trademarks Rules, 1965 (Old Rules), the corresponding provision to  which is Rule 55 in the Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules, 2017 (New Rules), to contend that the Trademarks Laws also recognise the same principle of successorship as envisaged in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.  (v)  The Trademarks registry imposed a condition at the time of grant of registration that the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ shall be used by Joint Proprietors, which includes all legal heirs of Kundan Lal Gujral. In this regard reliance was placed on Section 24 of the Trademarks Act, 1958, (Old Act), the corresponding provision to which is Section 24 in the Trademarks Act, 1999 (New Act). Therefore, defendant No.1 is a co-owner of the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ in its various combinations.  (vi)  The property inherited by the defendant No. 1 was held in trust for him by his father, plaintiff No.1, as defendant No.1 was a minor when Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral died.  (vii)  The present suit has been filed on account of a matrimonial dispute between plaintiff No.1 and his wife, who is the mother of defendant No.1.  (viii)  Plaintiffs cannot have any objection to defendant No.2 using the mark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ as plaintiff No.1 is a 50% shareholder in the said company.  (ix)  Plaintiffs are not entitled to grant of interim injunction on account of acquiescence as defendant No.2 with the knowledge of plaintiff No.1, has granted franchise of ‘MOTI MAHAL’ on various dates. Reliance in this regard was placed on Section 33 of the Trademarks Act, 1999.  (x)  Defendant No. 1 has filed rectification application on 27th July, 2021 and on 10th August, 2021 and the plaintiffs No.1 to 3 have also filed Counter Statement on 3rd December, 2021.  (xi)  Reliance is placed on the judgments of Vineeta Sharma vs. Rakesh Sharma and Ors.

When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act:  Provided that, if the deceased had left surviving him a female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male relative, specified in that class who claims, through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in Mitakshara Coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this act and not by survivorship.  Explanation 1. -For the purposes of this section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.  Explanation 2. -Nothing contained in the proviso to this section shall be construed as enabling a person who has separated himself from the coparcenary before the death of the deceased or any of his heirs to claim on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein.”  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Kundan Lal Gujral, he had interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property. It is only in that event that the deceased’s interest in the property would devolve by survivorship upon all the surviving members of the coparcenary, subject to the proviso to Section 6. It is not even the case of the defendant No.1 that the trademark was a coparcenary property of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral or that Late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral had constituted a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), which existed at the time of his death. Therefore, reliance placed on Section 6 is misplaced. Similarly, reliance placed on Section 19 is also misplaced as Section 19 only provides that if ‘two or more heirs’ succeeds together to the property of an intestate, they shall take the property per capita and not per stripes and would be tenants in common and not as joint tenants. In the context of the present  case, the term ‘two or more heirs’, would be plaintiffs No.1, 2 and 3 as they are the ones who were the Class-I heirs who succeeded to the property of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral in terms of Section 8. Therefore, Section 19 does not create any right in favour of defendant no.1. In this regard, reference may be made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax, Kanpur & Ors vs. Chander Sen (supra), where the Supreme Court, while approving the findings of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, observed that property which devolved on a Hindu under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act would not be a HUF property in his hand vis-a-vis his own son. Therefore, the property which devolved upon Class-I legal heirs under Section 8 will constitute absolute properties of such Class-I heirs and their sons would not have any right by birth in such properties. Therefore, defendant No.1, not being a Class-I heir would not get any interest by birth in the property of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral. In view of the above, there is no merit in the submission of the defendant that the trademarks were held in trust for him by his father as he was a minor when Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral died.",

Kundan Lal Gujral had left behind a female Class-I heir, being plaintiff no. 3, in view of the proviso to Section 6, the interest of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral in the coparcenary property would devolve by intestate succession and not by survivorship. In that event also plaintiffs No.1 to 3 would inherit the said property as tenants in common and their children would not have any right by birth in such properties. In this regard reference may be made to the  observations of the Supreme Court in Uttam vs. Saubhag (supra) which are set out below:  “20. The law, therefore, insofar as it applies to joint family property governed by the Mitakshara School, prior to the amendment of 2005, could therefore be summarised as follows:  (i)  When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, having at the time of his death an interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property will devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary (vide Section 6).  (ii)  To proposition (i), an exception is contained in Section 30 Explanation of the Act, making it clear that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, the interest of a male Hindu in Mitakshara coparcenary property is property that can be disposed of by him by will or other testamentary disposition.  (iii)  A second exception engrafted on proposition (i) is contained in the proviso to Section 6, which states that if such a male Hindu had died leaving behind a female relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class who claims through such female relative surviving him, then the interest of the deceased in the coparcenary property would devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, and not by survivorship.  (iv)  In order to determine the share of the Hindu male coparcener who is governed by Section 6 proviso, a partition is effected by operation of law immediately before his death. In this partition, all the coparceners and the male Hindu's widow get a share in the joint family property.  (v)  On the application of Section 8 of the Act, either by reason of the death of a male Hindu leaving self-acquired property or by the application of Section 6 proviso, such property would devolve only by intestacy and not survivorship.  (vi)  On a conjoint reading of Sections 4, 8 and 19 of the Act, after joint family property has been distributed in accordance with Section 8 on principles of intestacy, the joint family  property ceases to be joint family property in the hands of the various persons who have succeeded to it as they hold the property as tenants-in-common and not as joint tenants.”",

Further, since the plaintiffs No.1 to 3 continued the business of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral after his demise in 1997, they made several other applications for registration of trademarks in respect of ‘MOTI MAHAL’ and other formative marks and obtained various registrations in their name,  details of which are given in paragraph 5 of the plaint. It is also not disputed that the plaintiffs developed the business ever since the demise of late Sh. Kundan Lal Gujral and the business has expanded exponentially in the said period, which is borne out by the sales and advertisement figures filed on behalf of the plaintiffs, supported by CA certificates. Plaintiffs have claimed that from 7 restaurants alone in 1997, plaintiffs have now more than 100 restaurants owned by the company as well as franchise. Therefore, over a period of time, plaintiffs have acquired tremendous goodwill and reputation in respect of the aforesaid marks. Any unauthorised user of the aforesaid mark by defendants in respect of similar services of running restaurants/cafes and granting franchises in respect of restaurants/cafes, would cause the public to believe that the same are connected with the plaintiff.",

Vs. Rohit S. Bajaj and Ors. and the aforesaid trademarks have acquired immense good will and reputation over the years; (v) the said formative marks are capable of distinguishing goods of the petitioner with those of the others; (vi) the artistic work adopted by the respondent no.1 in the impugned copyright registration is an infringement of the petitioner’s literary and artistic copyright as the respondent no.1 has substantially reproduced in material form many aspects of the petitioner’s registered marks; (vii) the respondent no.1 has also misappropriated the words ‘Polo’ and ‘Sport’ in their entirety and the only distinguishing feature is that the respondent no.1 has added four horses with riders who are playing the game of polo, as compared to the petitioner’s mark having one horse with a rider playing polo; (viii) the work of the respondent no.1 is not an original literary/artistic work in respect of Section 13 (1) (a) of the Act; (ix) the Registry failed to act in terms of Section 45 of the Act, as a careful search of the Register of Trademarks would have clearly indicated the similarity between the petitioner’s trademarks, in respect of which the copyright also subsists in the respondents’ artistic  work; and, (x) since the work of the respondents is an unpublished copyright, no prejudice would be caused to the respondents if the said mark is removed from the Register of Copyrights.

Works in which copyright subsists.— (1) Subject to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout India in the following classes of works, that is to say,—  It is clear from a comparison of the competing marks/logos that the respondent no.1 has used four horses with riders, tilted in a manner very similar to the logo of ‘horse with a person riding it while flinging his club to hit a ball in the sport of polo’, which is a registered trademark of the petitioner. While comparing the two marks, the qualitative differences have to be examined and not the quantitative difference. So, the respondent no.1 using four horses as against the petitioner using one would not, in my mind, make a qualitative difference. Not only the horses, the respondent no.1 has also used the word marks of the petitioner i.e. SPORTS and POLO. The differences between the logo of the respondent no.1 and the trademarks of the petitioner pointed out by the counsel for the respondent no.1 are minor differences and not significant enough to make the logo, which is subject matter of the impugned copyright, an original artistic work eligible to be registered as a copyright.",

The question that arises in this case is as to whether the Respondent's impugned copyright registration is an “entry wrongly made in or remaining on the Copyright Register”. Any entry made of a work which is not an original work would be an entry wrongly made in the Register. A perusal of the Respondent's registration shows that the Respondent claims the “NIHAR UTTAM” label extracted above to be  an ‘artistic work’ published for the first time in 2002. Copyright registration can only be granted to original artistic works. Registration of copyright cannot be granted to works which are a reproduction or imitation of other original works. If any person has obtained registration of copyright of a work which is not an original work under Section 13 of the Copyright Act, such a registration or entry made in the register would be an entry wrongly made.",

Colour scheme between the two labels is the same. The manner in which the coconut tree is arranged is the same, the arrangement of two broken coconuts is similar. Due to the long user in the market, the Appellant's label was quite extensively used and hence the Respondent had access to the Appellant's label. It is the settled position in law that when two labels or artistic works are compared, the broad features are to be compared and not by putting the two labels side by side.”",

The registered trademarks of the petitioner i.e. ‘POLO SPORT’ and ‘horse with a person riding it while flinging his club to hit a ball in the sport of polo’ have been widely used in the market for a variety of products since 1967. The judgment of this Court in The Polo/Lauren Company L.P (supra) unequivocally records that the petitioner’s marks are well-known in the market and the products of the petitioner enjoy high reputation and goodwill. Additionally, the petitioner has also filed documents containing advertisements and promotional material of the petitioner along with news articles detailing the list of stores operated by the petitioner in India. The aforesaid documents clearly establish that the petitioner’s trademarks have been in the market since 1967 and owing to their popularity, have been substantially reproduced by the  respondent no.1 in its logo. The logo of the respondent no.1 which is subject matter of the impugned copyright contains the words SPORTS and POLO and the image of four horses with riders. The arrangement of the tilted horses as well as the colour scheme of the aforesaid logo leaves no doubt in my mind that the respondent no.1 has dishonestly and in bad faith copied the registered trademarks of the petitioner. The artistic works in the logo of the respondent no.1 is almost an imitation of the trademarks of the petitioner and is not an original artistic work for the purposes of registration under the Act and deserves to be expunged from the Register of Copyrights.",
