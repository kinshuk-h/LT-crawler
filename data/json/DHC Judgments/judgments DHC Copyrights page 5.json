It is stated that the said notice fails to meet the statutory requirements as follows:- a.  The notice is completely silent in relation to literary and musical works forming part of the sound recordings that are part of the plaintiff‘s copyright works.  b.  Notice does not specify the name of the channel on which there is an intent to broadcast the plaintiff‘s copyright works.  c.

The defendant paid advance royalty to the plaintiff in the manner and at the rate fixed by the IPAB for February and March 2021. The duration and territorial coverage of the intended broadcast was also mentioned in the prior notices. Hence, it is urged that there is compliance of Section 31 D of the Act. It is stressed that Section 31D of the Act dispenses with the requirement of consent from the copyright owner inasmuch as the said provision envisages a non-voluntary licensing mechanism whereby the defendant requires no authorisation or consent or license from the plaintiff to broadcast its sound recordings. It is urged that the operation of Section 31 D of the Act is instantly triggered upon the defendant giving prior notice of its  intent to broadcast its sound recordings. It is stated that the present suit of the plaintiff is only an attempt to coerce the defendant to enter into repeated lengthy, expensive and monopolistic license agreements at exorbitant royalty rates, disregarding Section 31D of the Copyright Act.",

                        "content": "Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out that six suits have been filed by the plaintiff for infringement of its copyright against six radio broadcasting companies. He has pleaded as follows:- (i)  Reliance is placed on Section 16 of the Copyright Act which provides that no person shall be entitled to copyright or otherwise than under and in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The primary method that an owner of copyright employs to exploit the copyright and to make his work available to the public is through the vehicle of voluntary license in terms of Section 30 of the Act. It is stated that there are three modes of licensing under the Copyright Act i.e. (i) voluntary licensing under Section 30, (ii) commercial licensing under Section 31 and (iii) statutory licensing under Section 31D. It is urged that in the absence of voluntary license, a defendant can broadcast sound recordings forming part of the plaintiff‘s repertoire ―subject to the provision of the Section‖ i.e. Section 31 D of the Act. Rule 29 of the Copyright Rules contains the manner prescribed for the advance notice that must be sent under Section 31D(2).  (ii)  It is strongly urged that Section 31D is an expropriatory legislation  and therefore, it requires strict compliance of statutory provisions including Rule 29 of the Rules.  (iii)  It is further urged that the Act and the Rules require an advance notice of broadcast of work much specifically stating the details provided under Rule 24 (4) in a work specific manner and the defendant has in the impugned notices completely failed to identify the plaintiff‘s works that are proposed to be broadcast under the statutory license and the defendant has failed to provide the required details in relation to such broadcast which are necessary. The notices issued by the defendant are grossly in noncompliance to the Scheme of statutory license.  (iv)  Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Saregama India Ltd. vs. Next Radio Limited & Ors., being 2021 SCC OnLine SC 817.",

                        "content": "Learned senior counsel for the defendant has strongly urged as follows:- (i)  It is urged that on account of exorbitant royalty rates coupled with monopolistic and dubious practice adopted by the plaintiff in its voluntary license arrangement, the defendant invoked the statutory license under Section 31D. It is urged that the royalty rates fixed by IPAB in its order dated 31.12.2020 for invoking statutory license are on an average approximately 60% lesser than the royalty rates set by the plaintiff in the voluntary license agreement.  (ii)  It is urged that the defendant has given prior notices of its intention to broadcast the works of the plaintiff i.e. through its advance notice dated 25.01.2021, five days in advance, for the broadcast in the month of February 2021 and through notice dated 19.02.2021 for the broadcast in  March 2021.  (iii)  It is stated that the submission of the plaintiff that notices should include minute details of every second of broadcast of sound recordings is unfounded. It is stated that the time slot, duration, amount of every second or minute can only be determined at the end of every calendar month post actual broadcast.  (iv)  Section 31 D pertains to the entirety of the defendant‘s intention to broadcast in any calendar month and the same ought not to be confused with duration of the programme under Rule 29 (4) (j).  (v)  Even in the earlier voluntary agreement with the plaintiff all the details were sent at the end of month as is apparent from a reading of the agreement.  (vi)  It is strongly urged that the present suit is a motivated suit as the plaintiff seeks to put obstructions in the implementation of Section 31 D of the Act.  (vii)  It is further urged that what the plaintiff is contending is impossible to be complied with. It is stated that a radio jockey plays songs on the basis of requests received on phone, social media, etc. and on interaction with the audience. He cannot in advance decide which song is going to be played. Then, there are updates of traffic, updates of cricket scores, etc. Songs can be changed. The medium of radio is a dynamic live interactive medium. There cannot be any straight jacket formula. Creativity/spontaneity of a radio jockey cannot be curtailed in the manner as sought by the plaintiff.  (viii)  The plaintiff only seeks to put an impediment in the operation of Section 31D of the Act.  (ix)  It is further urged that Rule 29 is directory and minor aberrations, if  any, can be no ground for the plaintiff to file the present suit.",

A Constitution Bench of this Court in In Re: Expeditious Trial of Cases Under Section 138 of NI Act 1881 has emphasized that the judiciary cannot transgress into the domain of policy making by re-writing a statute, however strong the temptations maybe. This Court observed:  ―20. Conferring power on the court by reading certain words into provisions is impermissible. A judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to enlarge nor to contract it. Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wisely suggest, construction must eschew interpolation and evisceration. He must not read in by way of creation. The Judge‘s duty is to interpret and apply the law, not to change it to meet the Judge‘s idea of what justice requires. The court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there.‖",

In the discharge of its mandate, the court may evaluate the validity of a legislation or rules made under it. A statute may be invalidated if is ultra vires constitutional guarantees or transgresses the legislative domain entrusted to the enacting legislature. Delegated legislation can, if it results in a constitutional infraction or is contrary to the ambit of the enacting statute be invalidated. However, the court in the exercise of judicial review cannot supplant the terms of the provision through judicial interpretation by re-writing statutory language. Draftsmanship is a function entrusted to the legislature. Craftsmanship on the judicial side cannot transgress into the legislative domain by re-writing the words of a statute. For then, the judicial craft enters the forbidden domain of a legislative draft. That precisely is what the Division Bench of the High Court has done by its interim order. Section 31D(2) speaks of the necessity of giving prior notice, in the manner as may be prescribed, of the intention to broadcast the work stating the duration and the territorial coverage of the broadcast, together with the payment of royalties in the manner and at the rates fixed by the Appellate Board. While the High Court has held the broadcasters down to the requirement of prior notice, it has  modified the operation of Rule 29 by stipulating that the particulars which are to be furnished in the notice may be furnished within a period of fifteen days after the broadcast. The interim order converts the second proviso into a ―routine procedure‖ instead of an exception (as the High Court has described its direction). This exercise by the High Court amounts to re-writing. Such an exercise of judicial redrafting of legislation or delegated legislation cannot be carried out.

That having been assured, we are of the view that an exercise of judicial re-writing of a statutory rule is unwarranted in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, particularly in interlocutory proceedings. The High Court was also of the view that the second proviso may be resorted to as a matter of routine, instead of as an exception and that the ex post facto reporting should be enlarged to a period of fifteen days (instead of a period of twenty four hours). Such an exercise was impermissible since it would substitute a statutory rule made in exercise of the power of delegated legislation with a new regime and provision which the High Court considers more practicable.",

It must be stated that it is a settled proposition of law that the objection to territorial jurisdiction in an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC is by way of a demurrer. This means that the objection to territorial jurisdiction has to be construed after taking all the averments in the plaint to be correct. In Exphar SA v. Eupharma Laboratories Limited : (2004) 3 SCC 688, the Supreme Court observed that when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by way of demurrer and not at the trial, the objection must proceed on the basis that the facts, as pleaded by the initiator of the impugned procedure, are true. The Supreme  Court further observed that the objection as to jurisdiction in order to succeed must demonstrate that granted those facts, the Court does not have jurisdiction as a matter of law. It is also a settled proposition of law that while considering a plaint from the standpoint of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, it is only the plaint and the documents filed along with it, that need to be seen.

Now, on the one hand we have an order of this Court granting unconditional leave to defend on the ground that a „triable issue‟ arises qua the plea of territorial jurisdiction and, on the other, we have the present application wherein the defendant seeks return of plaint without the issue being tried. This, to me, seems a somewhat incongruous situation. A „triable issue‟ means that the same requires to be decided after leading of evidence. Whereas, the parameters of disposing of an application under Order 7 Rule 10, CPC, at the initial stage without going into evidence, requires the Court to only look at the averments contained in the plaint.”",

The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant is also carrying on business of providing healthcare services, offering franchisee and know how through the impugned website www.drreddyspathlabs.com. The impugned website is an interactive one and allows for transaction to be concluded anywhere including providing a chat function on its website. The Defendant is further claiming to provide its services throughout India including within the jurisdiction of this Hon‟ble court and has also appointed various franchisee in various parts of the country and thus the same would further confer jurisdiction to the this Hon‟ble court to try and entertain the present suit.

Murali Krishna Reddy & Anr.(supra). That was a case in which the plaintiff stated that the defendants have advertised their products on their website. According to the plaintiff therein, the defendants solicit their business through use of the impugned mark “BANYAN TREE RETREAT” and the \"Banyan\" device mark in Delhi. It was alleged in that case that the defendants had presence in Delhi through their website which was accessible in Delhi. It was further stated that the website was not a passive website. It not only provided contact information but also sought feedback and inputs from its customers through an interactive web-page.  Further the plaintiff stated that the services of the defendants were being offered to the customers in Delhi because of the ubiquity, universality and utility of the features of the internet and the World Wide Web and hence, the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this court.

If they require the customer to further physically verify their quality then the mere purchase of such goods through a trap transaction may not be treated as being sufficient evidence of infringement. The facts of each case will determine whether the trap transaction is a fair one and has resulted in a purchase on the internet of goods or  services. A lone trap transaction will not be sufficient evidence of infringement or passing off. For the purposes of establishing that a part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the court, the Plaintiff would have to show that the Defendant has purposefully availed of the jurisdiction of the forum court by entering into a commercial transaction with an internet user located within the jurisdiction of the forum court. This cannot possibly be a solitary trap transaction since that would not be an instance of “purposeful” availment by the Defendant.

Baliyan vs. Vinay Kumar G.B. being 2021 SCC OnLine SC 734, decided on 15.09.2021. The Supreme Court held as follows:  ―33. It emerges from the record that the first suit was filed by the plaintiff in the month of October, 2018, bearing TM No.236 of 2018, restraining the defendant from infringing and passing off plaintiff‘s Trade Marks. That an ex-parte interim injunction was passed in favour of the plaintiff by order dated 29.10.2018. It appears having realized and found that the earlier suit was not in consonance with the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act, the plaintiff withdrew the said suit being TM No.236 of 2018 on 27.07.2019 with liberty to file a fresh suit as per the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Therefore, the second suit was filed on 31.08.2019 and within a period of thirty days from filing of the second suit the appellant herein – original plaintiff preferred the present application seeking leave of the court to file additional documents. In the application, it was specifically mentioned that so far as the invoices are concerned, the same were not in its possession at the time of the filing of the plaint and so far as the other documents are concerned they were not filed due to they being voluminous. Therefore, so far as the invoices sought to be relied on/produced as additional documents ought to have been permitted to be relied on/produced as it was specifically asserted that they were not in his possession at the time of filing of the plaint/suit.  xxx",

It is not disputed and in fact it was specifically admitted and so stated in the application that those additional documents other than the invoices were in their possession but not produced being voluminous and that the suit was filed urgently. However, it is to be noted that when the second suit was filed, it cannot be said to be urgent filing of the suit for injunction, as the first suit was filed in the month of October, 2018 and there was an ex-parte ad interim injunction vide order dated 29.10.2018 and thereafter plaintiff withdrew the said first suit on 27.07.2019 with liberty to file a fresh suit as per the Commercial Courts Act and the second suit came to be filed on 31.08.2019 after period of one month of the withdrawal of first suit. Therefore the case on behalf of the plaintiff that when the second suit was filed, it was urgently filed therefore, the additional documents sought to be relied upon other than the invoices were not filed as the same were voluminous cannot be accepted.

There was sufficient time gap between the filing of the first suit and filing of the second suit i.e. approximately 10 months and therefore when the second suit  was filed the plaintiff was having sufficient time after filing of the first suit, to file the additional documents other than the invoices at the time when the second suit was filed. Therefore as such, both the courts below have rightly not permitted the plaintiff to rely upon the documents, other than the invoices as additional documents in exercise of the powers under Order XI Rule 1 (4) read with Order XI Rule 1 (5).‖  It is clear from the above judgment that the Supreme Court did not accede to a request to allow filing of additional documents due to sufficient time gap between the filing of the first suit and the filing of the second suit i.e. approximately 10 months.

According to them, meta-tags are neither used by Google in the organic search result nor are they part of sponsored links/Ads section.  On the specific issue of meta-tags the Counsels for Google addressed the following issues:  i.  That there is neither any pleading nor any factual foundation laid down in the plaint to allege what meta-tags are or how Google is allegedly infringing the  Plaintiff’s trademark rights through meta-tags. According to them the only reference is in the prayer clause of the plaint, which is entirely unsupported by pleadings. The arguments raised regarding meta-tags have been raised for the first time in rejoinder arguments and that too only in oral submissions. It is a well settled principle that a party cannot be allowed to bring a fresh cause of action at the stage of rejoinder.  ii.  It is their argument that the plaintiff should be precluded from raising this argument at this stage. It has been their submission that meta-tags are ‘website descriptors’ or ‘tags’ that can be words, expressions or phrases that are put in the source coding of any website to help describe the contents of their website. If the website owner puts certain keywords in his website’s source coding and  designates them as met-tags, they are referred as ‘keyword meta-tags’. However ‘keyword meta-tags’ cannot be confused with ‘keywords’. A keyword is conceptually different from a meta-tag. A keyword is a word/phrase that is provided by an advertiser to act as a trigger for its ad. It is not embedded, included or incorporated into any source code or other text of either the ad or the advertiser’s website. On the other hand a meta-tag is a word /phrase put in source code by a website developer.  iii.  According to them the difference had been discussed by the Federal Court of Australia in the judgement of Veda Advantage Ltd. vs. Malouf Group Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. [2016] FCA 255, wherein it has been noted that “keyword meta-tags” were trademarked words embedded in the source code of a website and its pages by the creator/editor of the site. It had also been that unlike the ‘keywords’ employed by Google as a trigger at the backend, ‘keyword meta-tags’ were not entirely invisible  and were visible to those who know what to look for, in the source data.  iv.  They have argued that the reliance placed by the plaintiff on the judgments in the cases of People Interactive (supra) and Mattel (supra), is misplaced and  unsustainable. According to them the Courts have not in any way held a search engine responsible for use of meta-tags by a website owner in his website’s coding and are being read by the Plaintiff to suit his own case. They have argued that the aforesaid cases are inapplicable to the facts of the present case and that the plaintiff has read orders as well as concept of meta-tags to its own liking and same does not reflect the correct position of facts.",

Further, the UK Court of Appeal in the case of Reed Executive Plc & Anr. vs. Reed Business Information Ltd. and Ors., [2004] EWCA (Civ) 159 had stated in relation to use of trademarks as keywords, that an invisible use of such sort, may not be use at all, for the purpose of the trademark legislation as there is no meaning being conveyed to anyone – “no sign”. In another decision given by the Moscow City Arbitrazh (Commercial) Court in the case of Nebo vs. Almazakh, Case No. A40-128465/17-91-1116 (2017) had held  that using a trademark as a keyword does not constitute use of a trademark and observed that keywords cannot be viewed as means of using a trademark as such words do not carry the “branding” capacity. The Court had observed that keywords do not form part of the advertisement proper, they are not included  in its content and are not shown to the user. Keywords cannot even be used for identifying a particular ad as the same keywords may be used for multiple advertisements.

The High Court of New Zealand in  124 had held that use of a trademark as a keyword is an act which is not “seen” or “known” or understood by the consumer, it could thereby not be “taken as” anything, let alone amounting to use that this is “likely to be taken as being used as a trademark”. This view was also accepted by a Court of the  United States of America in the case of Merck & Co. Inc. & Anr. vs. Mediplan Health Consulting, 425 F.

In absence of any actual or visible use of a trademarked term within the text of an advertisement, no question of likelihood of confusion or deception arises. Mere triggering of an advertisement of a third party cannot per se give rise to an assumption of confusion in public. Counsels for Google have also relied on McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition to state that a computer user who sees a search engine results page and clicks on a non-deceptive advertising link resulting from a trademark keyword purchased by a competitor is not confused as to the source of affiliation of any ultimate purchase that is made from that website and after trial, almost all Courts have found no likelihood of confusion  exists.

They have also placed reliance on the case of Nebo (supra) wherein it had been observed that the use of a trademark as keyword does not create the possibility of confusing any  products of the claimant with those of the advertiser and it is merely one of the technical criteria provided by the advertiser for displaying its ad in the online advertising spaces. The Supreme Court of South Africa (Court of Appeals) in the judgements in the cases of Cochrane Steel Products (Pty) Ltd.  vs. M-Systems Group (Pty) Ltd & Anr. (227/2015) [2016] ZASCA 74 and Esquire Electronics Ltd. vs. Roopanand Bros., [1991] R.P.C. 425, had observed that it would be unnatural for a consumer to get misled by a clearly labelled ad, which clearly identifies the source. If neither the advertisement nor the advertiser’s website contains any reference to the trademark owner then consumers ought to conclude that it is not related to the trademark owner’s products or services, causing no confusion, and this was supported by absence of any evidence of actual confusion. Reliance is also placed on a judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Havells India Ltd. & Anr. vs. Amritanshu Khaitan & Ors., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 8115, to contend that advertising forms a part of commercial speech and it is an essential facet covered by Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. Moreover, counsels for Google have  stated that comparative advertisement is permissible and in the interest of public enlightenment and competition. Such use is permissible under the umbrella of fair use. Any comparison which is unfavourable to a competitor does not mean that it is dishonest or detrimental to the mark of the owner.",

Many e-commerce providers, such as FlipKart and Amazon, use registered trademarks in their backend systems to trigger offers for alternative brands and products. They have drawn an analogy to Netflix to state that even it shows alternatives to a particular title searched by a user,  presumably using that information in its backend systems as well.

This indicates that it is an integral part of “use” in advertising and in background of the instant case where the question of “use in advertising” amounting to “use” is concerned, foreign cases  cannot be relied on as the laws in India are very specific when it comes to “use in advertising” constituting “use” of a trademark.

A trademark, need not be visible which is apparent from section 29(9) wherein it is stated that infringement may occur even by spoken use. So is the case of a keyword.

                        "content": "Google relied on McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition and asserted that a computer user who seeks a  search engine results page and clicks on a non-deceptive advertising link resulting from a trademark keyword purchased by a competitor is not confused as to the source or affiliation of any ultimate purchase that is made from that website. Mr. Lall stated that even if this is taken to be true, would Google ensure  that the advertising is non-deceptive. He contends that Google has stated that it does not control the content in the advertising. He argued that this submission of Google is not relevant to the case as advertisers use a host of techniques to confuse its consumers and Google intentionally pawns well-known trademarks to such parties. According to him, as per section 29(7) there is no requirement of confusion, mere use in advertising amounts to infringement and similarly for the use in advertising, confusion is not a pre-requisite under section 29(8). The use of plaintiff’s trademark as a keyword is not authorised by the plaintiff which is a pre-requisite under section 29(7). Moreover section 29(8) has been violated since the plaintiff’s trademark is being sold as a keyword. Use by Google cannot be said to be honest use under any circumstances, especially when Google does not ensure that the overall effect is neither  misleading nor deceptive. He also stated that on the basis of the material placed on record which shows instances of actual confusion and passing off, the submissions made by Google that there is no case of passing off, is unacceptable. In contradiction Google’s argument that no case of use of a trademark or  infringement is made out under any part of section 29 of the TM Act. Mr. Lall stated that the terminology used in Section 29(7) of TM Act is “material intended to be used....for advertising goods or services” and keywords are used by Google to trigger advertisements. It is therefore admittedly a “material” intended to be used for advertising. The term “within its advertising” used in the note by Google does not exist in TM Act. It is the case of the plaintiff that there is no exception to section 29(7) for fair use; there is no fair use as evidence has been filed by the plaintiff showing actual confusion on account of mischievous advertising and that none of the assertions with regard to statutory exemption under sections 30 and 35 of the TM Act have been pleaded and there is no evidence that other e-commerce providers also use keywords in their back-end programming.",

So, it follows, what is infringement, is not merely visual representation of the product in bad light under the provision of Section 29(9) but it is infringement of the trademark if the same is caused by way of spoken use of the words and the visual representation of the said words. Furthermore, a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Kapil Wadhwa & Ors. vs. Samsung Electronics Co.

In fact, the Court also held that Section 29 (8) also makes it clear that if any advertising of a mark takes unfair advantage of the mark or is detrimental to its distinctive character even without sale taking place there is an infringement.",

The concept of meta-tags and keywords can be understood in the following manner which I have culled out from the judgments given by various High Courts of this country and also pleadings of the defendant Nos.1 and 3 which I reproduce below:  It must be stated here that the working of the meta-tags and also the keywords, as contended by Mr. Sethi is governed  through the use of algorithms. The use of meta-tags within codes and keywords with respect to the sponsored search produces a desired result which is on the basis of Google’s algorithm. According to the Oxford Reference website, algorithm has been defined as, a “documented series of steps  which leads to the transformation of some data. For example, in order to calculate the sum of a series of numbers a possible algorithm would involve repeatedly adding the numbers to be summed to a running total. Computer programs are a manifestation of algorithms which allow them to be executed very quickly”. Whereas the Collins online dictionary defines algorithm as, “a series of mathematical steps, especially in a computer program, which will give you the answer to a particular kind of problem or question”.",

It is the case of Mr. Sethi that it is the use of Google’s algorithm in the AdWord program which triggers a sponsored result i.e., the advertisements, which is  different from the use of meta-tags, which produces Google’s organic result. He stated that the sponsored result is triggered, based on many parameters, wherein each ad is given a quality score which is an aggregate of many factors such as relevancy of ad to search query, landing page quality, number of ad  extensions, past history of the advertiser, geographical relevance of Ads to the webpage user; which goes to show that the AdWords Program is not driven by monetary consideration alone. No doubt, that meta-tags and keywords may be conceptually different however, both are used to show relevancy and appear on the top of the search engine result page, whether in organic or sponsored result. The question now is whether the use of mark as a keyword, results in diversion of traffic from the website of the original proprietor to that of the advertiser, this aspect has not been disputed / contested by Google, nor it has been argued that the end result from use of meta-tags and keywords is different; inasmuch as both are instrumental for a search result (whether organic or sponsored) to appear on the top of the search engine result page, except that sponsored links to the advertiser’s web page is marked with the  symbol denoting which is followed by the URL, displayed in the following manner: .",

More help for trademark owners  There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in AdWords text ads. Along with  the factors described below, these policies apply only to trademarked terms where the owner submitted a valid complaint to Google and requested that the terms be restricted in Google ad campaigns.  Google will investigate and may restrict the use of a trademark within ad text. Ads using restricted trademarks in their ad text may not be allowed to run. This policy applies worldwide.  Exceptions: Here are some cases when the policy for ad text doesn't apply in the way described above;  •  Ad campaigns targeting Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or Ireland may use a trademark in ad text if the ad is in compliance with our policy on resellers and informational sites.  xxx  xxx xxx  •  Advertisers can use a trademarked term within ad text if they are authorized, meaning that the trademark owner sent Google the necessary form allowing an advertiser's particular account to use a certain term.  A trademark owner (or contact person listed on the trademark complaint) can provide Google with authorization to let specific AdWords accounts use the trademark in ad campaigns. Here are some important things to know about authorizations:  xxx  xxx  xxx  o  We can either prohibit all use or allow all use of a particular term by an advertiser. Therefore, we cannot accept conditional authorization requests that include a time expiration or limitations on use of the term in specific contexts.  o  The trademark owner may change or rescind authorization at any time by sending an email to ads-trademarks@google.com.  •  An ad can use a trademarked term in its text if either of these conditions is true: o the ad text uses the term descriptively in its ordinary meaning rather than in reference to the trademark o the ad is not in reference to the goods or services corresponding to the trademarked term  For ad campaigns targeting the European Union and EFTA regions, the ad text policy above applies. Therefore, we do not prevent the selection of trademarks as keywords in the EU and EFTA. However, in response to a complaint, we will do a limited investigation as to whether a keyword (in combination with particular ad text) is confusing as to the origin of the advertised goods and services.  In response to a complaint, we will do a limited investigation to see whether the use of a trademarked term as a keyword in combination with particular ad text is confusing as to the origin of the advertised goods and services (such as a keyword and ad that falsely imply affiliation with the trademark owner). If the combination of a keyword and ad text is confusing, we will disapprove the specific ad mentioned in the complaint so that it can't run.  Under our EU and EFTA policy, the following types of ads may use a trademark as a keyword, provided that the combination of the keyword and ad is not confusing (as described above). The following are examples, and not an exhaustive list;  •  Ads using a trademarked term when that term is being used in its ordinary meaning rather than in reference to the trademark  •  Ads for competing products or services  •  Ads for resale of the trademarked goods or service  •  Ads for the sale of components, replacement parts, or compatible products corresponding to a trademark  •  Ads for informational sites about a product or service corresponding to the trademark  - List of affected regions  •  Glorioso Islands  Google will not investigate or restrict the use of trademark terms in keywords, even if a trademark complaint is received.  The trademark policies described here apply only to the use of trademarks in Google AdWords text ads.  See information about our policy on the use of trademarks in these areas:  As described in the section above, Google can investigate and may restrict the use of trademarks in ad text. This process does not apply to trademarks used in an ad's display URL (the website address shown in green within an ad).  Google will not investigate and restrict use of the trademark in display URLs because the presence of trademarked term within a URL may not necessarily constitute trademark use, such as in the case of post-domain paths or subdomains. Trademark owners can contact the advertiser directly regarding any concerns about display URLs. Please understand that Google is not in a position to be the arbiter of third-party disputes. Additionally, if the domain name contains or is similar to a trademark, but is actually owned by the advertiser, the trademark owner is the appropriate party to handle the matter, such as through the Uniform Domain Resolution Process (UDRP).  The trademark policies described here apply only to the use of trademarks in Google AdWords text ads. These ads are clearly marked as \"Ads\" on Google search results pages and as \"Ads by Google\" on our Display Network. Other types of trademark complaints, like trademarks used in sites that appear in Google search results, are not covered under our investigation process.

Our AdWords Terms and Conditions with advertisers prohibits intellectual property infringement by advertisers. Advertisers are responsible for the keywords they choose to generate advertisements and the text that they choose to use in those advertisements. Google takes allegations of trademark infringement very seriously and as a courtesy we investigate matters raised by trademark owners. Trademarks are territorial and apply only to certain goods or services. Therefore, different parties can own the same mark in different countries or different industries. Accordingly, in processing complaints, Google will ask the trademark owner for information regarding where the mark is valid and for what goods or services. Please note the following about our complaint process:  •  The trademark owner doesn’t need to be a Google AdWords advertiser in order to send a complaint.  •  Any such investigation will only affect ads served on or by Google.  •  Google’s trademark policy does not apply to search results. Our investigations only apply to sponsored links. For trademark concerns about websites that appear in Google search results,  the trademark owner should contact the site owner directly. xxx xxx xxx  •  Because Google is not a third-party arbiter, we encourage trademark owners to resolve their disputes directly with the advertisers, particularly because the advertisers may have similar ads running via other advertising programs.  o  In the U.S., we allow some ads to show with a trademark in ad text if the ad is from a reseller or from an international site. However, if our investigation finds that the advertiser is using the trademark in the ad text in a manner which is competitive, critical or negative, we will require the advertiser to remove the trademark and prevent them from using it in similar ad test in the future. Learn more about our U.S. trademark policy.   o  Outside the US. If our investigation finds that the advertiser is using the trademark in ad text, we will require the advertiser to remove the trademark and prevent the, from using it in ad text in the future.  o  Google is dedicated to providing relevant advertising to our users, advertisers and publishers alike. Accordingly, our trademark policy not to investigate the use of trademarks as keywords in the regions listed above aims to provide users with choices relevant to their keywords. At the same time, we investigate trademark violations in ad text, both as a courtesy to the trademark owner and to ensure that the ads are clear to users.  •  In certain regions, we may investigate use of trademarks in ad text, in keywords, or in both ad text and keywords.  Regions in which we investigate use in both ad text and  Åland  Ashmore and  Cartier Islands  Australia  Austria  Bassas da-India  Belgium  Bouvet Island  Brazil  Bulgaria  China  Guadeloupe  McDonald Islands  Guernsey Heard Island and Hong Kong Hungary Iceland Isle of Man Italy  Jan Mayen  Liechtenstein  Saint Martin  Saint Pierre  and Miquelon  Slovakia  Slovenia  South Korea  Spain  Svalbard  Sweden  Switzerland  Wallis  and Futuna  Greece  o  When we receive a complaint from a trademark owner, our review is limited to ensuring that the advertisements at issue are not using a term corresponding to the trademarked term in the ad text or as a keyword. If they are, we will require the advertiser to remove the trademarked term from the ad text or keyword list and will prevent the advertiser from using the trademarked term in the future. Any such investigation will only affect ads served on or by Google.  o  We do not take any action in situations where an advertisement is being triggered by non-trademark terms even though the search query contains a trademarked terms. This occurrence stems from the fact that google allows advertisers to use a broad matching system to target their ads. For example, if an advertiser has selected the keyword “shoes” that advertiser’s ad will appear when a user enters the word “shoes” as a search query, regardless of other search terms that may be used. So, the ad would show if the user entered any of the following search queries: “tennis shoes”, “red shoes” or “Nike shoes.” This system eliminates the need for the advertiser to specify each of the myriad different search query combinations that are relevant to the ad.  Trademark owners may submit either a specific or general trademark complaint. A specific complaint means that we will investigate a trademark term(s) in specific advertisements only. The trademark owner is required to provide the exact URLs in  question and we will not investigate the trademark in any other advertisements. A general complaint means that we will investigate in all relevant advertisements. The trademark owner does not need to provide the specific URLs in question. However, if there are specific advertisers that are authorized to use the trademark(s), the trademark owner is required to provide the corresponding customer ID(s) or login email(s).  If you have concerns about the use of your trademark in AdWords ads or keywords showing in a region listed above, file a trademark complaint. If your complaint concerns use of your trademark in multiple regions, please send us one complaint with ownership information for your trademark in these regions. We’ll follow the appropriate procedure for each regions submitted in your complaint.  I have previously filed a trademark complaint, but now I want to allow an advertiser use my trademark. What is Google’s trademark authorization policy?  If we have processed a complaint for a trademark advertisers using the mark in the regions and industry of the trademark owner will have their keywords and / or ad text disapproved according to the process outline above.  xxx  xxx  xxx  ……….. We are only able to prohibit or allow all use of a particular term by an advertiser. Trademark owners may revoke the authorization at any time.  xxx  xxx  xxx  Google AdWords prohibits the sale or promotion of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical with or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or another. Counterfeiters attempt to deceive consumers into believing the counterfeit is a genuine product of the brand owner or sell the goods as faux, replicas, imitations or clones of the original product. Counterfeit goods differ from  standard trademark infringement in that counterfeiters attempt to pass off their goods as the originals instead of merely using a similar mark in a confusing manner. Counterfeit goods differ from pirated products or copyright infringement because it is the trademark that is copied, rather than software, books, artwork, etc.  We will investigate all reasonable complaints: our actions may include disapproving or disabling ads and / or terminating advertisers. Any such investigation and action will only affect ads served on or by Google.  Please note, that upon request and approval, a complainant’s contact details may be forwarded to the affected advertiser(s). If you have concerns about the sale of counterfeit goods in AdWords ads, please file a complaint. Note: this information is only available in English.

As per the Annexure-3 of the affidavit dated March 16, 2015 the change in the AdWords trademark policy was brought about in the year 2015, wherein Google has changed the policy to mean that they shall “not investigate or restrict the use trademark terms in keyword”. It appears, the same is for the reason already stated above under the submissions of Mr.Sethi  i.e., the use of trademark as keywords does not imply “use”. I may also state here that as per Google’s policy they investigate use of the trademark as a keyword but i.e., only confined for the EU. This is in addition to the investigation undertaken for an infringement of trademark in Ad-title and Ad-text. From the  above, it is clear that the fact that Google is investigating an Ad where use of trademark as a keyword is being used, there cannot be any reason why such a procedure is not followed in India. It appears this stipulation has been incorporated in their policy with regard to EU countries for the reason that there might be a chance of deception / confusion in a given Ad which pops-up on the basis of search query which has also been chosen as a keyword, which may trigger the advertisement consisting of the infringed trademark / references to it.",

Over 300 branches all over India. Providing services of domestic shifting, international moving, car transportation and corporate moving.  A case where use of trademark as a keyword triggering a sponsored result does not depict a product or services of that Ad in a pictorial form and the consumer does not have the aid of reference to the device marks/logo and colour combinations associated with the mark. The average consumer has to rely upon the words alone which form the Ad-content i.e., Ad-text, Ad-title and URL which may not directly represent a trademark, rather the words comprising of a trademark which may be strewn with generic words but, on a totality, reading the Ad-content the average consumer is deceived to form an opinion that the product or the services reflected in the Ad-content is the same which he is looking for. If a consumer were to search for a hypothetical company by the name of “Beetroute Transport” the search engine result page may return the following hypothetical sponsored links in seriatim:  A.1. www.beetroute.com Transport services | Best in India Awarded best transporters award for the year 2019.

However, the Ads appearing at ‘A.1’ and ‘A.2’ with its combined use of parts of a mark and its variants in URL along with Ad-title may cause confusion in the minds of the average consumer, ride on the original owner’s goodwill and still not be investigated by Google as it would be deemed to  be policy compliant according to them. This advertisement though not in violation of Google’s AdWords Policy may still cause confusion in the minds of the average consumer.

It is Google’s case that it does not investigate use of a trademarked term in the URL, i.e., Google restricts its investigation to Ad-text and Ad-title. Whereas it is trite law that use of trademarks in URLs or deceptively similar  terms would amount to passing off [Ref: Satyam Infoway Ltd.  vs. Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC 145]. This I say so, because any Ad-content consisting of Ad-title, Ad-text and URL which is likely to deceive or cause confusion to an average person with imperfect recollection [Ref: Amritdhara  Pharmacy vs. Satyadeo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449], in the context of India shall constitute infringement of trademark or passing off. A defence may be taken that the trademark of the plaintiff does not feature in the said advertisement. This defence may sound appealing at a first blush however, it can be seen from such advertisement that using the written part / words of a trademark an attempt is sought to be made to take advantage of the trademark owner’s goodwill. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, held as under:  “19. With respect, we are unable to agree that the principle of phonetic similarity has to be jettisoned when the manner in which the competing words are written is different and the conclusion so arrived at is clearly contrary to the binding precedent of this Court in Amritdhara case [AIR 1963 SC 449] where the phonetic similarity was applied by judging the  two competing marks. Similarly, in Durga Dutt Sharma case [AIR 1965 SC 980] it was observed that:  “In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiffs and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated.”",

                        "content": "Lastly, in Dyechem case [(2000) 5 SCC 573] it was observed in para 54 as under  “54. As to scope of a buyer being deceived, in a passing-off action, the following principles have to be borne in mind. Lord Romer, L.J. has said in Payton & Co. v. Snelling, Lampard & Co. [(1900) 17 RPC 48] that it is a misconception to refer to the confusion that can be created upon an ignorant customer. The kind of customer that the courts ought to think of in these cases is the customer who knows the distinguishing characteristics of the plaintiff's goods, those characteristics which distinguish his goods from other goods in the  market so far as relates to general characteristics. If he does not know that, he is not a customer whose views can properly be regarded by the Court. (See the cases quoted in National Sewing Thread & Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd. [AIR 1948 Mad 481] which was a passing-off action.) In Schweppes case [Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbens, (1905) 22 RPC 601 (HL)] Lord Halsbury said, if a person is so careless that he does not look and does not treat the label fairly but takes the bottle without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written very plainly indeed up the face of the label, you cannot say he is deceived.”  These observations appear to us to be contrary to the decision of this Court in Amritdhara case [AIR 1963 SC 449] where it was observed that the products will be purchased by both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate and the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. A trade may relate to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons. The purchaser in India cannot be equated with a purchaser of goods in England. While we agree that in trade mark matters, it is necessary to go into the  question of comparable strength, the decision on merits in Dyechem case [(2000) 5 SCC 573] does not, in our opinion, lay down correct law and we hold accordingly.”  (emphasis supplied)  Then in such a case allowing individuals who are not owners of a trademark to choose a keyword which is a trademarked term or use parts of the trademark interspersed with generic words in the Ad-title and / or Ad-text may constitute an infringement of a trademark and / or passing off. It is for this reason, reliance on foreign jurisprudence may be misplaced as the European Courts have held the average consumer to be normally informed and reasonably attentive [Ref: Google France SARL (supra)]. It is unclear that on what basis has a distinction been drawn by Google between certain countries with regard to the trademark policies so formulated and followed. Be that as it may, it is clear from Google’s EU and EFTA policy that Google provides a higher duty of care in a jurisdiction where large portions of the population are internet literate. This aspect further fortifies my finding as to why such a policy should be followed in India. Mr. Lall is right in relying on the judgment of Baker Hughes Ltd. & Ors. (supra) to state  that even sophisticated consumers can be confused and the affidavit filed by Mr. Gaurav Bakshi dated October 27, 2015 supports the proposition advanced by Mr. Lall.",

Suffice to state, if the keyword is not a trademark then there cannot be a question of infringement or passing off of the trademark. However, it is a conceded position that an advertiser can provide a keyword which is not part of the keyword planner tool only goes to show that in such a case registered trademarks including well known trademarks should be accorded a higher  degree of protection by Google through its policies so as to ensure that the goodwill of the marks is safeguarded. In a situation where these safeguards are not in place the trademark owner must enter the Google AdWords program in order to protect its own goodwill, which is the case of the plaintiff as  well.",

The advertiser would want his own Ad to appear on top of the sponsored results list in order to gain maximum publicity. Even though, the keyword planner tool may not be mandatory but if not used by an advertiser, may result in poorer quality score of the Ad thereby reducing the chances for the Ad to appear in the sponsored result list. Resultantly, it may be stated that the same though not mandatory has become essential for an advertiser. It was also  the plea of Mr. Sethi that trademarks are even permitted in ad-text by resellers, informational sites and authorized advertisers and as such may not constitute an infringement. This plea of Mr. Sethi is not vehemently opposed by Mr. Lall in his rejoinder submission while countering the reliance placed by  Mr. Sethi on the Judgment of Merck & Co.

The  advertisement not featuring a trademark and using trademark as a keyword even if not infringing Google’s policies creates confusion as to the origin of goods and services, the keyword along with the overall effect of the advertisement, (including Ad-title, Ad-text and URL) needs to be investigated in terms of  paragraph 96 above.",

In the absence of parties which have bid for the trademark of the plaintiff and any statement on record to that effect that the entities so named by Mr. Sethi have bid upon the trademark of the plaintiff as a keyword, they are not a necessary party. Hence to that extent, there is no cause of  action for the plaintiff against those entities to be made parties in this suit.

The Madras High Court also looked into the generic / descriptive nature of the words appearing in the Ad-text and Ad-title, which is not the case here. It is the stand taken by Google and so submitted by Mr. Sethi that the current Google policy states that “Google does not allow any third party to put  / publish / refer to a Trademark of an owner in the Adtext / Adtitle as per its policy”. Since this statement has already been taken on record that the Trademarks of the plaintiff shall not appear in the Adtext and Adtitle, the factual situation has departed from what was the issue before the Madras High  Court. I may also state that the appearance of the sponsored links was different from what it is today, i.e., earlier (at the time of Consim I and Consim II) the sponsored links appeared on the search engine results page with a yellow / blue background. The issue that whether these ads appeared on the top of the organic search results or on the right-hand side of the organic search results; Mr. Lall states that the former was the scenario, whereas the counsels for Google have pointed to the policy as existing then to state that the sponsored results could have also appeared on top of the search engine results page.

Even in the instant case, it is unclear as to how exactly a sponsored link is given the first rank and placed on top of the sponsored search results, over above the organic search results  i.e., it is unclear whether some components as listed out by Mr. Sethi being; bid amount, quality of landing page, relevancy of ads etc. are given more weightage than others. It has also not been explained by the defendants the functioning of their current policy (as available online) which also incorporates a broad search and negative search option [Ref. Paragraph 50 expert witness testimony in judgment of Intercity Group (NZ) (supra)]. Since, it is Google’s proprietary algorithm, which controls not only the ranking, place of appearance and review of ads, this issue would have to be looked into at the time of trial. It is clear from the current Trademark policy of Google that it can “either prohibit all use or allow all use of a particular term by an advertiser” and despite such prohibition on use of a Trademark term in Adtext and Adtitle, there are possibilities of passing off. In Consim II it had been clearly stated by the  Madras High Court that it is clear that the search engine has control over selection of keywords by an advertiser but the search engine may not be aware of all the registered trademarks in various jurisdictions and in respect of various goods and services. I am in agreement with this observation and state that  once the search engine has been made aware of a registered Trademark in a certain jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon the search engine to exercise a higher duty of care to ensure protection of the goodwill attached to such Trademark. Especially in light of the Judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of DRS Logistics (P) Ltd. vs. Rajesh Agarwal & Ors., 2013 SCC Online Del 1299 wherein the mark of the plaintiff in paragraph 15 has been declared as a well-known trademark.",

They can be located by someone who knows what to look for, whereas trademarked as keywords are invisible to the consumer; and they are not used as a trademark and their invisible use shall not amount to infringement, nor does a  keyword denote connection in trade between the advertiser and the trademark owner. Keywords are also not being used to distinguish the service of one trader from another.

I have also held above that even invisible use of a trademark would constitute “use” within the meaning of the provisions of the TM Act. That part, I have also held that the result of use of meta-tags and keywords is not different as both are instrumental for a search result to appear on the top of the search engine result page except that the sponsored links to the advertisers’ web page is marked with the symbol denoting “Ad”, which is followed by the URL. So, the keyword even assuming is invisible, the effect it has for advertising is that the traffic of the website of the trademark owner is diverted to that of the advertiser which shall have the  effect of passing off of the goods and services of the trademark owner as that of the advertiser.",

Even on the facts, this case can be differentiated since in that case the advertiser was providing services which were ancillary to the trademark owner. In other words, the trademark owner was providing financial services related to credit rating whereas the advertiser conducted a business assisting the consumers with poor credit rating and rectifying errors in the credit reports given by the proprietor of the trademark. Furthermore, it was stated that an ordinary and reasonable consumer in the context of Australia would not get confused between the organic search result and the sponsored search result, which appears within a yellow ad box. Even in that case the Court has stated in paragraphs 253 and 263 that certain words in the Adtext including the single word trademark of the owner which was  visible, suffixed with generic words was likely to cause confusion.

I may state here, Mr. Lall by drawing my attention to paragraph 140 of the judgement has stated that the Court has  clearly stated that use as a reserved word can be regarded as use in course of trade, the Court has not expressed its opinion.

Suffice to state the judgment is distinguishable on facts inasmuch as the Court held that the students who are concerned with the Ads had to exercise higher duty of care while distinguishing ads from the organic search result and secondly the sponsored result which was appearing in a yellow shaded  box was sufficient to distinguish the website of the parties and the parties before the Court were the advertiser / owner and not Google or YAHOO or any search engine. In Chocolat Lamontagne (supra), the submission of Mr. Sethi was, keyword advertising is not different from accepted market  practice. In this case too the search results appearing which were in French in the sponsored results were clearly distinguishable as the hyperlinks listed under the heading sponsored links were preceded by the phrase ‘Alternative to Lamontagne chocolate and other products’ Similar is the position in so far as the judgment relied upon by Mr. Sethi in the case of Vancouver Community College (supra). The Courts of Canada have also proceeded in terms of Canadian laws on the subject and also on a premise that the average consumer is internet literate and can differentiate sponsored results from organic results. The Court in this case however, made certain findings which may be noted such as in paragraph 55, the aspect of confusion is to be determined on the search engine result page and the Court came to a conclusion in that case, the components of the tort of passing off were met.  Therefore, one cannot overlook the fact that there is a possibility of confusion even in cases where the consumers are aware of the functioning of search engines. These judgments do not act as a bulwark for the case as presented by the counsels for Google.",

(supra) is concerned, similar would be my conclusion as concluded by me in the case of Google France SARL (supra), inasmuch as the issue before the European Court of Justice was to an extent similar to that in the present case, wherein the trademark owner had agitated that third parties had been using the trademark of the owner as the keyword in order to feature prominently on the search engine results page. However, the Court had examined this issue in the context of the average consumer in Europe and the European Laws / Directives wherein in the Court primarily examined the adverse impact of use of such mark on functions of a trademark. However, there was a caveat that even in such a scenario the  Court had remarked in paragraph 83 that whether the function of a trademark is adversely affected would depend on a particular manner in which the Ad is presented and such presentation does not enable the average consumer therein to ascertain the origin of goods and services. The Court further  went on to note that in cases where the Ad does not suggest an economic link but remains vague to the origin of goods and services and the internet consumer is unable to determine on the basis of the advertising link and commercial message attached thereto whether the advertiser is a third party with regard to the proprietor of the trademark or not, or economically related to it, or is a third-party, the Court held that the conclusion must be that there is an adverse effect on the function of the trademark. This question, the European Court of Justice left open for the National Courts to assess on a case-by-case basis and even the role played by the service provider whether neutral or not is to be assessed by the National Courts. To this extent I am in agreement with the findings in Google France SARL (supra). The question of neutrality of the service provider in this case being Google would be subject matter of trial. A Coordinate  Bench of this Court in Christian Louboutin (supra), while answering the questions related to meta-tagging vis-à-vis intermediaries held as under:  “82. In the world of e-commerce, IP owners face challenging times. This is because sellers of counterfeit or infringing products seek shelter behind the platform's legitimacy, like in the case of Darveys com. Darveys com is involved in the promotion and sale of luxury products. The seller is located on a foreign shore. It is not even clear as to whether the seller is in fact selling a genuine product. As stated above, Darveys com promotes the products to its members who sign up on Darveys com. Without becoming a member, one cannot effect a purchase on Darveys com. In such cases giving exemptions of Section 79 would in fact amount to legalizing the infringing activity. The seller is not known, the person from whom the seller purchases the goods is not known. It is also not known if the product is genuine, though Darveys com represents to be same to be genuine. In view of these factors, Darveys com cannot be termed as an intermediary that is entitled to protection under Section 79 of the IT Act. The use of the mark, Christian Louboutin, the name, the photograph of the founder, without the permission of the Plaintiff, and without ensuring  that the products which are sold are in fact genuine, would constitute violation of Plaintiff's rights. The Defendant has relied on a judgement of a Ld. Single Judge in Christian Louboutin v. Abubacker, 250 (2018) DLT 475 the court was considering protection for the red sole trademark. In the said judgement the court held that the red sole mark is not distinctive as there can be no monopoly on the colour red. The present suit does not relate to the red sole mark in isolation but the use of the plaintiffs marks, name of its name of its founder, use of the words constituting the mark in various ways including on the website, images, packaging material, invoice etc. by the Defendant which is an e-commerce platform. Thus the said judgement does not help the Defendant in the present case.",

The Plaintiff claims that when a web user enters the Plaintiffs mark in a search engine such as Google, Darveys com website is amongst the search results and an analysis of the code shows that the marks of the Plaintiff are used as meta-keyword-tags, with a view to increasing the hits which the Defendant's website obtains from search engines like Google.",

The  Court had considered three scenarios for a possibility of confusion, out of which only the first and second scenarios are of interest. The first and second scenario pertained to sponsored links on intermediary websites wherein a consumer would be able to see the trademark in the advertisement and in the other where the consumer cannot see the trademark term in the advertisement. In the case of the former it was held to be detrimental to the function of a trademark and in the latter, it was stated that the consumers would be aware of appearances of sponsored links. Whether this awareness exists in this country is unclear and would be subject to Trial especially so when there are chances of the advertisements of the trademark owner often appearing in the sponsored results with blurred lines of distinction between sponsored results and organic results in a case where an average Indian consumer has specifically typed a  trademarked term. The third scenario concerned the layout of Amazon website and the appearances of the trademark therein that too when there was no overt statement that Amazon did not sell the products of the trademark owner, which is not a question for consideration before this Court.",

Even in Intercity Group (NZ) (supra), the average consumer has been taken to be well-informed and reasonably observant but even so the Court has observed that there may exist a possibility of confusion as the case before the New Zealand Court was that the advertiser had bid on the  trademark as keyword being InterCity, which appeared on the search engine results page along with the website of the advertiser. In NZ Fintech (supra), the plaintiff therein had alleged that the defendant therein was using its mark “MOOLA” as a keyword. Whether such use resulted in  sufficient number of consumers perceiving such use by the defendant therein to be a use of the trademark, was to be a matter of trial. These judgments therefore are distinguishable on facts. However, the New Zealand Court too in both the aforementioned judgments had interpretated their own law to mean that the use of trademark as a keyword, amounts to use in the course of trade.

In cases of intellectual property, the Courts must also be mindful of the fact that it is ultimately the public at large which gets cheated and feels the brunt of spurious goods and services in the market [Ref: Hindustan Pencils (P) Ltd. vs. India Stationery Products Co. & Ors., AIR 1990 Delhi 19].",
