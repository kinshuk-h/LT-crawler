The tender submitted by New Horizons Ltd. (for short “NHL”) was not accepted by the Tender Evaluation Committee, apparently, on the basis of the fact that the successful party had more technical experience than any one of the constituent companies of NHL. Aggrieved by the said decision, NHL filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court against the decision of the Department of Telecommunications. The said writ petition was dismissed rejecting the plea of NHL that the technical  experience of the constituents of the joint venture was liable to be treated as that of the joint venture.

It was observed that a joint venture could take the form of a corporation wherein two or more persons or companies might join together.

Highlighting the concept of joint venture, the Court observed thus: (New Horizons case [(1995) 1 SCC 478] , SCC pp. 493-94, para 24)  “24. The expression „joint venture‟ is more frequently used in the United States. It connotes a legal entity in the nature of a partnership engaged in the joint undertaking of a particular transaction for mutual profit or an association of persons or companies jointly undertaking some commercial enterprise wherein all contribute assets and share risks. It requires a community of interest in the performance of the subject-matter, a right to direct and govern the policy in connection therewith, and  duty, which may be altered by agreement, to share both in profit and losses. (Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edn., p. 839.) According to Words and Phrases, Permanent Edn., a joint venture is an association of two or more persons to carry out a single business enterprise for profit (p. 117, Vol. 23). A joint venture can take the form of a corporation wherein two or more persons or companies may join together. A „joint venture corporation‟ has been defined as a corporation which has joined with other individuals or corporations within the corporate framework in some specific undertaking commonly found in oil, chemicals, electronic, atomic fields.

In that view of the matter, the next question for consideration is: whether being a legal entity i.e. a juridical person, the joint venture is also a “person” for the purpose of Condition 38 of the exemption notification, stipulating that the goods should be imported by “a person” who had been awarded a contract for construction of goods in India by NHAI?",

Neither was it the case of the appellant either before the adjudicating authority or before the appellate authority or before us, nor is it suggested by the documents viz. the supply order or the bill of entry, that the import of the machine was by or on behalf of the joint venture. On the contrary, the Tribunal has recorded in its order that when questioned, the learned counsel for the appellant clarified that the correspondence with the supplier of goods and placement of order had been done by Gammon and not by the joint venture or on their behalf.

(ii)  That the petitioner is one of the directors of the holding company of Amrapali Group of companies M/s Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. with the meagre shareholding of 3.2% with no executive powers and was not a part of the day-to-day management and the affairs of the company. The petitioner was part of the team, looking after the construction activities of the projects. It is further claimed that the petitioner became the Director only on 05.07.2013 and remained till 20.12.2016. Further, M/s Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. which is the holding company of Amrapali Group of Companies delivered housing projects undertaken by them on time such as Amrapali Village, Amrapali Castle, Amrapali Royal etc.  (iii)  Some of the subsequent projects including the project involving the present FIR could not be completed due to some challenges/problems but  there was no fraudulent intention in this regard since about 100% and 70% of the respective phases were completed.  (iv)  The assets of the company including the directors have already been attached after the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India ordered a forensic audit vide order dated 23.07.2019 in WP(C) no. 940 of 2017 titled Bikram Chaterji versus Union of India and Ors. The petitioner and two other directors namely Anil Sharma and Shiv Priya have been arrested in the present FIR and five other FIRs and investigation is complete in all the matters. Reference is also made to the various FIRs which stand registered against the petitioner and it is claimed that in substantial number of FIRs, the petitioner has been granted bail/anticipatory bail. It is urged that each case needs to be seen in the light of the construction undertaken in the respective projects.  (v)  The petitioner is stated to have been made authorized signatory along with others in Amrapali Dream Valley Pvt. Ltd. in terms of the board resolution of the company with a mandate to act in terms of the instructions given and had no role to play beyond the authorization and limits. It is further submitted that the petitioner was not a Director in Amrapali Dream Valley Pvt. Ltd. when the complainant booked his flat and was a Director merely for the period from 05.07.2013 to 20.12.2016.  (vi)  Reliance is also placed upon the following judgments in support of the contentions:- (a)  Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Anr. in Special Leave Petition (Crl.)

At the outset, it may be observed that more than 450 victims await for the possession of the housing units, which were agreed to be delivered within a period of 36 months along with an additional grace period of 6 months since 2014 to 2016. It is important to keep in perspective as to the reasons for the non-construction/development activities not being undertaken at the project sites to evaluate the role of the petitioner despite approval of the building plans by the competent authority in 2011 and approval of revised layout plan in 2014. Mere partial completion of the projects cannot absolve the functionaries as it cannot be ignored that the site was ultimately abandoned on account of illegal diversion of funds, which were required to be used for the purpose of completion of projects. The period during which the alleged diversion of funds was made includes the period during which the petitioner was a Director, leaving the innocent buyers in lurch. Merely because the petitioner may not have been a Director at the relevant time when the bookings were made, as claimed, does not absolve the petitioner of his responsibility as the funds were diverted with his active role and were  within his knowledge. The fact that the accused has been in custody since 26.04.2019 and the trial is likely to take some time cannot be the sole governing factors for releasing the accused on bail, at this stage.  It has been pointed out by the learned APP for the State that as per the forensic audit, the petitioner had been a Director in the company and had held the shares since 07.04.2003. Further, the petitioner was the authorized signatory in the present company as well as in the subsidiary companies in which the funds were siphoned off by way of short term loans and advances. The petitioner in the light of the evidence on record cannot claim that he was unaware of the transactions and was not responsible for the affairs of the company at the relevant time and, as such, it does not appear to be a case of vicarious liability, as claimed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Learned APP for the State has also pointed out that though only a part of the forensic audit has been referred by the learned counsel for the petitioner to claim that the petitioner was responsible for only construction and coordination but it has been concealed that the forensic audit states that the petitioner received funds from Amrapali Group of Companies, which were used for acquiring personal properties.",

However, it has been held in Nimagadda Prasad Vs. CBI (2013) 7 SCC 466, that economic offences constitute a class apart which need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The relevant observations may be quoted as under:- \"Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The economic offence having deep rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public  funds needs to be viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country.\"  Also, the observations in State of Gujarat Vs. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal & Others (1987) 2 SCC 364 are apt to be noticed:- “5. The entire community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community. A disregard for the interest of the community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even-handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white collar crimes with a permissive eve unmindful of the damage done to the national economy and national interest.”",

The petitioner  No. 1 and petitioner No. 2 are Secretary and President of Raj Laxmi Cooperative Group Housing Society (in short ‘the Society’). The gravamen of the allegation is that in the year 1990, through a friend of the complainant, the petitioners were introduced to the complainant at his office at Sena Bhawan as the Office Bearers of the concerned Society. It is alleged that the complainant, his sister-in-law and brother-in-law deposited a sum of Rs.5.0 Lakh in total with the petitioners in the name of the Society on the false assurance of providing built-up houses/flats. Respondent No. 2/complainant further states that after the year 1990, he was posted out of Delhi and when he came back to Delhi, he enquired about the status of the flat and he was informed that there were certain technical problems with the project and the petitioners agreed to return the money invested by issuing cheques. Certain cheques were also given and it is stated that on presentation, the cheques were bounced. After 1999, again when he came back to Delhi, after completion of his tenure in Kashmir Valley, he enquired about the status of flat in question and he was assured that they were in the process of allotting the houses and the same would be done very soon. It is also stated that in the year 2001, respondent No.2/complainant suffered a serious heart attack and later in the year 2003, he suffered from a stroke and has remained under medical treatment since then.

Mere statement that the complainant was being assured can hardly be taken as a sufficient explanation for such a huge delay. The duty of the Magistrate in a complaint case set out under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. is to find whether there is any matter which calls for investigation by a criminal court. It is also to find out whether there exists any valid foundation for issuance of process against the accused persons in the complaint or as to whether it is baseless one, on which no action is required to be taken. The law imposes a serious responsibility on the Magistrate to decide if there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Existence of a prima facie case, whether the prosecution of the case is an abuse of the process of the court or whether a civil dispute has been given colour of criminal dispute etc. are factors to be considered by the Magistrate while conducting/holding enquiry under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. No doubt, the enquiry at that stage of issuance of process does not partake the character of a full dress trial which can only take place after process is issued under Section 204 of the Cr.P.C. while calling upon the accused to answer the accusation made against him for adjudging the guilt of the accused person. Further, the question whether the evidence is adequate for supporting the conviction can be determined only at the trial and not at the stage of enquiry  contemplated under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. It is true that in coming to a decision as to whether the process should be issued, the Magistrate can take into consideration inherent improbabilities appearing on the face of the complaint or in the evidence lead by the complainant in support of the allegations but there appears to be a very thin line of demarcation between a probability of conviction of the accused and establishment of a prima facie case against him.",

But the accused persons have not provided the same. There are no steps stated to have been taken either for recovery of the money or any action against the petitioners/accused by the complainant/respondent No.2 after depositing the money, once he realized that he has been cheated. According to the complainant itself, he had come to know in the year  1999  that the flats were not constructed. Respondent No.2/complainant has not claimed any refund in pursuance to notice published by Mr. Balram Barera, who was appointed by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, in Times of India dated 14.05.2000. The complaint in question has been filed only on 15.01.2010. On the basis of the aforesaid facts, it can be concluded that the complainant/respondent No.2 and his family members invested a sum of Rs.5.0 Lakh with the petitioners/accused with the hope of allotment of a flat in the Society. The registration of FIR against the petitioners, appointment of Administrator by this court and return of the money to some of the investors clearly shows that respondent No.2/complainant could have resorted to any of the options available to him but he did not take any action in the last 20 years after depositing the money. It is seen that only with an object to recover the money, which he could not get it as he had missed the opportunity before the Administrator, he filed the instant complaint to give a criminal colour to the entire episode.",

Bishnu Kumar Surekha7 , has held that unless the complaint shows that the accused had dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time the complainant parted with the money, it would not amount to offence under Section 420 of the I.P.C. and it may only amount to breach of contract. A guilty intention is essential ingredient of the offence of cheating. In Mahadeo Prasad v. State of West Bengal8 , it has been held that where the charge against the accused under Section  420  of the IPC is that he induced the complainant to part with his goods, on the understanding that the accused would pay for the same on delivery but did not pay, if the accused had at the time promised to pay cash against delivery, an intention to do so, the fact that he did not pay, would not convert the transaction into one of cheating. But, if, on the other hand, he had no intention whatsoever to pay but merely said that he would do so in order to induce the complainant to part with the goods, then a case of cheating would be made out.",

Even in a case where allegations are made in regard to failure on the part of the accused to keep his promise, in the absence of a culpable intention at the time of making initial promise being absent, no offence under Section 420 of the IPC can be said to have been made out. In another decision in the matter of M/s Thermax Ltd. (supra), in paragraph 23, it has been held that the complaint in question was filed in the year 2002 when the alleged dispute was with respect to year 1993-95, it was found therein that the complainant was trying to circumvent the jurisdiction of the civil court which estopped him on account of law of limitation.",

The relevant observations may be quoted as under:- \"Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The economic offence having deep rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds needs to be viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country.\"  Also, the observations in State of Gujarat Vs. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal & Others (1987) 2 SCC 364 are apt to be noticed:- “5. The entire community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community. A disregard for the interest of the community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the community in the system to administer justice in an even-handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white collar crimes with a permissive eve unmindful of the damage done to the national economy and national interest.”",

The Bid Documents represented, additionally, thus:  ―The minimum post-tax Project IRR that is commensurate with the risks associated with the project and returns acceptable to investors, is around 12 percent.

Resultantly, commercial traffic, which was earlier using the Project Highway, started opting for the alternate route via Shahabad-Panchkula, inter alia to avoid payment of toll. As a result, the volume of traffic on the Project Highway, as well as toll collection, reduced. This, according to GMR, amounted  to construction, by the State of Haryana, of a ―bypass‖ within the meaning of Clause 8.1 of the CA and Clause 3.2 of the SSA, which stood breached thereby. Inasmuch as the consequent diversion of traffic to the said bypass had resulted in reduction in the toll collected by GMR, a ―material adverse effect‖, to GMR, and an ―NHAI Event of Default‖ had resulted, by application of Clause 32.4.1(3) of the CA read with Clause 32.4.1 thereof. NHAI was, therefore, bound, under Clause 37.1(ii), to indemnify GMR for the loss suffered thereby. This, in substance, constituted the claim of GMR in the SOC.",

Based on these representations, GMR contended that it had agreed to adopt the ‗Negative Grant‘ model, estimating a toll collection, in the year of commissioning of the Project Highway, i.e. 2008, of ₹ 13.3 lakhs per day, with commensurate expectation of yearly increase, as commercial traffic on the constructed Project Highway was expected to increase on a day-to-day basis. As against this expectation, GMR pointed out that, consequent on the diversion of commercial traffic as a result of the rendering, by the State of Haryana, of the Shahabad-Saha-Panchkula highway stretch as a viable Alternate Competing Route (ACR) bypass, the average toll collection per day on the Project Highway fell to ₹ 5 lakhs, which was less than 50% of the projected revenue. This, submitted GMR, substantially altered the basic  commercial understanding, premised on which the Consortium had bid for the project and had entered into the CA.",

It was contended that an expert agency, M/s ICRA Management Consultancy Service Ltd (IMACS) had been engaged by GMR to undertake a Traffic Validation Study in and around the Ambala-Chandigarh section of the Project Highway and that IMACS had, in its detailed report dated 29th September 2009 indicated, as the key reason for diversion of traffic from the Project Highway to Alternate Competing Roads, (i) the improvement of NH-73 which, at the time of execution of the CA, was a single lane road with poor surface quality, into a 2-lane road with shoulders and good surface quality, which resulted in diversion of traffic as NH-73 was connected to NH-1 at Shahabad and (ii) substantial improvement of SH-31 which, earlier, was a single lane road, with development of an ROB at Kesri and widening and improvement of the carriageway. Another traffic study conducted by IMACS on the Project Highway in October 2012, found that (i) the DPR of July 2004, by M/s CES, the Consultant of NHAI, characterised the Project Highway as a commercial and industrial corridor with very high growth potential, with the further observation that, between 2000 and 2004, traffic of cars and commercial vehicles had grown between 7% and 9% respectively, (ii) vis-à-vis the forecasts regarding the Project Highway in the bid documents, total vehicular traffic had shown about 40% decline and commercial/goods traffic using the Project Highway had shown around 80% decline, (iii) as against this, commercial traffic in the  neighbouring corridors had shown strong and aggressive growth of above 25% between 2005 and 2009, post-completion of the Project Highway, (iv) traffic plying through Delhi/Haryana/Rajasthan/South India and Mohali/Kalka/Panchkula, which was earlier using the Project Highway, was now found travelling along alternate routes, i.e. Tepla-Banur-Kharar in the State of Punjab and Shahabad-Saha-Panchkula in the State of Haryana and (v) this indicated that the traffic which, during the pre-bid period i.e. 2004-2005, was using the Project Highway had, since the Commercial Operation Date (COD), i.e. since 2008-2009, been diverted to alternate roads which had undergone substantial improvement in terms of capacity and riding quality, in the interregnum, and were toll free. The development of alternate routes, through which the traffic could divert and avoid the Project Highway, it was contended, constituted a breach of the CA as well as the SSA. On this basis, GMR claimed, from NHAI and the State of Haryana jointly & severally, an amount of ₹ 86,69,37,141/–, comprising a principal of ₹ 64,42,16,715/-and interest of ₹ 22,27,20.426/-.",

(i) the same is not a ―bypass‖ between Ambala-Chandigarh section referred to in Clause 8.1 of the Concession Agreement and (ii) any such Expressway or Tollway is not open to traffic for a period of 8 years from the appointed date.‖ Following this, the impugned Award records that, while GMR conceded that the respondents had not constructed any Expressway or Additional Tollway within the meaning of Clause 8 of the CA or Clause 3.2 of the SSA, it contended, nonetheless, that the activities of the State of Haryana amounted to construction of a ―bypass‖ to the Project Highway which breached the said Clauses.

(b)  The contractual prohibition contained in the said clauses did not, therefore, conceive of an existing State Highway or National Highway becoming a ‗bypass‘ only because of its upkeep, maintenance, strengthening or widening, which is what had been alleged in the present case by GMR.  (c)  On a true and correct interpretation of Clause 8 of the CA and Clause 3.1 of the SSA, the parties never contemplated that an existing highway could also become a bypass. Nor could the parties ever intend to consider the improvement, or maintenance of an existing highway, a major part of which was a National Highway even on the date of invitation of bids, being treated as a bypass within the meaning of Clauses 8.1 and 3.2 of the CA and SSA respectively.  Had the parties so intended, the CA and SSA would specifically have so provided.  (d)  All that Clauses 8 of the CA and 3.2 of the SSA intended to say was, therefore, ―that no new road shall be constructed so as to provide an alternate route or a parallel road to the Project Road‖.  (ii)  De hors the interpretation to be placed on Clauses 8 of the CA and 3.2 of the SSA, the learned Arbitral Tribunal observed that, as NH-73 (which, from Shahazadpur to Panchkula, was NH-7) and SH-31 were both existing Highways on the date when bids were invited and the CA was executed, they were never intended to serve as a bypass to the Project Highway, as GMR sought to allege.  (iii)  SH-31, NH-73 and NH-7 took off from Shahabad which was 23 km short of the starting point of the Project Highway. By its very nature, a bypass had necessarily to start from a point proximate to the Project Highway, and join the other end of the same road at a similar proximate point. The alleged bypass, which was a pre-existing road, branched off from as far away as 23 km from the starting point of the Project Highway and did not join the Project Highway at Chandigarh, but ended at Panchkula.  (iv)  A bypass could not predate the town or city which it intended to bypass. By its very nature, a bypass was a  subsequent development, and would come into existence only after, and not before, the coming into existence of the city, town or Highway which it bypassed. The very purpose of a bypass was decongestion of the city, town or obstruction to traffic on the road. A road or stretch could not be bypassed even before it came into existence.  (v)  The road connecting Shahabad and Panchkula was not narrow, kucha, muddy or unsteady. It was a State Highway for 17 km and a National Highway for the remaining 57 km. It could not, therefore, be suggested that the State Highway or National Highway was in such a condition that no commercial traffic could use it. Rather, there was contrary evidence to show that these two stretches were good for commercial traffic even before the construction of the ROB at Kesri or the undertaking of the repair, maintenance, widening and strengthening work.",

Had this exercise been done, the learned Arbitral Tribunal found that GMR would have been aware of the plan to construct the ROB at Kesri on SH-31, which had already been sanctioned in 2004, prior to invitation of bids and award of contract.

Being a National Highway, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that it could reasonably be assumed that it was capable of carrying heavy vehicles even prior to the execution of the CA. In that view of the matter, the expenditure incurred in widening and strengthening of NH-73 could not be regarded as a breach of the CA or the SSA.

The projections contained in the said DPR of NHAI compared favourably with the traffic value projections which emerged from the independent studies conducted by GMR through IMACS. As such, GMR proceeded on the premise that the traffic volumes on the Project Highway, as indicated in the DPR of NHAI in 2004 as well as after completion of the highway in 2008, were reliable. A comparison of the traffic volume projections reflected in the bid documents issued by NHAI with the actual traffic volume recorded on the toll plaza set up by GMR, it was submitted, clearly indicated diversion of traffic from the highway to the Alternate Competing Routes (ACRs). In this context, GMR also placed reliance on the deposition of CW-1 Venkat Subba Rao and CW-2 Amit Kumar. It was pointed out that CW-1 had specifically deposed that there was substantial reduction in the traffic volume on the project highway because of diversion of traffic to the Saha-Panchkula Highway, and that CW-2 had deposed that the actual receipts at the toll plaza were less than the revenue projected in the bid documents. Clearly, therefore, submitted GMR, the widening and strengthening of the ACRs had resulted in diversion of traffic from the project highway to the ACRs.",

                        "content": "13 The learned Arbitral Tribunal answered these issues in the negative for the following reasons:  (i)  The projected traffic volume figures in the bid documents were merely provisional and subject to verification by interested bidders. Specific disclaimers, to this effect, were contained in the bid documents as well as in the CA.  (ii)  GMR‘s own study conducted in 2005 indicated that the projected figures in the bid documents relating to traffic of commercial vehicles on the Project Highway were exaggerated. In this context, the learned Arbitral Tribunal relied on a letter dated 1st June 2009 from GMR to the Project Director, NHAI which contained the following tabular statement of the traffic volume on the Project Highway:  (iii)  Ignoring the clear indicator, in the afore-extracted tabular statement of the study conducted by GMR itself, regarding traffic volumes on the Project Highway, GMR, at its own risk, offered to bid for the project on Negative Grant Basis.  (iv)  That apart, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that GMR could not seek to contend, on the basis of the traffic volume projection as contained in the bid documents, that there was a reduction in traffic volume consequent on augmentation and strengthening of ACRs.  (v)  Even otherwise, observed the learned Arbitral Tribunal, GMR, despite having had the traffic volume on the Project Highway assessed in 2005, had not chosen to place the assessment study report on record. Nor was the person who assessed the traffic volume brought into the witness box or examined. Despite relying on the said assessment, purportedly conducted by IMACS, GMR had failed to lead evidence to prove the correctness of the assessment. The methodology by which the assessment was conducted also remained undisclosed. In the absence, therefore, of credible evidence regarding the projected traffic volume in 2005, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that GMR could not seek to plead, even on facts, that there was a reduction in traffic volume on the Project Highway.  (vi)  It was further noted by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the base figures of the traffic volume on NH-73 and SH-31, prior to execution of the CA, were not available. In the absence of such base figures, it was not possible to examine the plea of GMR that, consequent to widening and strengthening of the ACRs and other activities conducted by the State Government/NHAI, traffic volume on the ACRs had increased.  (vii)  Adverting, next, to the IMACS report of 2009, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that it suffered from the same deficiencies which plagued the IMACS report of 2005. The original report had not been placed on record, and all that was provided was an executive summary. Nor had GMR chosen to examine the author of the report. Inasmuch as the correctness of the report had been denied by NHAI, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that the onus to prove the report and establish its credibility was on GMR. Having not produced the original report and having failed to call the author of the report to the witness box, the learned Arbitral Tribunal held that GMR had failed to establish the reliability of the IMACS report of 2009.  (viii)  Even otherwise, held the learned Arbitral Tribunal, diversion of vehicles which would have used the Project Highway to the ACRs was a pure question of fact. The learned Arbitral Tribunal expressed the view that such  diversion could not be established by reference to the traffic volume on the ACRs such as on the Saha-Panchkula route, the entire traffic proceedings on the Saha-Panchkula route or on any other ACR, was not necessarily traffic which otherwise would have used the Project Highway and had diverted to the ACR. The learned Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that GMR ought to have proved, by credible evidence, that the vehicles would ordinarily have adopted the Project Highway had they not had the option of diverting via the ACR. In the context of the Shahabad-Panchkula route, GMR ought to have established that diversion took place at Shahabad. No such attempt was made. The learned Tribunal also noted, in this context, that the distances which were required to be covered using the Shahabad-Panchkula route was greater than the distance which would have to be covered using the Project Highway. It was unlikely, according to the learned Arbitral Tribunal, that commercial vehicles would opt for a longer route merely to avoid toll of ₹140/-per vehicle.  (ix)  As in the case of the IMACS report of 2009, even in respect of the report purportedly of December, 2012, GMR had placed on record only an executive summary, without the original report, unproved by the author of the report. The report of 2012 could also, therefore, not be treated as reliable or taken cognizance of.  (x)  GMR further sought to contend that the Government of Haryana had also upgraded and improved SH-31 from Shahabad to Shahzadpur. Reliance was placed, in this context, on (a) an internal letter dated 7th January, 2010 of NHAI, which recorded the fact that the Government of Haryana had widened the carriageway of the aforesaid stretch of SH-31 from 5.5 – 7.5 to 10 m., and (b) depositions of CW-1, Subba Rao and Vishal Sharma, the Executive Engineer, PWD. Apropos NH-73, GMR relied on the technical notes dated 24th/27th November 2007, 31st March 2007, 12th March 2007 and 7th August 2008 of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, indicating sanction of funds for widening and strengthening NH-73, resulting in improvement in its riding quality and considerable improvement in its capacity to handle commercial traffic. Regarding these submissions, the learned Arbitral Tribunal observed that the technical notes and administrative approvals merely indicated that SH-31 and NH-73 had been strengthened. Widening and strengthening of highways, it was observed, was not forbidden either by the CA or by the SSA and was, in fact, necessary in public interest. Widening of SH-31 or NH-73 by 1.5m could not, therefore, constitute a breach of any contractual stipulation.",

(i)  the affidavit in evidence of CW-1 (Venkata Subba Rao), in which it was stated thus:  ―24. Due to the said improvement, development and strengthening of the aforesaid sections of the State Highway namely Railway Over Bridge on Saha and Shahabad of SH-31 at Kesri and strengthening and widening of NH-73 between Saha to Panchkula in the State of Haryana (\"Alternate Routes/Competing Roads\") which hitherto were not capable of catering to heavy and other commercial vehicles, which were otherwise using the Project Highway started opting to ply on these roads by avoiding and bypassing the toll plaza of the Claimant situated at \"Dappar\" thereby substantially reducing the commercial traffic on the Project Highway passing through the toll plaza of the Claimant. Such reduction of tollable traffic on the Project Highway due to diversion of the same on the Additional Routes/Competing Roads is causing substantial loss of toll which would have otherwise have been collected by the Claimants from such vehicles, This has substantially altered the basic understanding between the Claimant and the Respondents as to the commercial and financial viability of the Project Highway thus disturbing the financial equilibrium agreed to be maintained by the parties during the concession period‖,  (ii)  the following questions put to CW-1 in cross-examination, and his response thereto:  ―Q. 70. I put it to you that the stretch from Saha-Panchkula along NH-73 was already created and was in continuous use since long before the bidding process was initiated for the project highway. What have you to say ?  Ans. Though the stretch Saha-Panchkula was in existence but has not been an alternative road due to its poor conditions and restricted carriageway. The developments undertaken by the State of Haryana post signing of Concession Agreement and State Support Agreement has resulted in enhancement of the road worthiness to a large extent resulting in creation of alternate road to the project highway.‖  (By State of Haryana)  ―Q.45 Is it correct that average speed of commercial vehicles on GMR Project Road is more than average speed of commercial vehicle plying on the alleged bye-pass road?  Ans. The speed of vehicles on the highway is a direct function of density of traffic on that particular highway. Since in the current context the most of the commercial traffic from the Project Highway has diverted to the bye-pass the speed of commercial traffic on bye-pass is obviously going to be lesser than that of the Project Highway.‖  Q.46 On which point of Project Highway commercial traffic has been diverted as per your above answer to question No. 45 ?  Ans. The commercial traffic which was earlier using the Project Highway has diverted to the bye-pass which is starting at the junction of SH-31 and NH-1.‖  (iii)  para 5 of the preliminary submissions in the amended written statement dated 28th May 2015, filed by the State of Haryana, in which was stated thus:  ―That the stretch of road from Shahabad-Saha was having very bad condition and was got repaired for convenience of the traffic.‖  (iv)  letter dated 23rd July 2010 from GMR to the Government of Haryana in which it was specifically alleged that, prior to the construction of the ROB at Kesri and strengthening and widening of NH-73, SH-31 and NH-73 were ―not worthy of catering to heavy commercial traffic‖, which was not rebutted in the reply dated 17th August 2010 of the State of Haryana,  (v)  letter dated 31st August 2010 from GMR to the Government of Haryana, in which, too, it was alleged that ―when the bidding process for the project was initiated by NHAI in the year 2002, these two roads were not strong enough to cater to the commercial traffic‖, which was not denied by the State of Haryana in its reply dated 17th September 2010 thereto, and  (vi)  para 4.19 of the SOC, in which it was alleged that SH-31 and NH-73 were ―hereto ....not capable to cater to heavy commercial vehicles‖, which was not specifically rebutted in the corresponding para of the amended written statement filed by the State of Haryana.",

(i)  Presently it is a two lane road with Shoulders with good surface quality.  (ii)  NH-73 is connected to NH-j at Shahabad and traffic is diverted.  b)  SH-3l which was a single lane road during the bid stage has undergone substantial improvement with development of RoB at Kesri and widening and improvement of that carriageway.‖  (ii)  letter dated 7th January 2010 from the Project Director, NHAI, to the Regional Officer, NHAI, which acknowledged that (a) SH-31 had ―been upgraded with construction of ROB on the railway line crossing on Ambala-Yamuna Nagar section and widening of 5.5/7.5 meters carriageway to a width of 10 meters carriageway in  the year 2007-08‖ and (b) ―the widening of NH-73 has also been carried to a width of 7.5 metres-10 meters during this period‖,  (iii) Question No. 65 put to CW-1 by the State of Haryana and the response of CW-1 thereto, which read thus:  ―Q.65 I draw your attention to document C-16 at Page 212 of Vol III of the Claimant s document.

Yes.‖  (iv) the following recital, contained in the impugned award itself:  ―It was argued on behalf of the Claimant that apart from the construction of RoB at Kesri, the Respondent, the State of Haryana had also improved and upgraded SH-31 from Shahabad to Shahzadpur. Reliance in support of that submission was placed upon a letter dated 7th January 2010 from the Project Director of NHAI to the Regional Officer NHAI of the said authority, which inter alia states that the State Govt. has widened SH-31 from 5.5 to 7.5 meters carriageway to II width of 10 meters. The letter also refers to the widening of NH-73 with the help of funds provided by MORTH and the State PWD. Reliance was also placed upon the deposition of Mr. Vishal Sharma, Executive Engineer PWD, Haryana, to contend that apart from construction of the RoB at Kesri, SH-31 has also been upgraded, Deposition of Mr. D.

                        "content": "5 Re. diversion of traffic consequent to activities on Shahabad-Panchkula highway: The following evidence, which indicated that,  consequent to the construction of ROB at Kesri and widening/strengthening of NH-73, traffic which was earlier using the project highway had been diverted to SH-31 and NH-73, was also ignored by the learned Arbitral Tribunal:  (i)  para 28 of the affidavit in evidence of CW-1, which relied on toll data of an existing toll on the project highway, operated by M/s RS Builders and Engineers Ltd., indicating a sharp drop in commercial traffic immediately consequent on opening of the ROB constructed at Kesri, which went un-rebutted in cross-examination,  (ii)  letter dated 30th June 2010 from the Regional Officer, NHAI to the General Manager (Technical), P&H, NHAI, in which it was specifically recorded thus:  ―On the contrary, there was reduction of traffic along the project corridor post commissioning of the competing facilities in the neighborhood such us the ROB on SH-31 between Shahabad and Saha, improvement of the Saha -Panchkula section on NH-73 which is substantiated by RSIL 's toll revenue data. From the above analysis of the Concessionaire, it is noted that the improvement of allied infrastructure in terms of upgradation of SH, MDR and construction of ROB has resulted in leakage of revenue for the Concessionaire of Ambala Chandigarh Expressway. The traffic getting diverted from NH1 to NH73 for onwards journey to Panchkula or Himachal Pradesh, actually travels 11 km more but saves the user fee of Ambala Chandigarh Expressway and excise, entry tax on the border of Hr and Pb States. Similarly, the traffic coming from Ambala leading to Zirakpur covers the same distance but follows the NH1 up to Sabhu border (at km 212.165) deviates to Banur to reach Zirakpur by avoiding the user fee of Ambala Chandigarh Expressway.  The issue has been examined with respect to the provisions related to Additional Tollway in Section 8.1 of the Concession Agreement. Prima facie, the development of ROB on SH-31 (by Haryana State PWD) in conjunction with the upgradation of Saha·Panchkula section of NH-73 from 2-lane to 2-land paved shoulder (by NH-Division, PWD, Government of Haryana) has convened the corridor from Sahabad on NH-I to Zirakpur on NH-22 via Saha and Panchkula into a bypass for the Project Highway as defined in Clause 8.1. However, this highway was already in existence prior to bidding for Ambala-Chandigarh highway only, there was improvement with a ROB.  As per Clause 8, any such development before eighth anniversary of project by the authorities is not in compliance with the provisions of the Concession Agreement. Also, as per Clause 8.4, the above developments also call for implementation of clause 8,4 i.e., to toll the corridor from Sahabad on NH-1 to Zirakpur on NH-22 via Saha and Panchkulo, whereby per Krn toll fee to be collected on NH-73 shall be 133% of the per Km. fee levied and collected from similar vehicle or class of vehicles using the Amhala-Chandigarh Highway (Project Highway).  Sub-clause 8.1 and 8.4 both are in favour of the concessionaire in the event of considering the above developments as additional toll way/bypass to project highway. In case the provision sub-clause 8.4 are to be operated the issue is required to be deliberated now itself as work of upgradation of NH-73from 2 land to 4 lane carriageway width is in bidding stage and the same should be made clear to the bidders now itself.  In view of the forgoing paras it has been observed that the parallel development by Stare Govt, like NH-73 Lehli-Banur road were improvement of existing facilities which seems to have affected the viability of  the subject project corridor, which needs due attention of NHAI.‖  (Emphasis supplied)  (iii)  the minutes of the Mediation Meeting dated 15th July 2010 between NHAI and GMR held in terms of Clause 39.1(b) of the CA, in which it was recorded thus:  ―It was noticed that there had been some effect of opening of ROB on SH-3 in the revenue/toll collection of M/s RS Infrastructure in the year 2007-2008 as compared to 2006-2007 as presented by M/s GMR. The state roads, namely Bannur-Lehli and Tepla-Banur-Kharar Sections were also found to be having some effect on the toll collections on account of location of toll plaza in Duppar. Accordingly, various portions available under the concession were deliberated. On deliberation, it was observed that the cause for diversion of traffic has not arisen out of the acts of NHAI, but the same has happened on account of development of various facilities by the State Govt. Of Haryana & Punjab.”  (Emphasis supplied)  (iv)  letter dated 26th August 2010 from the CGM-cum-Regional Officer, NHAI, Chandigarh to the Member (Project), NHAI, consequent to the aforesaid second mediation meeting, in which a detailed recital of the claims of GMR was set out, followed by the following acknowledgement:  ―The total loss projected by Concessionaire on account of diversion of traffic to competing roads from the date of commissioning of toll operations i.e., Dec'08 till June’10 comes to Rs. 34.76 Crores.  The Concessionaire has been given all the supporting documents in support of the traffic counts carried out  by different agencies including GMR itself. By going through the details provided by Concessionaire the loss projected by the concessionaire seems, to be broadly justified. Accordingly, respective State Governments needs to be notified in accordance with the provisions of the Clause 7 of the State Support Agreement. Therefore further necessary action may please be taken at NHAI HQ in notifying to the State Govt. of Punjab and Haryana.‖  (Emphasis supplied)  (v)  the specific assertion of GMR, in its letter dated 23rd July 2010 to Government of Haryana, to the effect that commercial traffic had been diverted from the project highway to the ACR from Shahbad to Panchkula, consequent to the development of the ROB at Kesri and the widening and strengthening of the stretch between Saha and Panchkula, which was not denied in the reply dated 17th August 2010, of Government of Haryana thereto,  (vi)  the similar assertion by GMR, in its letter dated 31st August 2010 to Government of Haryana which, too, was not denied by Government of Haryana in its reply dated 17th September 2010,  (vii)  para 24 of the affidavit in evidence of CW-1, in which it was specifically deposed as under:  ―24. Due to the said improvement, development and strengthening of the aforesaid sections of the State Highway namely Railway Over Bridge on Saha and Shahabad of SH-31 at Kesri and strengthening and widening of NH-73 between Saha to Panchkula in the  State of Haryana (\"Alternate Routes/Competing Roads\") which hitherto were not capable of catering to heavy and other commercial vehicles, which were otherwise using the Project Highway started opting to ply on these roads by avoiding and bypassing the toll plaza of the Claimant situated at \"Dappar\" thereby substantially reducing the commercial traffic on the Project Highway passing through the toll plaza of the Claimant. Such reduction of tollable traffic on the Project Highway due to diversion of the same on the Additional Routes/Competing Roads is causing substantial loss of toll which would have otherwise have been collected by the Claimants from such vehicles.‖  (viii)  Question 70 posed by NHAI and Question 46 posed by the State of Haryana to CW-1 in cross-examination and his response thereto, both of which stand already reproduced hereinabove,  (ix)  the IMACS reports dated 29th September 2009 and December 2012 which clearly established that there had been reduction in the traffic volume on the project highway and diversion of traffic to the ACRs, consequent on their widening, strengthening and redevelopment, on which no question whatsoever was posed to CW-1 and no doubts were expressed regarding the correctness or authenticity of the said reports or the data reflected therein and the findings arrived at on the basis thereof, and  (x)  para 26 of the affidavit in evidence of CW-1 in which he specifically deposed that he was part of the 2009 study  conducted by the IMACS, on which CW-1 relied, apart from the 2012 IMACS report.",

The attention of the Court has been invited to the fact that, vide letter dated 24th July 2013, GMR had, after inspecting documents at the head office of NHAI,  requested for as many as 21 documents. Subsequently, applications were also filed by GMR, before the learned Arbitral Tribunal for a direction to NHAI to produce the aforesaid 21 documents. The said application was allowed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal vide communication/order dated 7th October 2013, addressed by the learned Presiding Member of the learned Arbitral Tribunal to the parties and their respective Counsel, which read thus:  ―Sirs,  This has reference to the applications made by the advocates for the Claimant on 29th August, 2013 seeking directions to the first Respondent to provide copies of the documents therein mentioned, which have already been inspected by the Claimant, and to the e-mail from the Presiding Arbitrator pointing out that no responses had been filed to those application and directing that such responses should be filed on or before 4th October, 2013.  No responses have thus far been received.  The Tribunal, therefore, allows the applications of the Claimant of 29th August, 2013 and directs the first Respondent to provide copies/photocopies of the documents that have been inspected by the Claimant and are referred to in the said applications. This shall be done within 4 weeks from today and it shall be done at the cost of the Claimant.  Yours faithfully  S.P.Bharucha ‖  (Emphasis supplied)  The aforesaid direction was reiterated by the learned Arbitral Tribunal in its minutes/order dated 29th March 2014 (which appears erroneously to have recorded the earlier order as 5th October 2013  instead of 7th October 2013) and order dated 13th September 2014, which again reiterated the direction to NHAI to produce the documents mentioned in the order dated 7th October 2013, of which inspection had already been allowed to GMR. The said 21 documents were not made available by NHAI, despite four orders having been passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal. GMR sought to contend that the defiance, by NHAI, to comply with the directions issued by the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not only violative of the principles of natural justice but ought also to have necessarily invited an adverse inference against NHAI. Despite this fact having been brought to the notice of the learned Arbitral Tribunal, it is pointed out that the impugned Award does not reflect any application of mind thereto. It is submitted that Sections 181and 282 of the 1996 Act stand infracted thereby.",

(ii)  The principles of natural justice, as also Sections 18 and 28 of the 1996 Act, were violated, as 21 documents, of which GMR had been allowed inspection and which were vital to GMR establishing its case, had been directed, by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, to be produced by NHAI on as many as three occasions but the direction was never complied with. This ought to have invited an adverse inference against NHAI and in favour of GMR.  The learned Arbitral Tribunal, however, completely ignored this fact.  (iii)  Both the reports of the IMACS dated 29th September 2009 and December 2012, were ignored by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, despite categorically confirming the case that GMR sought to set up, i.e. that, consequent to strengthening and development of the Shahabad-Panchkula stretch, it had emerged as an ACR and a bye-pass to the project highway, through which traffic had been diverted resulting in loss to GMR.",

The submissions advanced, on the basis thereof, may be enumerated as under:  (i)  The claims of the petitioner were based on the representations, forecasts and figures provided by NHAI in the RFP, which could not have been relied upon, in view of the disclaimer clauses contained therein.  (ii)  No bypass had been constructed, either by the NHAI or by the State of Haryana, within the meaning of Clause 8.1 of the CA or Clauses 3.2 of the SSA.  (iii)  Section 8A of the NH Act was of no application. It merely prescribed the method for fixing the toll fee by the Central Government. NHAI had no concern with the said provision.  (iv)  Internal communications between officers of the NHAI, it was rightly held, could not have been relied upon by GMR, as they did not constitute admissions and were of no probative value.  (v)  It was absurd to contend that the CA or the SSA prohibited the NHAI from maintaining or improving preexisting roads or highways. No such prohibition, for that matter, existed either in the CA or in the SSA.  (vi)  The IMACS report, cited by GMR, was of no evidentiary value as it was merely an executive summary, and the original report, from which the summary was prepared, had never been produced by GMR. Equally, the author of the report had also not been cited as a witness.  (vii)  The learned Arbitral Tribunal had correctly held that GMR had failed to prove that the construction of the ROB at Kesri and widening and strengthening of the highway between Saha and Panchkula had resulted in diversion of commercial traffic which was otherwise plying on the Project Highway.  (viii)  Equally, the GMR had failed to prove that the said changes, effected on the Shahabad-Panchkula highway, had affected the fundamental economics of the CA. Under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, a Court could not sit in appeal over the reasoning of the learned Arbitral Tribunal. All that the Court was required to examine was whether the reasoning was plausible. If it was, no case for interference could be said to exist.  (ix)  Despite having carried out its own studies and, therefore, ascertained that the traffic volume projections in  the bid documents was exaggerated, GMR, nonetheless, opted to bid on negative grant basis. Though GMR contended that it had itself conducted a traffic volume assessment as in 2008, at the time of bidding for the project, and had found the figures arrived at in the said assessment to corroborate the figures in the DPR, GMR had failed to place on record the report obtained by it at that point of time.  (x)  Thus, GMR was guilty of withholding best evidence, justifying an adverse inference against it. Reliance was placed, for this purpose, on Gopal Krishnaji Ketkar v. Mohamed Haji Latif3 .  (xi)  Clause 8 of the CA and Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 of the SSA prohibited construction of Expressway and Additional Tollway for eight years. Neither was any Expressway, nor was any Additional Tollway, constructed. The State of Haryana had merely maintained, improved, widened and strengthened the alternative roads around the project highway, without violating provisions of the SSA. Neither CA nor the SSA contained any proscription against improvement, widening or maintenance of the existing roads. Interestingly, in this context, the State of Haryana contends thus, in its written submission:  ―The contractual prohibition contained in the clauses of the agreement did not prohibit an existing state highway or any existing national highway to become  any road a “bypass” only because of its upkeep, maintenance, strengthening or widening. The provisions of the Clause 8 of the Concession agreement and Clause 3.2 of the SSA prohibited the GOI, NHAI and the State of Haryana & Punjab from constructing a bypass between Ambala & Zirakpur and all they intended to say was that no new road shall be constructed to provide an alternate route or a parallel road to the project highway. If the Applicant wanted to restrict the Respondent from any such improvement or development they should have provided for the same and specifically forbidden it.‖  3 AIR 1968 SC 1413  The State of Haryana, thereby, impliedly acknowledged that, by the strengthening and widening of the existing parallel highways, they had become viable bypasses to the Project Highway. That, however, according to the State of Haryana, was not prohibited by the CA or SSA, which merely prohibited construction of a new road.",

Ordinarily, the Arbitral Tribunal is the final arbiter on all aspects factual and legal. Interpretation of contractual covenants is ordinarily the province of the Arbitral Tribunal. The scope of interference, with the manner in which an Arbitral Tribunal interprets contractual covenants, is heavily circumscribed. A Section 34 Court cannot interfere with an Arbitral Tribunal on the ground that the Arbitral Tribunal has not interpreted the contractual covenants correctly, as, in its view the covenants were  required to be differently interpreted. The Court cannot, therefore, substitute the interpretation of the contractual covenants which, according to it, is most appropriate, in place of the interpretation that the learned Arbitral Tribunal has chosen to place thereon. It is only where the interpretation of the contractual covenants is plainly unacceptable, or contradictory to well settled principles governing interpretation of contractual covenants, or the interpretation accorded by the Arbitral Tribunal to a contractual covenant would be contrary to other covenants of the same contract, that the Section 34 Court can interfere. In N.H.A.I. v. Progressive MVR JV4 , the Supreme Court has, however, also endorsed interference under Section 34 where different Arbitral Tribunals, dealing with the same contract or with identical contractual covenants, have arrived at different conclusions. Absent these limited grounds, an Arbitral Award cannot be interfered with, under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, on the ground that the interpretation of the contractual covenants, by the Arbitral Tribunal is not palatable, or even acceptable, to the Court.",

Explanation. – Without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (ii), it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of any doubt, that an award is in conflict with the public policy of India if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81.  (3)  An application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had been made under Section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed of by the Arbitral Tribunal:  Provided that if the court is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty days, but not thereafter.  (4)  On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the court may, where it is appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the Arbitral Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of Arbitral Tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.‖  Section 34 of the 1996 Act as it stood when Associate Builders5 was  rendered, therefore, did not contain any specific provision permitting interference with an Arbitral Award, predicated on the merits of the Award.

The Supreme Court approved principle enunciated in the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in CRW Joint Operation v. PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK27 which, in turn, relied on the following enunciation of the law in ―Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration‖ (Oxford University Press, 5th Edn., 2009):  25(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence  ―The significance of the issues that were not dealt with has to be considered in relation to the award as a whole. For example, it is not difficult to envisage a situation in which the issues that were overlooked were of such importance that, if they had been dealt with, the whole balance of the award would have been altered and its effect would have been different.‖  The Court faced with a submission by an aggrieved litigant that the Arbitral Tribunal had failed to consider a contention advanced before it is, therefore, required to examine whether, if the Arbitral Tribunal would have considered the contention, the outcome may have been different. If the answer to this query is in the negative, no cause for interference exists, merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has not considered the contention. If, however, the Court comes to the conclusion that, were the contention to be considered, the outcome of the proceedings might have been different, the failure, on the part of  the Arbitral Tribunal, in considering the contention, would imperil the award.  26 (2019) 15 SCC 131  27 2011 SGCA 33",

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.33 with respect to the scope of interference with arbitral awards under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, went on to hold, with respect to the facts before it, that Clause 6(b) of the agreement between the State of Chhattisgarh and Sal Udyog clearly included, in the expenses incurred by the State Government towards supply of sal seeds, supervision charges. The agreement also envisaged that supply of sal seeds would be against advanced payment.  The Supreme Court held that, in turning down the plea of the State of Chhattisgarh regarding recoverability of supervision expenses, predicated on clause 6(b) of the Agreement, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had given a complete go by to the terms and conditions of the agreement between the parties. This, held the Supreme Court, amounted to ―patent illegality‖ manifest on the face of the Arbitral Award.  Para 26 of the report concluded thus:  ―26. To sum up, existence of Clause 6(b) in the agreement governing the parties, has not been disputed, nor has the application of the Circular dated 27-7-1987 issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh regarding imposition of 10% supervision charges and adding the same to cost of the Sal seeds, after deducting the actual expenditure been questioned  by the respondent Company. We are, therefore, of the view that failure on the part of the learned sole arbitrator to decide in accordance with the terms of the contract governing the parties, would certainly attract the ―patent illegality ground‖, as the said oversight amounts to gross contravention of Section 28(3) of the 1996 Act, that enjoins the Arbitral Tribunal to take into account the terms of the contract while making an award. The said ―patent illegality‖ is not only apparent on the face of the award, it goes to the very root of the matter and deserves interference. Accordingly, the present appeal is partly allowed and the impugned award, insofar as it has permitted deduction of ―supervision charges‖ recovered from the respondent Company by the appellant State as a part of the expenditure incurred by it while calculating the price of the Sal seeds, is quashed and set aside, being in direct conflict with the terms of the contract governing the parties and the relevant circular.

The Supreme Court nonetheless noted that the issue of whether the learned Arbitrator had appropriately considered the aspect of applying the market value notifying as a guided value, who had afforded due opportunity to NHAI in that regard, still remained to be examined.

In such event an error if found, though it would not be possible for the Court entertaining the petition under Section 34 or for the appellate court under Section 37 of Act 1996 to modify the award and alter the compensation as it was open to the court in the reference proceedings under Section 18 of the old Land Acquisition Act or an appeal under Section 54 of that act, it should certainly be open to the court exercising power under Section 34 of Act, 1996 to set aside the award by indicating reasons and remitting the matter to the Arbitrator to reconsider the same in accordance with law.

Nagaraju30 , it was not permissible for a Section 34 Court to modify the Award passed by the learned Arbitrator, and the Court, even it found the challenge to the substantial, would have to set aside the Award and remit the matter to the learned Arbitrator for de novo consideration.  The Supreme Court addressed the first contention advanced by the NHAI, before it, thus (in paras 35 to 37 of the report):  ―35. In that view, the question that would arise for consideration in the case on hand is as to whether the award passed by the learned Arbitrator would stand vitiated merely because the guideline dated 28.03.2016 which is marginally subsequent in point of time is reckoned, when the acquisition notification under Section 3A of NH Act was prior to the same i.e. on 01.02.2016. As already noted, Section 3G(7)(a) of NH Act provides for determination of the market value on the date of publication of the acquisition notification under Section 3A. In a normal circumstance, for the determination of the market value, the rate prevailing prior to the date of the notification shall be the basis more particularly when the determination is made based on sale exemplars, as otherwise there is a likelihood of manipulation with escalated price being dishonestly indicated in the subsequent transactions. While taking note of the documents relied on for the purpose of determination of the market value, the existence of appropriate documents in the facts of each case would also become relevant. In circumstances where a document which is proximal to the date of acquisition is not available, it would be open to rely on a document which is much prior in point of time and if the time gap is more, determination could be made by providing for reasonable escalation depending on the area wherein the acquired property is situate and nature of property. Similarly, in a circumstance where no document which is prior to the date of the acquisition notification is available and the exemplars are subsequent to the date of acquisition notification, the value therein could be noted and reasonable de-escalation be considered to determine the appropriate value. Needless to mention that no strait-jacket  formula can be applicable to all cases with arithmetical precision in the matter of determination of compensation.",

In a normal circumstance, even if the notification dated 07.11.2014 was taken into consideration it would be open for the learned Arbitrator to consider certain amount of escalation to determine the market value. The said process could have been adopted if there was no other document. At this juncture, it is necessary to note that the SLAO in fact had relied on the said notification dated 07.11.2014 and determined the market value but had ignored the fact that the lands regarding which the market value was to be determined had been converted for purposes other than agriculture. The SLAO had therefore taken into consideration the registration value which had been fixed in respect of the agricultural property. In that light, firstly it would have been open for the learned Arbitrator to take note of the value fixed for the commercial/industrial lands under that notification itself and provide certain amount of escalation.",

Further, though the preliminary notification for acquisition was issued on 01.02.2016, the final notification under Section 3D of NH Act was issued on 23.09.2016. During the intervening period the guideline value notification dated 28.03.2016, the process for which had commenced through the notification dated 14.09.2015, was already published. Furthermore, when all these proceedings were in close proximity to the date of the preliminary notification for acquisition and the revision of the market value by the Department of Stamps and Registration itself was within a period of one year and 4 months from the  earlier guideline value published on 07.11.2014, it would indicate that the escalation which was otherwise open for being worked out and applied by the learned Arbitrator on taking note of the notification dated 07.11.2014 was undertaken by the Department of Stamps and Registration and the benefit of considering such escalation was available to the learned Arbitrator by taking note of the guideline dated 28.03.2016, though technically published on a date subsequent to the preliminary notification dated 01.02.2016. In that view of the matter, in the present facts and circumstances, the reliance placed on the guideline value notification dated 28.03.2016 for reckoning the market value of the property acquired under the preliminary notification dated 01.02.2016, by itself cannot be accepted to be a patent illegality committed by the learned Arbitrator.‖",

The Supreme Court held that the guideline value notification dated 28th March 2016 fixed the value of the land acquired in the ―City Greens‖ and ―Zunadu‖ layouts and not to the layout in which the land acquired by the respondents before the Supreme Court was situate. In that regard, the Supreme Court held thus (in para 42 of the report):  ―42. .... If the value as fixed under the guideline for ‗City Greens‘ and ‗Zunadu‘ was to be adopted as comparable land to the acquired land, necessary reasons ought to have been indicated in the award with reference to the evidence brought on record, with opportunity to NHAI to have their say on that  aspect and reasons justifying such comparison should have been recorded. Further the manner in which the notification dated 28.03.2016 has been relied upon and the value fixed under the said notification in respect of two distinct layouts has been automatically made applicable to the lands in question despite noting the guideline value notified for the same survey number would indicate that the said exercise has been undertaken without sufficient opportunity to NHAI. Further, appropriate reasons have not been indicated by the learned Arbitrator to arrive at the conclusion to uniformly adopt the value of Rs. 15,400/-per sq.mtr fixed in respect of lands in a layout which was separately indicated in the notification. As stated above, if there is evidence brought on record in the manner known to law with opportunity to the opposite side, it certainly would be open for the learned Arbitrator to adopt the said value. However, from the pleading in the claim petition and from the portion extracted from the award which is the only basis for the ultimate order made by the learned Arbitrator, it would indicate that the NHAI did not have sufficient opportunity before the learned Arbitrator to controvert the material sought to be relied upon by the learned Arbitrator nor has the learned Arbitrator indicated sufficient reasons which to that extent would indicate patent illegality in the award passed by the learned Arbitrator being contrary to Section28(2) and 31(3) of Act, 1996.‖",

                        "content": "Application of understanding of ―bypass‖ by the learned Arbitral Tribunal to the facts of the present case – the raison d’etre of the impugned Award  Having thus extracted the meaning of ―bypass‖ as contained in authoritative dictionaries, the learned Arbitral Tribunal goes on, in the following passages, to set out, in sum and substance as it were, the raison d’ etre for the impugned Award:  ―It is therefore reasonable to say that a Bye Pass is a stretch of road that circumvents a town or city with a view to avoiding traffic congestion which generally slows down the vehicular movement. That being so, a 'Bye Pass' in the case at hand would textually and contextually imply a road that is meant to provide to the truckers motorists and other users of tile road, the means to avoid the Project road between Ambala and Zirakpur. It would also mean that the bypass is constructed with the intention of bye-passing the \"Project Road'. In as much as Clause 8 of the Concession Agreement and Clause 3.2 of the State Support Agreement both forbid the GOI, NHAI, State of Haryana and State of Punjab from constructing a road that is a Bye pass to the Project Road, the prohibition must of necessity apply in future. The contractual prohibition contained in the clauses extracted above does not in our opinion conceive of an existing State Highway or any existing National Highway becoming a 'Bye Pass' only because of its upkeep, maintenance, strengthening or widening, as is the position here. We therefore have no hesitation in holding that on a true und correct interpretation of the two clauses, in the literal and contextual setting in which the expression 'Bye Pass' is used therein, the parties never contemplated that an existing Highway like the one from Shahabad to Panchkula, could also become a Bye Pass. Nor could the parties ever intend to consider the improvement or maintenance of an existing highway, major part whereof was a National Highway even on the date the Bids were invited being treated as a Bye Pass so as to fall foul of Clauses 8.1 and 3.2 of the Concession and State Support Agreements. Indeed, if parties ever intended to mean that an existing highway could also become a Bye Pass, by reason of  its improvement or strengthening, they would have provided for such a contingency and specifically forbidden it. In as much as the provisions of clauses 8 of the Concession Agreement and Clause 3.2 of the Stale Support Agreements prohibited the GoI, NHAI, the State of Haryana and State of Punjab, from constructing a Bye Pass, between Ambala and Zirakpur, all that they intended to say was that no new road shall be constructed so as to provide an alternate route or parallel road to the Project Road.  Interpretation of Clauses 8 and 3.2 apart, it is important to remember that NH-73 starts from Sahazadpur and goes up to Shahzadpur in the State of Haryana. From Shahzadpur upto Panchkula it is NH-7. Both these Highways were pre-existing as on the date of the Bids and the execution of the Concession and State Support Agreements. It was not as though Saharanpur to Shahzadpur via Yamunanagar and Saha was ever constructed to be used as a bypass for the Project Road. So also, the Highway from Shahzadpur to Panchkula was also a pre-existing National Highway which was very much in existence as on the date of the bids and the execution of the agreements. Both NH-73 and NH-7 were serving the states of U.P., Haryana, Himachal and other neighbouring States, as full-fledged Highways and not as alleged Bye Passes for the Project Road. That is true even about State Highway No.31 from Shahabad to Saba in the State of Haryana, which too was an existing Highway and was never meant to be or constructed to serve as a Bye Pass to the Project Road of the Claimant as alleged.  Also significant is the fact that the so called -Bye PMS, (SH-31, NH-73 & NH-7) takes off from Shahabad which is 23 kms short of the starting point of the Project road. A bypass, in the ordinary course and in the very nature of the things must start from a proximate point and join the other end of the same road -at a proximate point. While it is not (possible to stipulate a precise distance in this regard, it appears to us to be little unusual for a (road to be called a 'Bye Pass' even when it is a pre-existing road and even when it takes off from a point that is as far away as 23 kms from the beginning/starting point of the Project Road. So also, the alleged Bye Pass does not join the Project Road at Chandigarh end.  Instead it ends at Panchkula in Haryana.  There is another dimension to the question which may also be examined at this stage. A Bye Pass, it is obvious cannot come into existence or predate the Town or City or even a (stretch of road intended to be bypassed. A bypass is by its very nature and purpose a subsequent development. It cannot precede the city, town or the road to be bypassed. Since the very purpose of the Bye Pass is to Bye Pass the city or town or a stretch of the Highway, it will come into existence only after and not before the city, town or the Highway comes into existence. That is especially so when the very purpose of the Bye pass is to decongest the city, town or obstruction to traffic on the road. It would be anomalous to say that a Bye pass can be constructed even before the city or town comes into existence nor can a road or stretch thereof be bypassed before any such road or stretch comes into existence. The argument, that the pre-existing Highways in the present case were a Bye Pass, must therefore be noticed only to be rejected.  So also, the argument that if the road is narrow, the same cannot be a Bye Pass has not impressed us. In the first place the road connecting Shahabad and Panchkula was not a narrow, kucha, muddy or an unsteady road which could not he treated to be even a road or a viable alternative. The road between Shahabad and Panchkula was a State Highway for 17 kms and a National Highway for the remaining 57 kms. No one could suggest that the State Highway was unfit for commercial traffic much less could it be said that a National Highway was so poor in its carrying capacity, strength, width or riding comfort that no commercial traffic was possible over it. There is on the contrary, evidence to show that the two stretches were good for commercial traffic even before the construction of ROB at Kesri or the repair, maintenance, widening and strengthening that was undertaken. The alleged breach of clauses 8 and 3.2 of the Concession Agreement and the State Support Agreement respectively therefore remains un-substantiated and is accordingly rejected.‖",

A ―bypass‖, therefore, by its very nature, has two features. The first is that it must be a road, other than the project road, connecting the points which the project road connects. The second is that it must be motorable by the traffic to which project road is expected to cater. A second road, which may exist between the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem of the project road, but which is not motorable to commercial traffic, would not be a bypass, as it would not provide an alternative for commercial traffic to avoid the project road. If, however, the road is so modified – if, for example, a two lane road is converted into a four or eight lane road – as would make it usable by commercial traffic, such modification would convert the road into a bypass. If such modification is carried out by the State of Haryana, the State of Punjab or the NHAI during the currency of the CA or the SSA, it cannot be said that no bypass has been constructed, merely because the road existed even at the time of execution of the CA or the SSA. If the upgradation/improvement of the road, by the State of Haryana or the State of Punjab, renders the road motorable to commercial traffic and, therefore, a viable alternative to the project road, such upgradation/improvement has to be regarded as having  resulted in construction of a bypass and, therefore, having violated Clause 8.1 of the CA and Clause 3.2 of the SSA.",

The fallacy in this finding is, in my opinion, apparent from its bare reading. There can be no doubt that a road or a stretch of a road cannot be bypassed before a road or stretch comes into existence. To that extent, the finding of the learned Arbitral Tribunal is unexceptionable. It is plainly logical that a road can be bypassed only if the road exists. Before the road comes into existence, it is obvious that it cannot be bypassed. That is, however, altogether different from saying that the bypass could not be in existence before the road came into existence. More specifically, and pertinently to the present case, a road which was in existence prior to the project road but is not a bypass at that point of time, because it does not provide an alternative viable mode of travel, may become a bypass if, during the currency of the project, the road is made motorable to commercial traffic. The project road is, therefore, ―bypassed‖ only when the alternative road has been made viable to commercial traffic and has, therefore, become a bypass. While it is correct, therefore, to observe that a road cannot be bypassed before the road itself comes into existence, it is not, in my respectful view, correct to hold that the ―bypassing road‖ could not have been in existence prior to the project road.

It does not require the bypass to start and end at points proximate to the road which is bypassed. The learned Arbitral Tribunal has itself held that a road which is meant to provide, to truckers, motorists and other users thereof, the means to avoid the project road, would amount to a bypass. All that the learned Arbitral Tribunal was required to do, therefore, was to examine whether, by its act, the State of Haryana had brought into existence a road which provided, to truckers, motorists and other users of the road, a means to avoid the project road.

This test requires that a term can only be implied if it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract to avoid such a failure of consideration that the parties cannot as reasonable businessmen have intended. But only the most limited term should then be implied – the bare minimum to achieve this goal. If the contract makes business sense without the term, the courts will not imply the same. The following passage from the opinion of Bowen, L.J. in The Moorcock39 :  ‗… In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are businessmen; not to impose on one side all the perils of the transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure, but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those perils or chances.‘ ‖",

It is this ground rule which is the basis of The Moorcock39 test of giving ―business efficacy‖ to the transaction, as must have been intended at all events by both business parties. The development of law saw the ―five condition test‖ for an implied condition to be read into the contract including the ―business efficacy‖ test. It also sought to incorporate ―the Officious Bystander Test‖ [Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd.41]. This test has been set out in B.P. Refinery (Westernport) Proprietary Ltd. v. Shire of Hastings42 , requiring the requisite conditions to be satisfied: (1) reasonable and equitable; (2) necessary to give business efficacy to the contract; (3) it goes without saying i.e. the Officious Bystander Test; (4) capable of clear expression; and (5) must not contradict any express term of the contract.

Allowing the appeal, the UK Supreme Court provided the guiding principle for resolution of such ambiguity, keeping the ‗business common sense‘ as central:  ―The language used by the parties will often have more than one potential meaning. I would accept the submission made on behalf of the appellants that the exercise of construction is essentially one unitary exercise in which the court must consider the language used and ascertain what a reasonable person, that is a person who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract, would have understood the parties to have meant.

That meaning has to be assessed in the light of (i) the natural and ordinary meaning of the clause, (ii) any other relevant provisions of the lease, (iii) the overall purpose of the clause and the lease, (iv) the facts and circumstances known or assumed by the parties at the time that the document was executed, and (v) commercial common sense, but (vi) disregarding subjective evidence of any party's intentions.

It is also true that a Court should not interfere with the manner in which the Arbitral Tribunal has chosen to interpret the contractual covenants, merely because another interpretation appears, to the Court, to be more apposite. Nor would a Court exercising Section 34  48 [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 A.C. 1101  49  [1976] 1 WLR 989 (2), 995-997 per Lord Wilberforce  50 [2002] 1 A.C. 251  jurisdiction, substitute, for the interpretation placed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, its own interpretation of the contractual clauses. The subjective satisfaction of Section 34 Court cannot be permitted to substitute the subjective satisfaction of the Arbitral Tribunal, insofar as the interpretation of the clauses of the contract is concerned.",

The Court, or the Arbitrator, dealing with the CA, is required to bear in mind the fact that the DPR traffic projections contained specific projections about the Annual Toll Revenue which would be earned by a bidder who opted for the Negative Grant route. It is useful, in this context, to reproduce the DPR, Annual Toll Revenue, as depicted in the DPR, in extenso, to know what exactly was held out to the prospective bidders. The tabular statement of Annual Toll Revenue in the DPR read thus:  Bidders, after all, bid as per the projections contained in the bid documents. Profit is a legitimate expectation of every business enterprise, and loss of profit can constitute the basis to quantify damages, as held by the Supreme Court in A.T. Brij Paul Singh v. State of Gujarat51 . Pivotal, to the expectation of profit to be earned  through the CA, and the decision to opt for the Negative Grant or Positive Grant options thereunder, were the projections in the DPR. The recitals in the bid documents, too, held out the projections to be accurate. The decision, on the part of GMR, to opt for the Negative Grant structure, has also been guided by the said DPR projections. The Negative Grant option required GMR to invest a huge amount in the Project, to the tune of Rs 174.77 crores. To interpret the contract in such a manner as would not factor in the financial outlay of GMR, under the Negative Grant scheme, based on the DPR projections, while assessing whether the diversion of traffic and fall in toll collections consequent to the bypasses coming into being resulted in any Material Adverse Effect to GMR would, in my considered opinion, be contrary to plain commercial common sense.  51 (1984) 4 SCC 59",

The CA and SSA could not, therefore, be so construed as to ignore this paramount commercial consideration. The proscription against construction of a bypass, in Clause 8.1 of the CA and Clause 3.2 of the SSAs, has to be understood in this context. Activities which have resulted in the coming into existence of an alternate route, to the Project Highway, resulting in diversion of traffic from the Project Highway onto such alternate route and consequent financial loss to GMR cannot but be regarded as resulting in Material Adverse Effect to GMR. To hold that GMR is not entitled to be indemnified for the loss it suffers would be to  construe the CA and SSAs in a manner which is opposed to commercial common sense. Any such construction is, therefore, vulnerable to interference under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.",

These communications, as per GMR, practically vouchsafe its claims, as they acknowledge the fact that (i) the widening and strengthening of the ACRs resulted in their becoming ―bypasses‖ to the Project Highway, (ii) traffic, especially commercial traffic had, consequent thereupon, diverted to the said bypasses and (iii) resultantly, GMR had suffered considerable loss. Specifically, the claims of GMR were found, in the letter dated 26th August, 2010 from CGM-cum-Regional  officer to Member (Project) NHAI, to be genuine and merited. In the facts of the present case, the learned Arbitral Tribunal was not justified in disregarding the aforesaid communications, though addressed within NHAI from one officer to the other, as mere interdepartmental communications which were of no evidentiary value as no copy thereof had been forwarded to the GMR. In so holding, the learned Arbitral Tribunal failed to take stock of the fact that the Project Director and the CGM-cum-Regional Officer of NHAI, who had addressed the said communications, were specifically authorised during the meeting of NHAI held on 24th December 2009, to make their assessment and submit the recommendations to NHAI. This authorisation was, in turn, given consequent to the representation of GMR regarding development of alternate routes. In that view of the matter, the recommendations of the said officers could not have legitimately been ignored by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, as they were not mere inter-departmental communications, but were recommendations, consequent to the representation of GMR, by officers authorised by NHAI to make such recommendations.  53 (1996) 7 SCC 613  54 (2012) 7 SCC 288",

                        "content": "Though this Court holds the learned Arbitrators comprising the learned Arbitral Tribunal in the highest esteem and regard, yet, in view of the aforesaid discussion, this Court is of the opinion that the impugned Award cannot sustain, and the matter would have to be reexamined. The reasons for this conclusion, though already set out in extenso hereinabove, may, for ease of reference, be enumerated thus:  (i)  The learned Arbitral Tribunal had allowed GMR to inspect the records of NHAI. After such inspection, GMR identified twenty one documents/sets of documents which were necessary for the case that GMR proposed to set up. The relevance of the said documents has been highlighted in the written submissions filed in the present matter before this Court and stand enumerated in para 27.9 supra. The learned Arbitral Tribunal allowed the request of the petitioner and, vide order dated 7th October 2013 directed NHAI to file the said documents. The said direction was reiterated by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on 29th March 2014 and 13th September 2014. There is complete noncompliance, by NHAI, with the said direction. The arbitral proceedings could not have been allowed to continue and conclude without the said documents being made available to GMR, so that it could put up an effective case. This requirement is non-negotiable. It also flows directly from Section 18 of the 1996 Act, which requires all parties to be granted complete opportunity to represent their case. The Supreme Court has, in Associate Builders5 specifically held that denial of opportunity and, consequently, infraction of Section 18 of the 1996 Act, would render the Award contrary to the public policy of India. Such an Award is, therefore, liable to be set aside under Explanation 1(ii) to Section 34(2) of the 1996 Act.  (ii)  The opening findings of the learned Arbitral Tribunal, while interpreting the expression ―bypass‖ as contained in the passage reproduced in paras 17.3 and 17.4 supra are ―patently illegal‖ within the meaning of the expression as defined in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Associate Builders5 , Ssangyong26 , R.S Sharma9 , McDermott7 , Centro Trade Minerals8 , for the reasons set out in the various sub-paras of para 23 (from para 23.1 to para 23.7) supra.   (iii)  The learned Arbitral Tribunal has not taken into account all the material on record, to which para 21 supra in this judgment make reference. These materials, if taken into account, could have had a vital effect on the outcome of the proceedings. Applying the law enunciated in para 61 of Ssangyong26 , therefore, non-consideration of the said material also renders the Award liable to be interfered with and perverse in law.  (iv)  The submission of GMR with respect to Section 8A of the NH Act has also not been addressed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on the ground that fixation of the fees chargeable by GMR from the highway users was not a subject matter of controversy in the present case. For the reasons set out in the various sub-paras of para 27.2.6 of the present judgment, the non-consideration of the submission of GMR with respect to the applicability of the said provision vitiates the award, applying the law laid down in para 61 of Ssangyong26 .  (v)  The learned Arbitral Tribunal completely ignored the two reports of IMACS, consequent to the studies conducted in 29.09.2009 and December, 2012 respectively, on the ground that GMR had merely filed executive summaries of the reports and had not filed the complete reports. CW-1, in response to question no. 69 put to him, specifically confirmed that the executive summary which had been placed on record was an executive summary of the actual report of IMACS and undertook, should the learned Arbitral Tribunal require, to file the complete report. The learned Arbitral Tribunal never called upon GMR to file the complete report of IMACS. Inasmuch as the executive summary of the reports stood proved by the deposition of CW-1, in response to a query put to him in cross-examination, it was not open to the learned Arbitral Tribunal to reject the executive summary on the ground that it was unsigned or that the author of the summary had not come into the witness box. The learned Arbitral Tribunal has failed to take note of the aforesaid question no. 69 put to CW-1 and his response thereto. There are several decisions of the Supreme Court and other Courts in which the Courts have placed reliance on executive summaries of reports which were filed before them. The need to cite the said decisions is, however, obviated, as this objection of NHAI stands covered by the recent judgement of the Supreme Court in N.H.A.I. v. Madhukar Kumar55 . In that case, too, the entire DPR had not been produced before the Court, and what was placed was only  an executive summary. The Supreme Court held that, in the absence of any challenge to the correctness of the executive summary, ―the Court can proceed on the basis of the facts, which are brought out in the Report, and in the absence of a challenge to the same, proceed on the basis that, they are correct.‖ Reliance was, in fact, placed, by the Supreme Court, in that case, on the executive summary of the DPR, even by quoting, in extenso, the relevant portions thereof. The learned Arbitral Tribunal could not, therefore, in the present case, have brushed aside the executive summary of the report, consequent to the study conducted by IMACS as of no evidentiary value whatsoever.  55 2021 SCC OnLine SC 791  (vi)  The consequence of the manner in which the learned Arbitral Tribunal has proceeded is that GMR has been denied a fair opportunity of establishing its case. All parties are ad idem that the entire controversy in the present case revolves only around two issues, namely, (i) whether the States of Haryana and Punjab had constructed bypasses within the meaning of Clause 8.1 of the CA and Clause 3.2 of the concerned SSA and  (ii)  whether there had been diversion of traffic onto the said bypasses and resulted Material Adverse Effect on GMR. If the answers to both these questions are in the affirmative, GMR, ipso facto, would be entitled to be indemnified the loss suffered by it under Clause 37.1(2) of the CA. On this, there is no dispute.  (vii)  In order to prove that the upgradation and strengthening of the Shahabad-Panchkula highway had resulted in the creation of a bypass and diversion of traffic, earlier using the project highway, to the said bypass, the petitioner had placed reliance on several documents. The impugned Award, on one ground or the other, rejects the said material. The reports of IMACS have been disregarded on the ground that they were unsigned and were only in the nature of executive summaries. Inter-departmental communications of NHAI have been disregarded, which clearly bore out the case of the petitioner and acknowledged the fact that the changes carried out on SH-31 and NH-73 had resulted in diversion of traffic on to the said highway and consequent loss to GMR, on the ground that they are merely inter-departmental communications. The DPR which formed part of the bid document has been disregarded on the ground that there was a disclaimer clause, which forewarned bidders from relying on the traffic volume projections contained in the DPR. Apart from this, CW-1, in his affidavit in evidence as well as in his cross-examination, confirmed all aspects of the case of GMR and his evidence remained unshakable. In the mediation committee meeting dated 15th July 2010, which was chaired by the Chairperson of NHAI, it was candidly acknowledged that the upgradation of the Shahabad-Panchkula highway had resulted in diversion of traffic, though NHAI sought to transfer the burden in that regard to the shoulders of the State of Haryana. The assertions in this regard, as contained in the Statement of Claim filed by  GMR, were not specifically traversed in the Statement of Defence filed by NHAI. The communications dated 23rd July 2010 and 31st August 2010 from GMR to NHAI, also bore out the aforesaid facts, and were not traversed in the replies dated 17th August 2010 and 17th September 2010 from NHAI thereto.  (viii) The manner in which the Majority Award interprets the CA and SSAs is not in keeping with commercial common sense. This, therefore, amounts to ―patent illegality‖ within the meaning of Section 34 of the 1996 Act.",

These changes, it was pointed out, were effected by (a) widening & strengthening of Dera Bassi Surat Manauli Road (Lehli–Banur) (9+200 Km to 15+350 Km); (b) strengthening of Banur Tepla Road to Surat Manauli Road (Lehli – Banur) (RD 0.002 Km to 8.67 Km) and (c) widening and strengthening of Kharar Landran Banur Tepla Road (Section from 0+000 Km to 39+530 Km).

Equally, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had erred in holding that existing roads – in the present case, the road from Lehli to Banur or from Tepla to Kharar via Banur, at the time they were originally created as ―other district roads‖ were never contemplated as being bypasses and that, therefore, they could not be regarded as having become bypasses irrespective of their development. The learned Arbitral Tribunal also went on to hold, as in the case of OMP (Comm) 480/2020, that the road which was bypassed had necessarily to pre-date the bypass itself, and that an existing road could not become a bypass by subsequent development, widening or strengthening. All these findings, point out GMR, are presumptive in nature and could not constitute a justification to reject GMR‘s claim, once the effect of widening and strengthening of the stretches of highway in the Tepla-Banur-Kharar section and the Lehli-Banur road was found to be that traffic, earlier using the project highway, was diverting to the said stretches.",

This Court has been acutely conscious of the stature of the learned Arbitral Tribunal and especially of the learned Arbitrators, whom the Court holds in high regard and esteem. Their wisdom and knowledge is enviable and this Court pays all due respect thereto. The Court has been persuaded to  hold as it has only, primarily, because of four considerations. The first is that several documents, which GMR sought and the learned Arbitral Tribunal directed NHAI to produce, were never produced by NHAI. It seems, in the opinion of this Court, completely impermissible for NHAI to have done so and, nonetheless, invited no adverse inference against it. The second is that there appears, prima facie, material which has not been entirely appreciated by the learned Arbitral Tribunal which, keeping in mind the fact the principle that commercial contracts are required to be commercially construed, would require a fresh look, and may influence the ultimate outcome though, needless to say, this Court does not express any conclusive view thereon. The third is that the IMACS report has been disregarded from consideration largely because the original report was not produced before the learned Arbitral Tribunal and an Executive Summary thereof alone was placed on record. Given the position of law as now enunciated by the Supreme Court in Madhukar Kumar55 , and the fact that, in that case, too, the Supreme Court relied on an Executive Summary without the original report being placed before it, coupled with the offer, by CW-1, to produce the complete report, it appears that GMR ought to have been permitted a chance to place it on record in case the learned Arbitral Tribunal deemed it necessary to peruse the report. Needless to say, that opportunity would be available to GMR, should the need arise, in the de novo arbitral proceedings to be held consequent on this judgement. The fourth is that the communications dated 17th May 2010, 24th June 2010 and 26th August, 2010 addressed by the Project Director and the CGM-cum-Regional Officer of NHAI and the observations in the Mediation  Meeting dated 15th July, 2010 have been eschewed from consideration which, for the reasons already given hereinbefore, does not appear to this Court to have been justified.",
