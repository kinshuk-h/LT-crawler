The project was required to be completed within fifteen months i.e. by 10th April, 2019. However, because of the delays and disruptions occasioned on account of various acts of breach attributable to the respondent, the petitioner has suffered tremendous loss. He raised his claims before the respondent, but the same remained unaddressed. In terms of Clause 25 of the Agreement, the petitioner has already applied for the Pre-arbitration Dispute Resolution Procedure and agitated his claim before the Dispute Redressal Committee (DRC) which culminated in the publication of DRC's finding dated 08th January, 2021. However, the claims of the petitioner have remained  unaddressed by the DRC. The petitioner thus, issued a Notice dated 30th October, 2021 for commencement of Arbitration under Clause 25 of the Agreement. Furthermore, the procedure provided for constitution of Arbitral Tribunal under Clause 25 of the Agreement is contrary to the laws applicable to the independence and impartiality of the petitioners. The petitioner has nominated Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain (Retired), Punjab & Haryana High Court as its nominee Arbitrator and requested the respondent to either agree to his appointment as the Sole Arbitrator or appoint its own nominee Arbitrator, so that both the nominee Arbitrators may appoint the Presiding Arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings may be initiated.

The ratio of Parmar Construction Co. (supra) was applied by the Supreme Court in Union of India vs. Pradeep Vinod Construction Co. MANU/SC/1573/2019 to hold that the appointment of an Arbitrator should be in terms of the Agreement and an independent Arbitrator should not be appointed ignoring the Agreement between the parties.

It observed as under:  “Independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings. Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of natural justice which applied to all judicial and quasi-judicial relationship between the parties to the arbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in nature and the source of an arbitrator‟s appointment is deduced from the agreement entered into between the parties, notwithstanding the same non-independence and non-impartiality of such arbitrator (though contractually agreed upon) would render him ineligible to conduct the arbitration. The genesis behind this rational is that even when an arbitrator is appointed in terms of contract and by the parties to the contract, he is independent of the parties.  Functions and duties require him to rise above the partisan interest of the parties and not to act in, or so as to further, the particular interest of either parties. After all, the arbitrator has adjudicatory  role to perform and, therefore, he must be independent of parties as well as impartial.\"",

The petitioner has explained that though the work was completed in the month of July, 2015 but the final measurement was carried out after 10 months, multiple cables were laid down under the floor level and it could not be measured as to how much cable had been laid. Furthermore, EIL had withdrawn its representative before closure of the contract, and even before commissioning of the plan, which was also a major reason for incomplete measurements of cables. Also, there were multiple light fixtures and cable trays that were damaged by other multiple agencies working at the site. On the request of the EIL, damaged light fixtures were replaced with new light fixtures but no payment has been made to the petitioner resulting in additional loss to the petitioner. The petitioner is therefore, entitled to claim a total sum of Rs.27,38,50,034/-. Moreover, four bank guarantees are lying with the respondent.

The events that necessitated the filing of this application are that on 15.02.2022 a search u/s 132  of The Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter called 'The Act) was conducted by the officers of ITO at the Capital Cyberspace, Gurugran, Manesar, Urban Complex, Sector-59 office of M/s Huawei Telecommunications (India) Company Private Limited (in short the company'), wherein the books of accounts (as per the Form 3CD) were kept for the purpose of verification and determination of income chargeable to tax. During the course of search, applicant Xiongwei Li deliberately did not comply with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 132 of The Act. The officers of ITO were not given adequate facility and co-operation for inspection of books of accounts. Even the documents sought by the officers of ITO were not supplied by the applicant and other personnel of the company. The statement of the applicant was recorded u/s 132 (4) of The Act and apparently, the applicant deliberately chose to give vague answers to some of the questions, eflorts were made to confuse the authorized sate officers conducting the search. The answers given by the applicant and the other employees of the company were incongruous to each other.  Unnecessarily long time was sought by personnel of the company to furnish documents which otherwise ought to have been readily available with the company. The applicant is the CEO of the company but he did not comply with the directions issued by the officers of ITO. A complaint case was filed by the ITO against the company and its personnel (including the applicant) alleging commission of offence punishable u/s 275B r/w section 278B of the Act. It appears that pursuant to search conducted by ITO on 15.02.2022, a request for issuance of look out circular was made to the authority concerned by the Deputy Director of Income Tax (Inv) Unit 4(3), Delhi for issuance of lookout circular against the applicant.

It is submitted by the ld. counsel for the applicant that applicant was traveling to Bangkok to attend an internal meeting of the company but he was not able to reach Bangkok thereby dealing a huge blow to the reputation of the applicant as well as of the company. He contended the offence alleged to have been committed by the applicant is punishable with maximum imprisonment for a period of two years, so the same is non-cognizable and bailable, therefore an LOC could not have been opened with regard to this offence. He claimed that the LOC issued against the applicant is bad in law and the same is in violation of article 14 & 21 of The Constitution of India. He submitted that the LOC shall be quashed as the same is not issued as per the extant judicial pronouncements and circulars issued by the Union Government. Written submissions were placed on record by the applicant.  Reply to this application was filed by ITO wherein it informed that the investigation qua the company and its officers including the applicant is going on. It alleged that till date, all data and books of accounts sought from the company, its personnel and representatives have not been provided. It is also averred that the issue of arm's length price of related party transactions during the course of Transfer Pricing proceedings is being investigated and if may require re-examination of the applicant by the officers conducting investigation and may also result in filing of subsequent prosecution against company and/or its officials. He relied upon the statement of  Amit Kumar i.e. the Statutory Auditor of the company, to show that the data provided to the department is insufficient to reconcile the same with the financial statements of the company. He contended that in case the look out circular is withdrawn then the applicant being a Chinese national may leave India and never come back, thereby jeopardizing not only the proceedings in complaint case but also adversely affecting the investigation being conducted by the IT. He submitted that the application be dismissed being devoid of merit.  In compliance of an order passed by this court, the ITO placed on record (in closed envelope) copy of the letter written to the authority concerned for issuance of look out circular, the proforma for issuance of LOC and the proposal for issuance of LOC.  Submissions of the ld. SPP for (TO and Id. counsel for the applicant were heard at length on previous occasions. Entire material available on record has been perused. My observations on the application are delineated hereinafter.  The investigation regarding the search u/s 132 of The Act conducted at the office of the company is still in progress. No doubt, the complaint filed by the ITO before this court is for commission of offence punishable u/s 275 B read with 278B of The Act which is a non-cognizable and bailable offence. Except these two proceedings, no other criminal proceeding exists on date wherein the presence of applicant is required. ln Sumer Singh Salkan v. Asst. Director & Ors. 2010 (4) JCC 2401 while dealing with a reference sent by court of Ld. ACMM, Delhi, regarding LOC, the High Court of Delhi formulated the following questions:- a)  What are the categories of cases in which the investigating agency can seek recourse of Look-out-Circular and under what circumstances?  b)  What procedure is required to be followed by the investigating agency before opening a Look-out-Circular?  c)  What is the remedy available to the person against whom such Look-out-Circular has been opened?  d)  What is the role of the concerned Court when such a case is brought before it and under what circumstances the subordinate Courts can intervene?  The answers to these questions were provided by the High Court, which are reproduced in verbatim:- a)  Recourse to LOC can be taken by investigating agency in cognizable offences under IPC or other penal laws, where the accused was deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite NBWs and other coercive measures and there was likelihood of the accused leaving the country to evade trial/arrest.  b)  The Investigating Officer shall make a written request for LOC to the officer as notified by the circular of Ministry of Home Affairs, giving details & reasons for seeking LOC. The competent officer alone shall give directions for opening LOC by passing an order in this respect.  c)  The person against whom LOC is issued must join investigation by appearing before I.O. or should surrender before the court concerned or should  satisfy the court that LOC was wrongly issued against him. He may also approach the officer who ordered issuance of LOC & explain that LOC was wrongly issued against him. LOC can be withdrawn by the authority that issued and can also be rescinded by the trial court where case is pending or having jurisdiction over concerned police station on an application by the person concerned.  d) LOC is a coercive measure to make a person surrender to the investigating agency or Court of law. The subordinate courts jurisdiction in affirming or cancelling LOC is commensurate with the jurisdiction of cancellation of NBWs or affirming NBWs.  It is evident from perusal of the answers in the aforementioned reference that LOC can only be issued by investigating agency in case of cognizable offences under IPC or other penal laws on fulfilment of two conditions; (i) where the accused was deliberately not appearing before the court despite issuance of NBWs and other coercive measures or he was deliberately evading arrest, and (ii) there was likelihood of accused leaving the country to evade trials/arrests. Both these conditions are cumulative. Since, the complaint pending against the applicant is for commission of non-cognizable offence, therefore, the LOC could not have been issued citing that complaint. Moreover, no coercive process was issued against the applicant by this court, rather a summon for appearance was ordered to be issued.  Perusal of letter written to the authority concerned by officer of ITO for issuance of LOC against applicant shows that the officer was of prima facie view that commission of other offences under  the Act was disclosed and thorough investigation was required to be conducted. The applicant being the CEO of the company would be required to appear before the investigating officer for purpose of investigation. The reason for issuance of LOC seems to be to ensure that the applicant does not escape from India. Hence, it appears from the documents produced in closed envelope that LOC was issued not due to the pendency of the complaint case but for reason of ongoing investigation against the company.  It is not the case of the ITO that the applicant did not appear before the investigating officer as and when directed to do so. It is also not the case that the applicant was trying to evade the arrest. In fact, in the complaint case the applicant appeared and was admitted to bail. He made a statement before the court that he shall inform the concerned officer of ITO at least seven days prior to leaving India in the event of quashing of LOC by the court.  The view expressed in the case of Sumer Singh Salkan (supra), was incorporated by FRRO in Office Memorandum dated 27.10.2010. This office memorandum has been amended by Office Memorandum No. 25016/10/2017 -IMM dated. 05.12.2017 which made the following additional to the extant guidelines:  In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued even in such cases, as would not be covered by the guidelines above, whereby departure of a person from India may be declined at the request of any of the authorities mentioned in Clause (b) of the above-referred OM, if it appears to such authority based on inputs received that the departure of such person is detrimental to the sovereignty or  security or integrity of India or that the same is detrimental to the bilateral relations with any country or to the strategic and/or economic interest of India or if such person is allowed to leave, he may potentially indulge in an act of terrorism or offences against the State and/or that such departure ought not be permitted in the larger public interest at any given point of time.  The applicant does not come within this additional criteria, as the departure of applicant cannot be stated to be detrimental to sovereignty, security and integrity of India, it is also not detrimental to bilateral relations with any other country or to strategic and/or economic interest of India. It is highly unlikely that the applicant will indulge in act of terrorism or offence against Indian state. Thus, an apprehension that the applicant may leave India and may never come back cannot be ground to keep him in India till the culmination of all legal proceedings, which may emanate from the search conducted on 15.02.2022. As such, legal proceedings are likely to take a long time to conclude. It has already been six months since the issuance of letter of request for opening of LOC against applicant and the investigation appears to be nowhere near completion. There is a likelihood that the applicant may leave India on the pretext of some business meeting or any personal work and may never come back but this possibility of absconding is always there whenever any person is admitted to bail in any criminal case. In Rana Ayyub v. Union of India & Anr. W.P.(CRL)714/2022 decided on 04.04.2022 the High Court of Delhi quashed the LOC as there was no cogent reason to presume that the petitioner would not appear before the  investigating agency. The applicant is also entitled to equality before the law. The applicant cannot be treated differently solely on the ground of his nationality and cannot be restricted from international travel by issuance of LOC, when Indian Nationals facing legal proceedings in more serious offence are allowed to travel outside India.  The company is not a fly by night operator and considering the fact that it generates considerable revenue from India, it is prudent that a condition be imposed upon payment of salary, bonus, ESOPs and other benefits to the applicant by the accused company, so as to exercise some degree of control over him. There is no ground to keep the LOC open against the applicant and the LOC against the applicant is liable to be set aside. At this juncture, it is apposite to advert to the observation made by High Court of Delhi in Shri Sathish Babu Sana v. Central Bureau Of Investigation W.P.(CRL) 249/2019 decided on 28.01.2022:-",

                        "content": "The petitioner thus satisfies the test laid down by this Court in Sumer Singh Salkan (supra) as he has neither deliberately evaded arrest nor failed to appear before the Trial Court despite the non-bailable warrants nor has any coercive action been taken against him and he has travelled abroad number of times with the permission of the Court, which concession he did not misuse and therefore there is no justification in continuing with the LOC opened against the petitioner. Hence the respondent is directed to recall its request for opening the LOC against the petitioner. It is further directed that that the petitioner will continue to join the investigation as  and when directed by the Investigating Officer and any condition that is imposed by the learned Special Judge in the complaint lodged pursuant to the ECIR, when the petitioner seeks permission to travel abroad will also be applicable in the abovenoted RC No.224/2017/A-001, till the charge-sheet is filed and thereafter, if the petitioner is charge-sheeted and summoned as an accused.  From the perusal of the aforementioned extract, it is evident that the court at the time of quashing the LOC may impose conditions upon the applicant. This court is cognizant of the fact that the applicant does not have any movable or immovable assets in India except his bank account. Moreover, none of the family members and relatives of the applicant permanently reside in India, hence, there is little incentive for the applicant to come to India once he leaves the country with an intent to not return back. It is also doubtful 'whether the sureties would be in a position to compel the applicant to come to India should he decide against coming back for facing prosecution in complaint case or for appearing before the investigating officer. In these circumstances, it is ordered that in case of resignation, retirement or cessation of employment etc. of the applicant, the company shall withhold the Severance Pay/Severance Package and other incentives/emoluments payable to applicant and the same shall not be released without prior permission of this court. An undertaking to this effect shall be procured by the applicant from the company and the same shall be filed with this court under intimation to Deputy Director of Income Tax (Inv) Unit-4(3), Delhi.  Upon filing of undertaking, DDIT (Inv) Unit4(3), Delhi shall take appropriate steps for withdrawing the lookout circular against the applicant and the same shall be withdrawn/recalled within 7 days of filing of undertaking by the applicant. The application stands disposed of.  Copy of this order be given dasti, free of cost to both the parties.”",

Considering the gravity of charges levelled against the Petitioner/A2 in Crime No. 304 of 2012 by the Respondents and in view of the Guideline No. 8(j) of the Office Memorandum dated 27.10.2010 (relating to the issuance of LOC in respect of Indian citizen and foreigners) by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) based on the existing practice, even though the LOC dated 06.10.2012 opened for a year against the Petitioner for a period from 06.10.2012 to 05.10.2013 was extended for six months till 26.05.2014 by the Bureau of Immigration, (MHA), Government of India, Chennai -6 through communication dated 27.01.2014 (which is beyond the period of one year from the date of issue), yet, the extension of LOC dated 27.01.2014 for a further period of six months till 26.05.2014 and the earlier LOC issued on 06.10.2012 for a period of one year (in respect of the Petitioner) are valid and tenable ones, in the considered opinion of this Court. Certainly, the Respondents can take recourse to the issuance of LOC to prevent likelihood of the Petitioner/A2 leaving the country to evade trial. After all, the said LOC is nothing but coercive tool enabling the Petitioner either to surrender before the Investigating Agency or to co-operate with the Investigating Agency in regard to the pending completion of investigation in Crime No. 304 of 2012.  Further, the Petitioner/A2 comes within the ambit of the term „exceptional case/cases‟ and therefore, there is no impediment in law for the concerned authorities to issue LOC against him without complete parameters.”,  to submit to the effect that even during pending investigation, the LOC was upheld by invoking the category of exceptional circumstances submitting to the effect that the said case was a case where the petitioner was arrayed as an accused for dealing in lottery tickets which were banned in Tamil Nadu and for keeping the unaccounted and unlawfully acquired money.",

Inter alia, the petitioner has further submitted that vide the impugned order, the learned Trial court had observed that the facts of the case do not support the conclusion that there was any detriment to the economic security of  the State, however the detailed facts mentioned therein would clearly convey the opposite. The petitioner has also placed reliance on the observations of the Hon‟ble Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.78/2022 in “Income Tax Department v. Vikas Choudhary”, an order dated 03.02.2022, wherein, it has been observed to the effect:- \"Ongoing investigation has revealed that there are proposed additions upwards of Rs.14,83,93,68,372/and penalties upwards of Rs.2,66,13,000/-. It is also submitted that the Appellant is investigating into the offences under the Black Money {Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 and has submitted FT& TR references to the authorities in Dubai and under special enactments such as this Act, an FIR is not a pre-requisite for commencement of the investigation and on a complaint being filed, it is treated as a complaint case. It is thus urged by the learned counsel for the Appellant that if the impugned judgment quashing the LOC is not stayed, grave prejudice shall be caused to the investigation and if Respondent No.1 is permitted to travel abroad, it shall be detrimental to the core economic interests of the country and will be a contravention of the very object for which OMs dated 05.12.2017 and 22.02.2021 have been issued. It is emphasised that the OM dated 05.12.2017 was issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home A/fairs-Foreigners Division {Immigration Section), amending the OM dated 27.10.2010 and expanding its scope to issue LOCs against persons impacting the economic interests of India and the OM dated 22.02.2021 was issued laying down fresh Guidelines for issuance of LOCs and it is clearly stipulated therein that no LOC shall be deleted automatically and shall remain in force till a deletion request is received from the  Originator. Learned Senior Counsels appearing for Respondent No.1, on the other hand, refute the contentions of the Appellant and submit that the Learned Single Judge has rightly quashed the LOC. It is also submitted that Respondent No.1 is a businessman and is required to travel frequently for the conduct of his business and there is no question of his fleeing from the country or evading the process of law. It is also submitted that a detailed reply shall be filed by Respondent No.1, which will bring forth the falsity of the stand of the Appellant, including the fact that the figures cited by them are highly exaggerated. Having heard the learned counsel for the Appellant and the learned Senior Counsels for Respondent No.1, in our view, Appellant has made out a prima facie case for grant of interim relief. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the Appellant and in case the impugned judgment is not stayed, irreparable loss shall be caused to the Appellant. We, accordingly, stay the operation, implementation and execution of the impugned judgment dated 12.01.2022, passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) 5374/2021, till the next date of hearing. Respondent No.1 is hereby directed to deposit his passport with the learned Registrar General of this Court, latest by 5.00 PM on 04.02.2022. The passport shall be kept by the Learned Registrar General in safe custody in a sealed cover.\"",

The petitioner has reiterated the reliance on the verdict of the Division Bench of this Court, in LPA 78/2022, and order dated 3.2.2022 therein already referred to herein above.

The respondent submits that after the search was conducted the petitioner was not even summoned once and submits that the LOC in the instant case has been rightly quashed. Reliance was placed on behalf of the respondent on the verdict of the Hon‟ble Supreme  Court in MCD Vs. State of Delhi; (2005) 4 Supreme Court Cases 605 wherein it was observed vide para 21 to the effect:  “21. This apart, the respondent did not also disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the High Court that he has also been convicted in another Criminal Case No. 202 of 1997 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi. Thus, the contesting respondent has come to the High Court with unclean hands and withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side. In our opinion, he would be guilty of playing fraud on the Court as well as on the opposite party. A person whose case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. We have no hesitation to say that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the court and he can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. In the instant case, non-production of the order and even non-mentioning of the conviction and sentence in Criminal Case No. 202 of 1997 tantamounts to playing fraud on the Court. A litigant who approaches the court is bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the litigation. If he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite party. The second respondent, in our opinion, was not justified in suppressing the material fact that he was convicted by the Magistrate on an earlier occasion. Since the second respondent deliberately suppressed the crucial and important fact, we disapprove strongly and particularly, the conduct of the second respondent and by reason of such conduct, the  second respondent disentitled himself from getting any relief or assistance from this Court. We, however, part with this case with a heavy heart expressing our strong disapproval of the conduct and behaviour but direct that the second respondent to pay a sum of Rs 10,000 by way of cost to the appellant herein.”",

Vide the said order it was observed as under:- ““By this order, I shall dispose of an application filed on behalf of applicant Xiongwei Li for quashing of look out circular (LOC) issued against him at the request of Income Tax Office (ITO).  The events that necessitated the filing of this application are that on 15.02.2022 a search u/s 132 of The Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter called „The Act‟) was conducted by the officers of ITO at the Capital Cyberspace, Gurugran, Manesar, Urban Complex, Sector-59 office of M/s Huawei Telecommunications (India) Company Private Limited (in short „the company‟), wherein the books of accounts (as per the Form 3CD) were kept for the purpose of verification and determination of income chargeable to tax. During the course of search, applicant Xiongwei Li deliberately did not comply with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 132 of The Act. The officers of ITO were not given adequate facility and co-operation for inspection of books of accounts. Even the documents sought by the officers of ITO were not supplied by the applicant and other personnel of the company. The statement of the applicant was recorded u/s 132 (4) of The Act  and apparently, the applicant deliberately chose to give vague answers to some of the questions, eflorts were made to confuse the authorized sate officers conducting the search. The answers given by the applicant and the other employees of the company were incongruous to each other.  Unnecessarily long time was sought by personnel of the company to furnish documents which otherwise ought to have been readily available with the company. The applicant is the CEO of the company but he did not comply with the directions issued by the officers of ITO. A complaint case was filed by the ITO against the company and its personnel (including the applicant) alleging commission of offence punishable u/s 275B r/w section 278B of the Act. It appears that pursuant to search conducted by ITO on 15.02.2022, a request for issuance of look out circular was made to the authority concerned by the Deputy Director of Income Tax (Inv) Unit 4(3), Delhi for issuance of lookout circular against the applicant. On 01.05.2022 when applicant went to Delhi airport to board a Thai Airways International Flight for traveling to Bangkok, he was not allowed to board the flight and was later informed that a look out circular was issued against him. By moving the present application, the applicant seeks quashing of that look out circular.  It is submitted by the ld. counsel for the applicant that applicant was traveling to Bangkok to attend an internal meeting of the company but he was not able to reach Bangkok thereby dealing a huge blow to the reputation of the applicant as well as of the company. He contended the offence alleged to have been committed by the applicant is punishable with maximum imprisonment for a period of two years, so the same is non-cognizable and  bailable, therefore an LOC could not have been opened with regard to this offence. He claimed that the LOC issued against the applicant is bad in law and the same is in violation of article 14 & 21 of The Constitution of India. He submitted that the LOC shall be quashed as the same is not issued as per the extant judicial pronouncements and circulars issued by the Union Government. Written submissions were placed on record by the applicant.  Reply to this application was filed by ITO wherein it informed that the investigation qua the company and its officers including the applicant is going on. It alleged that till date, all data and books of accounts sought from the company, its personnel and representatives have not been provided. It is also averred that the issue of arm' length price of related party transactions during the course of Transfer Pricing proceedings is being investigated and if may require re-examination of the applicant by the officers conducting investigation and may also result in filing of subsequent prosecution against company and/or its officials. He relied upon the -statement of Lalit Kumar i.e. the Statutory Auditor of the company, to show that the data provided to the department is insufficient to reconcile the same with the financial statements of the company. He contended that in case the look out circular is withdrawn then the applicant being a Chinese national may leave India and never come back, thereby jeopardizing not only the proceedings in complaint case but also adversely affecting the investigation being conducted by the ITO. He submitted that the application be dismissed being devoid of merit.  In compliance of an order passed by this court, the ITO placed on record (in closed envelope) copy of the letter written to the authority concerned for issuance of look out circular, the proforma for  issuance of LOC and the proposal for issuance of LOC.  Submissions of the ld. SPP for (TO and Id. counsel for the applicant were heard at length on previous occasions. Entire material available on record has been perused. My observations on the application are delineated hereinafter.  The investigation regarding the search us 132 of The Act conducted at the office of the company is still in progress. No doubt, the complaint filed by the ITO before this court is for commission of offence punishable u/s 275 B read with 278B of The Act which is a non-cognizable and bailable offence. Except these two proceedings, no other criminal proceeding exists on date wherein the presence of applicant is required. ln Sumer Singh Salkan v. Asst. Director & Ors. 2010 (4) JCC 2401 while dealing with a reference sent by court of Ld. ACMM, Delhi, regarding LOC, the High Court of Delhi formulated the following questions:- a)  What are the categories of cases in which the investigating agency can seek recourse of Look-out-Circular and under what circumstances?  b)  What procedure is required to be followed by the investigating agency before opening a Look-out-Circular?  c)  What is the remedy available to the person against whom such Look-out-Circular has been opened?  d)  What is the role of the concerned Court when such a case is brought before it and under what circumstances the subordinate Courts can intervene?  The answers to these questions were provided by the High Court, which are reproduced in verbatim:- a)  Recourse to LOC can be taken by investigating agency in cognizable offences under IPC or other penal laws, where the accused was deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite NBWs and other coercive measures and there was likelihood of the accused leaving the country to evade trial/arrest.  b)  The Investigating Officer shall make a written request for LOC to the officer as notified by the circular of Ministry of Home Affairs, giving details & reasons for seeking LOC. The competent officer alone shall give directions for opening LOC by passing an order in this respect.  c)  The person against whom LOC is issued must join investigation by appearing before I.O. or should surrender before the court concerned or should satisfy the court that LOC was wrongly issued against him. He may also approach the officer who ordered issuance of LOC & explain that LOG was wrongly issued against him. LOC can be withdrawn by the authority that issued and can also be rescinded by the trial court where case is pending or having jurisdiction over concerned police station on an application by the person concerned.  d)  LOC is a coercive measure to make a person surrender to the investigating agency or Court of law. The subordinate courts jurisdiction in affirming or cancelling LOC is commensurate with the jurisdiction of cancellation of NBWs or affirming NBWs.  It is evident from perusal of the answers in the aforementioned reference that LOC can only be issued by investigating agency in case of cognizable offences under IPC or other penal laws on fulfilment of two conditions; (i) where the accused was deliberately not appearing before the court despite issuance of NBWs and other coercive measures or he was deliberately evading arrest, and (ii) there was likelihood of accused leaving the country to evade trials/arrests. Both these conditions are cumulative. Since, the complaint pending against the applicant is for commission of non-cognizable offence, therefore, the LOC could not have been issued citing that complaint. Moreover, no coercive process was issued against the applicant by this court, rather a summon for appearance was ordered to be issued.  Perusal of letter written to the authority concerned by officer of ITO for issuance of LOC against applicant shows that the officer was of prima facie view that commission of other offences under the Act was disclosed and thorough investigation was required to be conducted. The applicant being the CEO of the company would be required to appear before the investigating officer for purpose of investigation. The reason for issuance of LOC seems to be to ensure that the applicant does not escape from India. Hence, it appears from the documents produced in closed envelope that LOC was issued not due to the pendency of the complaint case but for reason of ongoing investigation against the company.  It is not the case of the ITO that the applicant did not appear before the investigating officer as and when directed to do so. Tt is also not the case that the applicant was trying to evade the arrest. In fact, in the complaint case the applicant appeared and was admitted to bail. He made a statement before the court that he shall inform the concerned officer of  ITO at least seven days prior to leaving India in the event of quashing of LOC by the court.  The view expressed in the case of Sumer Singh Salkan (supra), was incorporated by FRRO in Office Memorandum dated 27.10.2010. This office memorandum has been amended by Office Memorandum No. 25016/10/2017 -IMM dated. 05.12.2017 which made the following additional to the extant guidelines:  In exceptional cases, LOCs can be issued even in such cases, as would not be covered by the guidelines above, whereby departure of a person from India may be declined at the request of any of the authorities mentioned in Clause (b) of the above-referred OM, if it appears to such authority based on inputs received that tile departure of such person is detrimental to the sovereignty or security or integrity of India or that the same is detrimental to tile bilateral relations witl1 any country or to the strategic and/or economic interest of India or if such person is allowed to leave, he may potentially indulge in an act of terrorism or offences against the State and/or that such departure ought not be permitted in the larger public interest at any given point of time.  The applicant does not come within this additional criteria, as the departure of applicant cannot be stated to be detrimental to sovereignty, security and integrity of India, it is also not detrimental to bilateral relations with any other country or to strategic and/or economic interest of India. It is highly unlikely that the applicant will  indulge in act of terrorism or offence against Indian state. Thus, an apprehension that the applicant may leave India and may never come back cannot be ground to keep him in India till the culmination of all legal proceedings, which may emanate from the search conducted on 15.02.2022. As such, legal proceedings are likely to take a long time to conclude. It has already been six months since the issuance of letter of request for opening of LOC against applicant and the investigation appears to be nowhere near completion. There is a likelihood that the applicant may leave India on the pretext of some business meeting or any personal work and may never come back but this possibility of absconding is always there whenever any person is admitted to bail in any criminal case. In Rana Ayyub v. Union of India & Anr. W.P.(CRL)714/2022 decided on 04.04.2022 the High Court of Delhi quashed the LOC as there was no cogent reason to presume that the petitioner would not appear before the investigating agency. The applicant is also entitled to equality before the law. The applicant cannot be treated differently solely on the ground of his nationality and cannot be restricted from international travel by issuance of LOC, when Indian Nationals facing legal proceedings in more serious offence are allowed to travel outside India.  The company is not a fly by night operator and considering the fact that it generates considerable revenue from India, it is prudent that a condition be imposed upon payment of salary, bonus, ESOPs and other benefits to the applicant by the accused company, so as to exerci.se some degree of control over him. There is no ground to keep the LOC open against the applicant and the LOC against the applicant is liable to be set aside. At this juncture, it is apposite to advert to the observation made by High Court of Delhi in Shri Sathish Babu Sana v.  Central Bureau Of Investigation W.P.(CRL) 249/2019 decided on 28.01.2022:-",

                        "content": "The petitioner thus satisfies the test laid down by this Court in Sumer Singh Salkan (supra) as he has neither deliberately evaded arrest nor failed to appear before the Trial Court despite the non-bailable warrants nor has any coercive action been taken against him and he has travelled abroad number of times with the permission of the Court, which concession he did not misuse and therefore there is no justification in continuing with the LOC opened against the petitioner. Hence the respondent is directed to recall its request for opening the LOC against the petitioner. It is further directed that that the petitioner will continue to join the investigation as and when directed by the Investigating Officer and any condition that is imposed by the learned Special Judge in the complaint lodged pursuant to the ECIR, when the petitioner seeks permission to travel abroad will also be applicable in the abovenoted RC No.224/2017/A-001, till the charge-sheet is filed and thereafter, if the petitioner is charge-sheeted and summoned as an accused.  From the perusal of the aforementioned extract, it is evident that the court at the time of quashing the LOC may impose conditions upon the applicant. This court is cognizant of the fact that the applicant does not have any movable or immovable assets in India except his bank account. Moreover, none of the family members and relatives of the  applicant permanently reside in India, hence, there is little incentive for the applicant to come to India once he leaves the country with an intent to not return back. It is also doubtful 'whether the sureties would be in a position to compel the applicant to come to India should he decide against coming back for facing prosecution in complaint case or for appearing before the investigating officer. In these circumstances, it is ordered that in case of resignation, retirement or cessation of employment etc. of the applicant, the company shall withhold the Severance Pay/Severance Package and other incentives/emoluments payable to applicant and the same shall not be released without prior permission of this court. An undertaking to this effect shall be procured by the applicant from the company and the same shall be filed with this court under intimation to Deputy Director of Income Tax (Inv) Unit-4(3), Delhi.  Upon filing of undertaking, DDIT (Inv) Unit4(3), Delhi shall take appropriate steps for withdrawing the lookout circular against the applicant and the same shall be withdrawn/recalled within 7 days of filing of undertaking by the applicant. The application stands disposed of.  Copy of this order be given dasti, free of cost to both the parties.”",

(iii)  Plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant no.3 for supplying Fuel Gas Conditioning Systems and Water Bath Heaters.  (iv)  Pursuant to the aforesaid agreement, upon the request of the defendant no.3, an irrevocable Letter of Credit (L/C) bearing no.110379ILCU00048 was issued in favour of the plaintiff by the defendant no.2 on 17th October, 2011 for a sum of Rs.2,91,89,198/-.  (v)  In the said L/C, the advising bank was Canara Bank, New Delhi.  (vi)  Pursuant to a purchase order from the defendant no.3, the plaintiff dispatched certain materials to the defendant no.3 under two separate invoices dated 4th February, 2012. The material was duly received by the defendant no.3 and the amount payable against the said invoices was Rs.1,02,75,660/-.  (vii)  Plaintiff submitted relevant documents for collection of payment against the aforesaid L/C to its banker, Canara Bank, on 8th February, 2012.  (viii)  On 13th February, 2012, the said documents were submitted by Canara Bank to the defendant no.2.  (ix)  Defendant no.2 vide its communication dated 25th February, 2012 to Canara Bank refused to accept the aforesaid documents.  (x)  The defendant no.3 wrote a letter dated 28th February, 2012 to the defendant no.2, referencing the letter dated 25th February, 2012 and accepting the documents sent to the defendant no.2 and confirming the debit of Rs.1,08,59,472/-.  (xi)  Despite the letter from the defendant no.3 waiving the discrepancy in the documents, the defendant no.2 failed to make payment under the L/C.  (xii)  Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants no. 1 and 2 under the Reserve Bank of India Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 on 20th September, 2013. However, the said complaint was rejected on 8th October, 2013.

Therefore, no cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court.  (ii)  The present suit is barred by limitation. In the present case, the L/C in terms of which recovery is sought expired on 16th March, 2012 and the present suit has been filed only on 7th September, 2015. Therefore, the present suit is barred under Article 31 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963. Further, the original of the documents were returned on behalf of the defendant no.2 on 29th August, 2012. Taking into the said date also, the present suit is barred by limitation.  (iii)  The plaintiff failed to submit the requisite documents in accordance with the L/C and therefore, the defendant no.2 validly rejected the documents and did not make the payment under the L/C. The waiver from the defendant no.3 was received belatedly by the defendant no.2. Further, the defendant no.2 was not under an obligation to accept the documents under the L/C even if there was a waiver by the defendant no.3. Reliance in this regard is placed on the terms of Article 16 of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 600 (UCP 600).  (iv)  The present suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary party. The plaintiff has failed to make Canara Bank, which was advising bank, as a party in the present suit.",

In this regard, reliance is placed on the L/C document, which shows that the place of expiry of the L/C is the place of the negotiating bank i.e., the Canara Bank, New Delhi. Further, various discussions were held between the plaintiff and the officials of the defendant no.2 at its office in New Delhi. Reliance in this regard is made to the letter dated 11th September, 2012 (page 47 of the documents filed by the plaintiff) and the response dated 24th September, 2012 by the Delhi office of the defendant bank (page 51 of the documents filed by the plaintiff). In support of his submission, reliance is placed of this Court in IUP Jindal Metals & Alloys Ltd. v. M/s. Conee Chains Private Ltd., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1454.  (ii)  The present suit has been filed within the prescribed period of limitation. In the present case, the limitation would commence from 6th September, 2012, the date on which Canara Bank received the letter dated 29th August, 2012 from the defendant no.2, refusing to honour the documents and returning the original documents. If the limitation is calculated from the aforesaid date, the suit is within the period of limitation.  (iii)  Defendant no.2 was bound to accept the documents and make the payments under the L/C in view of the waiver given by the defendant no.3 vide its letter dated 28th February, 2012 (page 39 of the documents filed by the plaintiff). In its letter dated 25th February, 2012 (page 37 of the documents filed by the plaintiff) of the  documents filed by the plaintiff), the defendant no.2, while point out the discrepancies in the documents, had accepted that if a waiver is received from the defendant no.3, the defendant no.2 would make the payment under the L/C. It has wrongly been stated in the communication dated 25th August, 2012 (page 41 of the documents filed by the plaintiff) by the defendant no.2 that they did not receive the waiver from the defendant no.3. In the leave to defend application, it has been specifically admitted that the waiver was received from the defendant no.3.  (iv)  The defendant no.2 completely changed its stand in its communication dated 28th August, 2012, wherein it is stated that they will make the payment only upon funds being arranged by the defendant no.3 into their account. The aforesaid submission completely defeats the purpose of an L/C. The defendant no.2 was bound to accept the waiver given by the defendant no.3 and pursuant thereto, make payments under the L/C.

(ii)  Even if there is a waiver given by the defendant no.3, it is not obligatory upon the bank to accept the documents and make the payment. In any case, the waiver of the defendant no.3 was received after a period of five days, the period within which the bank had to convey its stand with regard to the acceptance of the documents under the L/C.

In the present case also, the registered office of the plaintiff is in Delhi and the legal notice was issued from Delhi.

Reliance is placed by the counsel for the plaintiff on the letter issued by the defendant no.3 on 28th February, 2012, whereby the defendant no.3 accepted the documents with the noted discrepancies and confirmed to debit the amount claimed under the suit. In response, counsel for the defendants no.1 and 2 has relied upon the terms of Article 16 of UCP 600, which governs the present L/C. The relevant parts of Article 16 are set out hereinafter:  “Discrepant Documents, Waiver and Notice  a.  When a nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may refuse to honour or negotiate.  b.  When an issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may in its sole judgement approach the applicant for a waiver of the discrepancies. This does not, however, extend the period mentioned in sub-article 14 (b).  c.  When a nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank decides to refuse to honour or negotiate, it must give a single notice to that effect to the presenter.  The notice must state:  i.  that the bank is refusing to honour or negotiate; and  ii.  each discrepancy in respect of which the bank refuses to honour or negotiate; and  iii.  a)  that the bank is holding the documents pending further instructions from the presenter; or  b)  that the issuing bank is holding the documents until it receives a waiver from the applicant and agrees to accept it, or receives further instructions from the presenter prior to agreeing to accept a waiver; or  c)  that the bank is returning the documents; or  d)  that the bank is acting in accordance with instructions previously received from the presenter.  d.  The notice required in sub-article 16 (c) must be given by telecommunication or, if that is not possible, by other expeditious means no later than the close of the fifth banking day following the day of presentation,  e.  A nominated bank acting on its nomination, a confirming bank, if any, or the issuing bank may, after providing notice required by sub-article 16 (c) (iii) (a) or (b), return the documents to the presenter at any time.  f.  If an issuing bank or a confirming bank fails to act in accordance with the provisions of this article, it shall be precluded from claiming that the documents do not constitute a complying presentation.  g.  When an issuing bank refuses to honour or a confirming bank refuses to honour or negotiate and has given notice to that effect in accordance with this article, it shall then be entitled to claim a refund, with interest, of any reimbursement made.”",

This was to be paid in equal share by each of the parties. The parties seem to have accepted this without demur. Till the end of January 2022, the Claimant had paid Rs. 12.90 lacs to the presiding arbitrator and Rs. 18.90 to each of the two arbitrators. Pursuant to the direction given on 31.01.2022, the Claimant deposited Rs. 3 lacs with the three arbitrators.  Till 09.12.2021, the Respondent had paid to each of the Arbitrators gross amount of only Rs. 15 lacs less TDS. Thereafter, the Respondent has not even paid Rs. 3 lacs to any members of the Tribunal as directed on 31.02.2022. It is pointed out by the Ld. Co-Arbitrators that the Respondent has also not deposited the full amount of charges for administrative expense and that  Rs. 50,000/-is due and payable by the Respondent to each of the two Co-Arbitrators.  In the record of proceedings dated 25.01.2021 it was noted that the parties had deposited, with the Ld. CoArbitrators various amounts adding up toRs. 16,50,000. This was a mistake because the deposit fees made till then was as noted above. On 25.01.2021, direction was also given to the parties to make good shortfall of fees payable to the Ld. Co-Arbitrators. This has not been complied with so far.  In view of the above, it has become imperative to pass a specific order with regard to payment of fees by the parties to the Arbitrators. The Claimant is directed to make good the shor(fall of Rs. 6 Lacs as compared to the Respondent and pay the same to the presiding arbitrator. Further, the Respondent has been remiss and negligent in paying its share of fees and administrative expenses to the three arbitrators. They are now specifically directed to pay to each of the Arbitrators Rs. 3.9 lac to match the payment made by the Claimant as noticed above. Further, they must comply with the direction made on 31.01.2022 about payment of Rs. 3 lacs to each of the three arbitrators. All these payment, as directed above, must be made by parties within two weeks from today, i.e., by 15.03.2022.  The Respondent will be well advised to pay the fees as directed, failing which the Tribunal will be constrained to hold that the counter claim of the Respondent will not be considered and/or adjudicated upon . ...”",

The parties are the appointing authority and fee, if provided in the Arbitration Agreement is part of the terms of appointment and is binding. The Supreme Court in NHAI v. Gayatri Jhansi Roadways Ltd, (2020) 17 SCC 626, while considering two conflicting judgments passed by two co-ordinate benches of the this Court in Gayatri Jhansi Roadways Ltd. (supra) (relied upon by the Tribunal to fix its own fee) and NHAI v. Gammon Engineers and Contractors Ltd, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 10183, held that the law laid down by the Single Judge of this Court in Gayatri Jhansi Roadways (supra) is not a correct view of the law. The Supreme Court held that the Tribunal was bound to charge fee as per the agreement between the parties and cannot charge anything contrary to it. It was held that the arbitrator‟s fees may be a component of costs to be paid but it is a far cry thereafter to state that Section 31 (8) and 31-A of the Act would directly govern contracts in which fee structure has already been laid down. When the Agreement lays down the fee to be paid or the rules to be followed, in the present case, the ICADR Rules, then the same forms an integral part of the  terms of appointment. The Tribunal is bound by the arbitration agreement between the parties, which is the source of its power. The Tribunal cannot accept the appointment in part and rewrite the arbitration agreement between the parties. This Court in the matter of NTPC v. Amar India OMP (T) (Comm.) No. 13/2020, held where a Tribunal decides to charge a higher fee which is not as per the Arbitration Agreement, then the Tribunal has not accepted its appointment and has in fact varied the terms of the appointment and is thus, de jure unable to perform its functions.",

An arbitrator will not usually be entitled to increase his fees and expenses unless his agreement with the parties allows him to do so. Previously, attempts to increase fee have led to allegations of bias and of what used to be called misconduct, and could, if pursued unreasonably, lead to an application to remove the arbitrator and even to challenge of any award made by him because of breach of the duty to avoid unnecessary expenses”  He has also submitted that Gary B Born in International Commercial Arbitration (Second Edition, 2014) states that the amount of an arbitrator‟s remuneration is a matter of contract, which the parties and arbitrator should negotiate and agree upon. Accordingly, once an arbitrator has accepted an assignment pursuant to an arbitration agreement between the parties and the said agreement provides for the fee payable to such arbitrator or the Rules to be followed, the same is  binding and the arbitrator cannot unilaterally charge higher fee than agreed upon and accepted by the arbitrator. In this regard, he has also placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Delhi State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation v. Bawana Infra Development (P) Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 9241 and Jivanlal Jotiram Patel v.

Singh Builders Syndicate, (2009) 4 SCC 523, observed “…….if a high fee is claimed by the arbitrator and one party agrees to pay such fee, the other party, who is unable to afford such fee or reluctant to pay such high fee, is put to an embarrassing position. He will not be in a position to express his reservation or objection to the high fee, owning to an apprehension  that refusal by him to agree for the fee suggested by the arbitrator, may prejudice his case or create a bias in favour of the other party which readily agreed to pay the high fee”. Similarly, the High Court of Madras in Madras Fertilizers Limited v. SICGIL India Limited, 2007 SCC OnLine Mad 748 held that a party should not be forced to pay a higher fee which they are not capable of paying. In the said case the Court further held that if the arbitration is allowed capable to continue then the party, who is not capable of paying the higher fee would not be in a proper frame of mind to proceed with the arbitration and it will definitely have some doubt as to the conduct of the arbitrator. Accordingly, the High Court terminated the mandate of the arbitrator. It is also submitted that attempts by an arbitrator to renegotiate his contract after appointment can easily undermine the confidence of one or more of the parties in the arbitrator‟s ability to perform the task he has agreed and is being paid to perform. To buttress his contention, he has referred to the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Sea Containers Ltd. v. ICT PTY Ltd., 2002 NSWCA 84.",

Mr. Tripathi has stated that this is an absurd argument since if this was the intention of the Tribunal, no revision of fee would have been required. It is submitted that a bare perusal of the orders dated November 24, 2021, November 25, 2021, January 12, 2022, January 31, 2022 and March 01, 2022 would demonstrate that the Tribunal has unilaterally revised its fee, after agreeing a lump sum fee as per fourth schedule, at ₹ 1,50,000/-per sitting over and above the lump sum fee. The Tribunal revised its fee vide order dated November 24, 2012 ; thereafter vide order dated November 25, 2021 directed the parties to make good the shortfall of fees payable to the arbitrators (this was towards the lump sum amount); thereafter vide order dated January 12, 2022 the Tribunal again directed the parties to make good the shortfall of fee which was towards the lump sum amount; thereafter vide order dated January 31, 2022 the Tribunal directed the parties to deposit ₹3 lakh each to the Arbitrators, the said fee was calculated at revised fee for four hearings (sittings dated January 08, 2022, January 09, 2022, January 31, 2022 and for the sitting to be held on February 01, 2022); and thereafter vide order dated March 01, 2022 directed the respondent to pay ₹ 3.9 lakhs (towards lump sum fee) to each arbitrator to match the payment made by the claimant and thereafter, further, directed the respondent to pay ₹ 3 lakhs (fee @ ₹ 1,50,000/- per sitting over and above the lump sum fee) to each arbitrator in terms of the order dated January 31, 2022.",

The Tribunal directed the claimant to make good the short fall of ₹6 lakh to be paid to the presiding arbitrator. This direction was towards the lump sum fee. Since the petitioner had paid ₹ 15 lakh to each arbitrator and the claimant had paid ₹ 18.90 lakh towards each arbitrator, the respondent was directed to pay ₹ 3.9 lakh to each arbitrator to match the payment made by the claimant. The Tribunal further noted that in terms of order dated January 31, 2022 the claimant had deposited ₹ 3 lakh to each arbitrator (this being claimant‟s share of the revised fee @ ₹1.5 lakh per arbitrator per sitting). It directed the respondent to comply with the directions issued on January 31, 2022 and deposit ₹ 3 lakh to each arbitrator.

Since, the respondent has already paid ₹18.90 lakh to each arbitrator towards lump sum and ₹6.75 lakh is payable by it towards per hearing fee the total whereof comes to ₹ 25,65,000/-(paid ₹ 21.9 lakh so far) the threshold of ₹49,87,500/-.

Moreover, it is also the case of the petitioner as put forth by Mr. Tripathi that even under the Fourth Schedule of the Act, which is pari materia to the Fee Schedule of ICADR, the maximum fee payable is ₹ 30,00,000/-. He has pointed out that the issue qua the ceiling limit under the Fourth Schedule is pending before the Supreme Court in the case of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. Afcons Gunanusa JV, Arbitration Petition (Civil) 05/2022 and connected matters which included the case of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Simplex Infrastructure, SLP(C) No. 10358/2020, where the petitioner herein, i.e., the NHAI has filed an impleadment application and argued for the ceiling of ₹ 30,00,000/-. To buttress his argument that the ceiling is in fact ₹30,00,000/-, he has relied upon a judgment of the High Court of Patna in the case of State of Bihar and Ors. v. Bihar Sugarcane Corporation Ltd. and Ors., MANU/BH/0720/2020; a judgment of the High Court of Allahabad at Lucknow in State of UP and Ors., v. GVK EMRI (UP) Pvt. Ltd. and Ors., MANU/UP/1313/2021, and the 246th Law Commission Report dated August 2004. He has also referred to the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases of OS Singh and Anr. v.

Prahlad Bhairoba Suryavanshi (Dead) by LRs and Ors., (2002) 3 SCC 676, to contend that the provision in the sixth entry of the Fourth Schedule of the Act should be interpreted to  mean that the maximum ceiling of fee payable is ₹ 30,00,000/-and not ₹49,87,500/-. Further, as per the agreement and the ICADR Rules applicable to the arbitration, the arbitrator‟s fee is capped at ₹30,00,000/-and the petitioner has paid its share of ₹15,00,000/-.",

According to him, this failure is clear from the following facts:- i.  Pleadings were complete by the end of 2018. In the year 2019 end (and 4-5 days of January next), the petitioner finished cross examination of all three witness of the claimant.  ii.  The petitioner has only one witness, whose cross examination started on February 10, 2020, and has not been concluded even after 27 months, i.e., 34 hearings.  iii.  From January 2021, when the new presiding arbitrator was appointed, the sitting starts at 4.30 PM and goes on for a maximum of 45 to 90 minutes. Hearings are never fixed for Saturday or Sunday  iv.  During proceeding on February 22, 2021 only 18 questions were asked.  v.  During proceeding on March 19, 2021 only 10 questions were asked.  vi.  During proceeding dated April 04.2021 only 14 questions were asked.  vii.  During proceedings dated October 18, 2021 only 11 questions were asked.  viii.  During proceedings dated November 24, 2021 only 14 questions asked.  ix.  During proceedings dated November 25, 2021 only 9 questions asked.  x.  During proceeding dated December 09, 2021 only 15 questions asked.  xi.  During proceeding dated January 31, 2022 only 11 questions asked.  xii.  The witness came from Patna for most of the cross-examination because the respondent cast certain insinuations, even though cross-examination was also held in virtual mode.  xiii.  Furthermore, on the applications filed by the petitioner, the Tribunal spent an entire session hearing the parties. However, after the entire hearing, it proceeded to direct that they will decide the applications later.  In support of his plea that for these reasons as well, the mandate of the Tribunal is liable to be terminated, he has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the matter of Ariba India Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Ispat Industries Ltd., OMP No. 358/2010 wherein this Court terminated the mandate of the arbitrator who did not proceed with the arbitration expeditiously and efficiently.",

This was the averment raised by petitioner before the Tribunal, as well as the case set up in its pleadings.

This is clear and evident from a perusal of the order dated March 01, 2022 wherein the Tribunal has clearly recorded as under:  “by the order dated 20.09.2018 passed by the Tribunal, as then constituted, fees payable to each of the Arbitrators was fixed at Rs.49.87,500/-. This was to be paid in equal share by each of the parties. The parties seem to have accepted this without demur. Till the end of January, 2022 the Claimant had paid Rs. 12.90 lakhs to the Presiding Arbitrator and Rs. 18.90 lakhs to each of the two Arbitrators. Pursuant to the direction given on 31.01.2022, the Claimant has deposited Rs.3 lakhs with the three Arbitrators.  Till 9.12.2021, the Respondent had paid to each of the Arbitrators gross amount of only Rs.15 lakhs less TDS. Thereafter, the Respondent has not even paid Rs.3 lakhs to any member of the Tribunal as directed on 31.01.2022. It is pointed out by the two Ld. Co-Arbitrators that the Respondent has also not deposited the full amount of charges for administrative expenses and that Rs.50.000/-is due and payable by the Respondent to each of the two Co-Arbitrators. In the record of the proceedings dated 25.01.2021 it was noted that the parties had deposited, with the Ld. Co-Arbitrators various amounts adding up to Rs. 16.50,000/-. This was a mistake because the deposit of fees made till then was as noted above. On 25.01.2021, direction was also given to the parties to make good the shortfall of fees payable to the Ld. Co-Arbitrators. This has not been complied with so far. In view of the above, it has become imperative to pass a specific order with regard to payment of fees by the parties to the Arbitrators. The Claimant is directed to make good the shortfall of Rs 6 lakhs as compared to the Respondent and pay the same to the Presiding Arbitrator. Further, the Respondent has been remiss and negligent in paying its share of fees and administrative expenses to the three Arbitrators. They are now specifically directed to pay to each of the Arbitrators Rs.3.9 lakhs to match the payment made by the Claimant as noticed above. Further, they must comply with the direction made on 31.02.2022 about payment of Rs. 3 lakhs each of three Arbitrators.”",

Since, the respondent has already paid ₹18.90 lakh to each arbitrator towards lump sum and ₹6.75 lakh is payable by it towards per hearing fee, the total whereof comes to ₹ 25,65,000/-which is beyond the 50% fee payable by each party by taking the threshold as ₹49,87,500/-, i.e., ₹ 24,93,750/-.",

                        "content": "The submission of Mr. Tripathi is appealing, inasmuch as the Tribunal despite fixing the fee of ₹49,87,500/-on September 20, 2018 by taking into account both the claims and counter claims, could not have re-fixed the fee beyond the said figure. This I say so, as it is settled law that the arbitrator can charge the fee only as has been agreed by the parties. The Supreme Court in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (supra) and connected matters, which judgment also included the decision in Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. (supra), has held that the Arbitral Tribunal cannot deviate from the terms of reference, the same being a tripartite agreement between the parties and Tribunal, and any amendments, revisions, additions may only be made with the consent of the parties. The orders dated August 16, 2021 and  November 24, 2021 would show that the Tribunal, observing that the proceedings are becoming protracted, decided that the fee payable to the members of the Tribunal required reconsideration and had fixed, the per sitting fees as ₹1.5 lakh per arbitrator. The Tribunal did not clarify, that, the amount of ₹1.5 lakh shall only be paid till the cap of ₹49,87,500/-is reached. The Tribunal not having said that, the intent of the order of the Tribunal was to go beyond the figure of ₹49,87,500/-. But one document on which much reliance has been placed by Mr. Banerji is the order dated November 25, 2021 i.e., the date fixed by the Tribunal on November 24, 2021 when Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned counsel for the petitioner herein, raised an objection to the Tribunal ordering fee to be paid at ₹1.5 lakh per sitting to be shared equally by the parties. He stated, there are judgments which he is not citing but shall produce the next day, i.e., November 25, 2021. He in fact, submitted the judgments to the Tribunal and in the order of November 25, 2021, the Tribunal inter-alia has stated as under:  “We have gone through those judgment and it only needs to be clarified by us that the fee payable to the members of the Tribunal will be as per law in this regard.”",

                        "content": "The above order passed by the Tribunal was on a consideration of the judgment(s) that the fee to be charged by the Tribunal shall be “as per law”. The Tribunal has not clarified what it meant by the words “as per law”. It can be inferred that the intent of the order dated November 25, 2021 was to say that the Tribunal cannot exceed the figure as permissible in law. The law that existed was that, the Tribunal could not have charged the fee beyond ₹49,87,500/-. So, the  benefit of the expression “as per law” would accrue in favour of the Tribunal for the reason that the order dated November 24, 2021 had not attained finality as the counsel for the respondent had objected to the Tribunal fixing the fee @ ₹1.5 lakh per hearing and wanted to show certain judgment(s) and on consideration of the judgment(s), on November 25, 2021, the Tribunal clarified that the fee payable will be as per law. As such, this Court is not inclined to agree with the submission of Mr. Tripathi that the Tribunal has fixed the fee beyond ₹49,87,500/-and as such, the mandate of the Tribunal need to be terminated. In view of my above conclusion, the judgments relied upon by Mr. Tripathi in the cases of Singh Builders Syndicate (supra); Madras Fertilizers Ltd. (supra); NTPC (supra); Delhi State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (supra); Jivanlal Jotiram Patel (supra); Sea Containers Ltd. (supra) and K/S Norjarl (supra) are clearly distinguishable on facts. Mr. Tripathi has also relied upon the Judgment in the case of Gayatri Jhansi Roadways Ltd. (supra), wherein the Supreme Court after considering two judgments of Coordinate Benches of this Court in Gayatri Jhansi Roadways (supra) and Gammon Engineers and Contractors Pvt. Ltd. (supra) held as under:  “However, the learned Single Judge’s conclusion that the change in language of Section 31 (8) read with Section 31-A which deals only with the costs generally and not with arbitrator’s fees is correct in law. It is true that the arbitrator’s fees may be a component of costs to be paid but it is a far cry thereafter to state that Sections 31(8) and 31-A would directly govern contracts in which a fee structure has already been laid down. To this extent, the learned Single Judge is correct. We  may also state that the declaration of law by the learned Single Judge in Gayatri Jhansi Roadways Ltd. [NHAI v. Gayatri Jhansi Roadways Ltd. 2017 (SCC) OnLine Del 10285] is not a correct view of the law.”  The above judgment is also distinguishable in view of the issue which falls for consideration and in view of my above conclusion.",

I also find no order of the Tribunal to pay the fee for nine sittings, as has been sought to be contended by him. It may also be stated that direction of the Tribunal for payment of fees in the manner depicted in the orders dated January 31, 2022 and March 01, 2022 would also not have had the effect of taking the fee per Arbitrator beyond ₹49,87,500/-.",

Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the Petitioner filed the present Petition. Relevant part of the impugned judgment is reproduced hereunder:  “Sh. Kanwar Lal, ATI, of the petitioner has testified that as per report EX.AWl/1 the deceased respondent was found absent from duty with effect from 9.3.1992. The charge sheet EX.AW2/A was issued. There is no evidence to contradict the statement of AW Sh. Kanwar Lal. There is no evidence from the side of the Respondents that leave application or medical certificate of the deceased respondent were sent for the period of his absence from duty. Consequently, the continuous absence from duty with effect from 9.3.1992 without any intimation and permission amounts to misconduct within the meaning of para 4 (i) (ii) of the standing order governing the conduct of DTC employees. It also amounts to misconduct within para 19 (f) (h) & (m) of the standing order as the deceased respondent was negligent towards his duty. Hence, the case regarding the misconduct of the deceased respondent stands established.  AW Smt. Neelam Malhotra, Senior Clerk working in DTC Depot, Vasant Vihar has testified that full one month's amounting to Rs. 2,579/-was remitted to the Respondent through money order. The salary was sent as per salary certificate EX.AW2/1. Thee is no denial by the Respondents of receiving of the one month's salary alongwith the letter of removal of the deceased respondent from service.  Thus, the petitioner has been able to establish all the ingredients of Section 33 (2) (b) of I.D. Act. The petition is allowed. File be consigned to record room.”",

Further, while conducting the enquiry, the procedure established under the D.T.R.A (Conditions for Appointment and Service) Regulation 1952 has not been followed. The enquiry report does not even whisper about the illness of the petitioner‟s husband. It is also not out of place to mention that the petitioner‟s husband was  entitled to medical leave, casual leave, extraordinary leave and special leave and no such leave was ever granted to him.  Secondly, respondent No.2 has not served the charge sheet as well as the notice of enquiry on the petitioner‟s husband.  Thirdly, principles of Natural Justice have not been followed as the petitioner has not been given any opportunity to defend his case. Neither oral enquiry nor detailed investigation were conducted. It is also pertinent to note that no service was ever effected on the petitioner‟s husband and thus the decision of the Enquiry officer ex-parte is malafide.  Fourthly, the learned Industrial Tribunal even after recording in its order dated 04.08.1999 that the enquiry conducted by respondent No.2 was perverse and cannot be acted upon, went ahead ex-parte on the respondent No.2‟s request without issuing fresh notice to the petitioner‟s husband to frame additional issues of misconduct. The learned Tribunal in utter disregard to the principles of Natural Justice ex-parte justified the malafide act of removing the petitioner‟s husband from service vide the Impugned Judgment.",

                        "content": "In view of the above stated legal principle, this Court examined the impugned order dated 16.10.2009. From the perusal of the same, it is evident that the learned Tribunal, in the present case, exceeded its jurisdiction while passing the impugned order dated 16.10.2009. The learned Tribunal ought not to have examined the veracity of the domestic enquiry conducted by the Respondent Management. The learned Tribunal failed to examine the issue as to „whether the proposed action was the result of victimization against the Workman‟. Generally, in such cases, this Court remands the matter back to the Tribunal for fresh examination. However, in the present case, this Court finds that such course would not be appropriate. The Workman has already expired and his widow is the Petitioner before this Court. The Tribunal granted approval vide order dated 16.10.1999. More than two  decades have elapsed from the passing of the approval order. Hence, in the interest of justice, this Court examined the application filed by the Respondent Management under Section 33(2)(b) of the ID Act and the reply filed by the Petitioner herein as well as other relevant documents. From the perusal of the documents, it is apparent that the proposed action was not the result of any victimization against the Workman. The Respondents acted in the usual course of their business and conducted a domestic enquiry. After conclusion of the said enquiry, punishment has been imposed on the deceased workman. Since there is no victimization against the Workman, the Application filed by the Respondent Management under Section 33(2)(b) of the ID Act was rightly allowed by the learned Tribunal. However, the learned Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction while examining the legality of the domestic enquiry conducted by the Respondent Management. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the proceeding under Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act is not a substitute for an industrial dispute referred for adjudication under Section 10 of the I.D. Act. It is for this reason only that the decision on the application under Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act does not close the right of the workman to raise an industrial dispute under Section 10 of the I.D. Act.",

                        "content": "Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussion, the impugned order of the learned Tribunal is upheld to the extent that the approval is accorded to the Respondent Management under Section 33(2)(b) of the I.D. Act for proceeding against the  Workman (now deceased). The learned Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction while examining the legality of the domestic enquiry and hence the findings of the learned Tribunal with respect to the legality of the domestic enquiry conducted by the Respondent Management are hereby set aside. The Petitioner is at liberty to challenge the said domestic enquiry conducted by the Respondent Management in accordance with law. It is further clarified that in case the Petitioner initiates any fresh proceedings challenging the domestic enquiry conducted by the Respondents, the same is to be considered afresh without being influenced by any observations made by the learned Tribunal in the impugned order dated 16.10.1999.",
