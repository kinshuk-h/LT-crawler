(5) On issuance of prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act prohibiting employment of contract labour or otherwise, in an industrial dispute brought before it by any contract labour in regard to conditions of service, the industrial adjudicator will have to consider the question whether the contractor has been interposed either on the ground of having undertaken to produce any given result for the establishment or for supply of contract labour for work of the establishment under a genuine contract or is a mere ruse/camouflage to evade compliance of various beneficial legislations so as to deprive the workers of the benefit thereunder. If the contract is found to be not genuine but a mere camouflage, the so-called contract labour will have to be treated as employees of the principal employer who shall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour in the concerned establishment subject to the conditions as may be specified by it for that purpose in the light of para 6 hereunder.  (6)  If the contract is found to be genuine and prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act in respect of the concerned establishment has been issued by the appropriate Government, prohibiting employment of contract  labour in any process, operation or other work of any establishment and where in such process, operation or other work of the establishment the principal employer intends to employ regular workmen he shall give preference to the erstwhile contract labour, if otherwise found suitable and, if necessary, by relaxing the condition as to maximum age appropriately taking into consideration the age of the workers at the time of their initial employment by the contractor and also relaxing the condition as to academic qualifications other than technical qualifications.”  “126. We have used the expression industrial adjudicator by design as determination of the questions aforementioned requires inquiry into disputed questions of facts which cannot conveniently be made by High Courts in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Therefore, in such cases the appropriate authority to go into those issues will be industrial tribunal/court whose determination will be amenable to judicial review.”  (emphasis supplied)",

Union of India reported as 2010 (4) LLJ 451 for demonstrating the import of the consultation as envisaged in Section 10 of the Act. Relying on this interpretation, learned counsel has contended that the consultation in the case at hand was not effective consultation. It will be apt at this juncture to quote the relevant para from the judgment:  “20. \"Consultation\" is a word of many hues. Its meaning/interpretation is contextual. In my view, the word \"consultation\" in Section 10 has to take colour from and/or be read in the context of the obligation/duty of the Board in Section 3 to advise the Government. In the present case no advice has been given by the Board. All that the Board has done is to constitute a Committee and to forward the report of the said Committee to the Government. The views, suggestions, observations, recommendations of the members of the Committee cannot be considered as the advice of the Board to the Central Government. More so, when the same were not unanimous. As aforesaid, the members of the Committee were not the members of the Board. They were outsiders appointed to investigate facts and place the report with their views before the Board. The obligation/duty under the Act to advise the Central Government is not of the members of the said Committee but of the Board. The Board as aforesaid has been prescribed to comprise of a Chairman to be appointed by the Central Government, the Chief Labour Commissioner and such other members from the Government, Railways, Coal Industry, Mining Industry, contractors, workmen or any other interest, which, in the opinion of the Government, ought to be represented on the Board. It is assumed that the Government, in appointing the Chairman of the Board will have due regard to the duties to be performed by him. The person appointed as a Chairman is expected to be an expert or having experience and qualification in the subject. The role of such a highly specialized body, containing representatives from several fields, as the Board is under Section 3 of the Act, cannot be reduced only to appointment of a committee and of forwarding the report of the committee to the Central Government. The qualifications prescribed of the  members of the Board are not to be utilized in the appointment of the committee and/or in selecting the members of the committees but in rendering advice to the Government on whether the employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work in any establishment should be prohibited or not. I am afraid the Board in the present case has not rendered any advice whatsoever as it was required to and in the absence of any advice rendered, there could not be any consultation of the Central Government with the Board, only whereafter the Central Government is to take a decision on whether to prohibit contract labour or not.”",

Once this veil is pierced, lack of consultation between CACLB and the Central Government and non-application of mind on behalf of the authorities in question become manifest. This can be gleaned  from the incoherence between the committee report and the impugned Notification. It is pertinent to note that as per the terms of reference, the committee constituted under Section 5 of the Act was to study the nature of “watch and guard” activities whereas the report submitted by the committee mentioned “watch and ward.” It is to be noted that the impugned  Notification has prohibited employment of contract labour for the activity of “watch and guard.”",

It would be apt to quote the relevant paragraph from the judgment at this juncture:  “Keeping in view the aforesaid nature of the security services and surveillance, namely, complete security cover being provided by these contractors who engage ex-servicemen, to such sensitive installations, it cannot be said that the work being done by these security guards is „watching the buildings‟ Notification dated 9.12.1976 which was issued more than 20 years ago could not have contemplated such kind of specialised Security Services while abolishing the contract in the field of „watching the buildings‟. I agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents that the expression „watching the buildings‟ was at that time used for those who were watchman or chowkidar. It was never contemplated that it would cover the cases of ex-servicemen employed under the aforesaid scheme by the specialised security agencies for providing surveillance and security cover to sensitive  installations. The very purpose of providing such kind of security would otherwise be defeated. It is clear from the various documents produced on record that the notification dated 9.12.1976 was in the knowledge of the Government while framing such scheme for rehabilitation and in fact reference is made to the said notification specifically. Thus the Central Government which had issued notification dated 9.12.1976 prohibiting contract labour for „watching the buildings‟ was conscious of that fact and it is apparent that the same Central Government while framing the scheme had interpreted that the specialised security services would not be covered by the expression “watching the buildings”. One can also draw support from the provisions of Section 2(i) of the Security Guards Regulation Act, 1981 as per which security work and watch and ward are treated separately. Once we have the material of the kind available on record which clearly distinguishes watch and ward from security guards, one cannot come to different conclusion based on the traditional meaning of the word „watch‟ as defined in various dictionaries. In such cases, one has to take pragmatic approach and Court cannot turn its blind eye to the realities of life. The very purpose of providing such specialised and sensitive nature of security cover and surveillance would be defeated if such contract labour is treated as abolished by applying notification dated 9.12.1976.”",

However this argument missed the essential point, namely, it is not only the providing of security services by these ex-servicemen but entire security cover which is the specialised job of the security agency who manages the show and plans the job requirement and as to how the security cover is to be provided and on that basis deploys the security personnel employed by it. If these contract workers are made direct and recruit employees of the principal employers, for example, Airports Authority of India or Indian Oil Corporation in these cases, they are ill-equipped to achieve the objective of providing security cover to the buildings/sensitive installations. It is not the work which is required to be performed by the security guards individually but planning and management and the manner in which this work is to be taken from security guards, which is of paramount importance.

The specialised kind of securities which the establishment like Airports Authority of India or Indian Oil Corporation need today hardly requires any emphasis. A watchman or a chowkidar, understood in traditional sense, is ill-fit to provide such sensitive and highly specialised security and surveillance. Therefore such public sector undertakings were directed to appoint security agencies sponsored by DGR as their contractors inasmuch as such security agencies who are sponsored by DGR are supposed to employ Ex-servicemen. Thus, it served twin purpose namely i) rehabilitation of ex-servicemen by providing them with jobs and ii) providing such public sector undertakings specialised and highly skilled security cover which they require. These security agencies like in the instant cases are providing security cover to the principal employer and not only manpower for watch and ward duties.”",

A.  38/2015  held as follows:  “20. Further, the findings recorded by the learned Arbitrator to allow the application of the respondent under section 16 of the Act are misplaced. The learned Arbitrator holds that where there is an allegation of collusion, it would require interrogation of the suspects. Similarly, he holds that there are accusing fingers being pointed out at some unidentified members of the staff. He further holds that to identify these members would require interrogation and the learned Arbitrator does not have such power to summon and interrogate anyone. This finding is entirely misplaced and misconceived. The interrogation is to be done by the police at the time of investigation of the FIR. The learned Arbitrator is not investigating the facts stated in the FIR. The simple case before the learned Arbitrator was as to whether the respondent is liable to refund excess payment and also pay the other dues of the appellant. The question of the learned Arbitrator interrogating any suspect would not and does not arise.",

The question for consideration is whether it should be treated as a class of its own or otherwise. This issue has already been dealt with by this Court in the case of P. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2020) 13 SCC 791, after taking note of the earlier decisions governing the field. The gravity of the offence, the object of the Special Act, and the attending circumstances  are a few of the factors to be taken note of, along with the period of sentence. After all, an economic offence cannot be classified as such, as it may involve various activities and may differ from one case to another. Therefore, it is not advisable on the part of the court to categorise all the offences into one group and deny bail on that basis. Suffice it to state that law, as laid down in the following judgments, will govern the field:—  Precedents  •  P. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement, (2020) 13 SCC 791: 23. Thus, from cumulative perusal of the judgments cited on either side including the one rendered by the Constitution Bench of this Court, it could be deduced that the basic jurisprudence relating to bail remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused has the opportunity of securing fair trial. However, while considering the same the gravity of the offence is an aspect which is required to be kept in view by the Court. The gravity for the said purpose will have to be gathered from the facts and circumstances arising in each case. Keeping in view the consequences that would befall on the society in cases of financial irregularities, it has been held that even economic offences would fall under the category of “grave offence” and in such circumstance while considering the application for bail in such matters, the Court will have to deal with the same, being sensitive to the nature of allegation made against the accused. One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of the offence is also the term of sentence that is prescribed for the offence the accused is alleged to have committed. Such consideration with regard to the gravity of offence is a factor which  is in addition to the triple test or the tripod test that would be normally applied. In that regard what is also to be kept in perspective is that even if the allegation is one of grave economic offence, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in every case since there is no such bar created in the relevant enactment passed by the legislature nor does the bail jurisprudence provide so. Therefore, the underlining conclusion is that respective of the nature and gravity of charge, the precedent of another case alone will not be the basis for either grant or refusal of bail though it may have a bearing on principle. But ultimately the consideration will have to be on case-to case basis on the facts involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand trial.  (emphasis supplied)  •  Sanjay Chandra v. CBI, (2012) 1 SCC 40:  “39. Coming back to the facts of the present case, both the courts have refused the request for grant of bail on two grounds : the primary ground is that the offence alleged against the accused persons is very serious involving deeprooted planning in which, huge financial loss is caused to the State exchequer; the secondary ground is that of the possibility of the accused persons tampering with the witnesses. In the present case, the charge is that of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property and forgery for the purpose of cheating using as genuine a forged document. The punishment for the offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years. It is, no doubt, true that the nature of the charge may be relevant, but at the same time, the punishment to which the party may be liable, if convicted, also bears upon the issue. Therefore, in determining whether to grant bail, both the seriousness of the  charge and the severity of the punishment should be taken into consideration.",

The primary purposes of bail in a criminal case are to relieve the accused of imprisonment, to relieve the State of the burden of keeping him, pending the trial, and at the same time, to keep the accused constructively in the custody of the court, whether before or after conviction, to assure that he will submit to the jurisdiction of the court and be in attendance thereon whenever his presence is required.  xxx  xxx    xxx",

We cannot mix up consideration of a bail application, which is not punitive in nature with that of a possible adjudication by way of trial. On the contrary, an ultimate acquittal with continued custody would be a case of grave injustice.”  to contend to the effect that economic offences cannot be classified as a category of one group to deny bail on that basis to further submit to the effect that in view of the factum that the Investigating Agency has completed the investigation and the charge sheet has been filed, the continued incarceration of the applicants in custody is no longer required and they be released on bail pending trial on stringent conditions in order to ally the apprehension expressed by the CBI.

The Respondent quoted Claimant undertaking and denied the payment. It is submitted that the Claimant executed the works in compliance of job mix formula issued by the Engineer. It is pertinent to mention that as per the Agreement the Respondent shall pay the additional cost to be incurred on the excess quantity of bitumen. It is reiterated that the Claimant executed the work in compliance of the aforementioned job mix formula. However, after completion of the work, the Respondent insisted upon the Claimant to issue an undertaking letter that it will not claim differential amount on the bitumen cost and the Respondent offer to pay the bill amount, withheld amount and LD amount but unfortunately after issuing the letter, the Respondent denied the aforementioned payment and also denying the difference cost of the bitumen.

The Arbitral Tribunal found that said report of the IIT Chennai was approved by the Engineer of the Appellant. The Engineer had also independently approached another organisation, namely, Siddharth Academy which had also confirmed that the bitumen content in the mix used by the Respondent for executing the works was higher than 5%. The Engineer of the Appellant had also assessed the additional amount payable on account of increased in the bitumen content at Rs.1,74,00,974/-and had recommended that the said amount be released to the Respondent.",

At this juncture, it is pertinent to extract reasons given by the Tribunal on this issue which read as under:  “L. The Claimant completed the BC work in Feb. 2012 and the Engineer recommended for payment for the work aftergetting satisfied of the work and the quantity of bitumen used in the work, in May 2012. The Respondent paid 50% in July 2012. The entire work was completed on 30.06.2012 and the Engineer issued completion certificate on 08.10.2012 and the certificate of completion of DLP was also issued on 23.03.2013.  M.  The Respondent's letter dated 29.05.2015 (Page 260 of RD-03) reveals that the Respondent made several requests to the Claimant to withdraw the Claim. The Claimant finally with their letter dated 27.04.2013 informed that they will not claim over and above 5% of bitumen variation for the bituminous work carried by them. This makes AT, to believe the argument of the Claimant that in view of huge amounts pending with the Respondent, this letter was provided.  N.  There is no dispute between the parties on the quantity of bitumen used in the BC work. The amount was arrived by the Engineer based on the actual quantity bitumen used which was got verified by an independent agency and recommended payment. The amount recommended for payment for the excess bitumen used in BC item of work was Rs.1,74,00,973/-. The Employer released payment of 50% recommended amount i.e. Rs.58, 75,000/-for want of confirmation of tests with third party (Exhibit R-86, Page 222). The Respondent even after getting confirmation of tests by third party did not release the balance 50% withheld. Even the 50% of the amount paid was  recovered subsequently.  O.  In view of the above findings, AT is of the view to allow the Claim of Rs.174,00,973/-towards extra quantity of bitumen consumed in the accepted BC work.”",

Sriharan (2016) 7 SCC 1, while examining an issue “whether a special category of sentence instead of death for a term exceeding 14 years can be made by putting that category beyond grant of remission” held that it is only the Division Bench of the High Court which derives power under the Penal Code to prescribe an alternate punishment with one either for the entirety of the convicts’ life or for a specific period of more than 14 years depending upon the gravity of the crime. Therefore, the learned Trial Court’s direction awarding the sentence of life imprisonment of not less than 20 years, would therefore be erroneous and beyond its jurisdictional power under the Penal Code. For ease of reference, the relevant prargraphs of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court while deliberating upon the issue as to whether imprisonment for life means for rest of one’s life with any right to claim revision and whether a special category of sentence, instead of death, for a term exceeding 14 years, putting that  category beyond application of revision can be imposed are extracted as under:  “103. In fact, while saying so we must also point out that such exercise of power in imposition of death penalty or life imprisonment by the Sessions Judge will get the scrutiny by the Division Bench of the High Court mandatorily when the penalty is death and invariably even in respect of life imprisonment gets scrutinized by Division Bench by virtue of the appeal remedy provided in the Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore, our conclusion as stated above can be reinforced by stating that the punishment part of such specified offences are always examined at least once after the Sessions Courts’ verdict by the High Court and that too by a Division Bench consisting of two Hon’ble Judges.",

We live in a civilised society where law and order is supreme and the citizens enjoy inviolable fundamental human rights. But when the incident of gang rape like the present one surfaces, it causes  ripples in the conscience of society and serious doubts are raised as to whether we really live in a civilised society and whether both men and women feel the same sense of liberty and freedom which they should have felt in the ordinary course of a civilised society, driven by Rule of Law. Certainly, whenever such grave violations of human dignity come to fore, an unknown sense of insecurity and helplessness grabs the entire society, women in particular, and the only succour people look for, is the State to take command of the situation and remedy it effectively.”",

Blending the statutory definition of active duty in the potion of the two Office Memorandums, in harmony with the rule of interpretation of beneficial legislation, it can be said that the death of a force personnel due to heart attack suffered just after performing actual duty would be a case of an accidental death in the course of performance of duties.

It is also not disputed that out of his last three postings, two were in high altitude areas and the last was a hard posting. There is no denial from the respondents that in the family of the petitioner, there is no history of death by heart attack. Moreover, at the time of filing of the present petition, father of the petitioner, aged 83 years, was said to be living a healthy life. The cause of death of petitioner’s husband has been opined as “acute myocardial infarction”. In medical terms, the reasons for most myocardial infarctions are coronary artery disease due to prolonged deprivation of oxygen supply and when one or more areas of heart muscles do not get enough oxygen, it results into heart attack. It is not wrong to presume here that due to various postings in high altitude areas, Ram Kumar Singh might have been deprived of oxygen necessary for a healthy heart and sustained medical problems, which could not be known at initial stage. It is admitted by respondent that on 20.01.2018, deceased Ram Kumar Singh had gone to visit the road sector O-K-S-R-T road and Shergaon-Morshing-Phudung Road and returned to his location at 476RMPL in Shergaon at 1910 hours and on return he complained of chest pain and at about 1945 hours, he was rushed to the Military Hospital Tenga Velley, which is indisputably located at a distance of 65 kilometres and so, the necessary medical  assistance which supposedly was required to be provided to him instantly, however, could only be given after approximately three hours thereof.",

Prior to 25.08.2016, WhatsApp (the Appellant in LPA 163/2021), a messaging platform, was governed by its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of July 2012. In the year 2014, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook (the Appellant in LPA 164/2021). Facebook Inc. is now known as “Meta Platforms”, however, for ease of comprehension, this Court shall refer to the Appellant in LPA 164/2021 by its former nomenclature.  ii.  On 25.08.2016, the Terms and Services and the Privacy Policy of WhatsApp (hereinafter referred to as “2016 Policy”) was updated, and WhatsApp users were informed of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp and how Facebook would use WhatsApp’s information for its advertisement and products. A one-time opportunity was given to WhatsApp users to opt out of Facebook using their information that was shared over WhatsApp. However, users who joined WhatsApp after the 2016 Policy, were not offered this option.  iii.  The 2016 Policy, was challenged by way of a writ petition in Karmanya Singh Sareen & Anr. v. Union of India &Ors., W.P.(C) 7663/2016, and the policy was upheld vide Judgement dated 23.09.2016. This Judgment has been challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and adjudication on the same is pending.  iv.  On 04.01.2021, WhatsApp announced an update to its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as “2021 Policy”). The 2021 Policy was also challenged before this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court, and the said matters are still pending.  v.  It is stated that cognizance was taken by the Respondent No.1, Competition Commission of India (hereinafter referred to as the “CCI”), of the 2021 Policy, and accordingly vide Order dated 24.03.2021, the CCI initiated a suo motu case under Section 26(1) of the Act by directing the Director-General, CCI (DG) to conduct an investigation in order to examine the potential abuse of dominance exercised by both the Appellants under Section 4 of the Act.  vi.  This Order dated 24.03.2021 under Section 26(1) of the Act was challenged before this Court in W.P.(C) 4378/2021 and W.P.(C) 4407/2021 by the Appellants herein. Vide Judgment dated 22.04.2021, the learned Single Judge held that the CCI-Respondent No.1 in both the Appeals would not be divested of its jurisdiction that it possesses under the Act merely because an issue may be pending before the Supreme Court or the High Court. Furthermore, it was observed that the Order passed under Section 26(1) of the Act is purely administrative in nature and does not entail any consequence on the civil rights of the Appellants herein. Accordingly, the learned Single Judge dismissed the petitions filed by the Appellants herein.  vii.  Aggrieved by the Judgment dated 22.04.2021, passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.(C) 4378/2021 and W.P.(C)  4407/2021, the Appellants have approached this Court by filing the instant Appeals.",

Union of India & Ors., W.P.(C) 7663/2016, and this Court vide Judgment dated 23.09.2016 had upheld the 2016 Policy by holding that the users of WhatsApp, having voluntarily opted to avail services of the said application, were bound by the terms of service offered by WhatsApp, and it is always open to users of WhatsApp who do not want their information to be shared with Facebook to opt for deletion of their accounts. Mr. Salve further relies upon Vinod Kumar Gupta v. Whatsapp Inc., (Case No. 99/2016), wherein the CCI, i.e. Respondent No.1 upheld the 2016 Policy with the finding that there had been no abuse of dominance by the Appellant. He also states that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeiTY) is in the process of promulgating a Personal Data Protection Bill and the policies of the Appellant would be answerable to the provisions stipulated in the same, and therefore, the CCI should refrain from adjudicating on this issue before the Bill is promulgated.",

He submits that the order of CCI is not merely administrative, as has been held by the learned Single Judge, as the powers of the DG are quite drastic. He relies upon the Order dated 24.03.2021 to state that Respondent No.1 itself in Paragraph 4 of the said Order has referred to a previous case on the same issue, i.e. Vinod Kumar Gupta v. Whatsapp Inc., (Case No. 99/2016) wherein the CCI has held that 2016 Policy does not institute anti-competition practices. He further submits that the 2021 Policy also falls within the purview of the information technology law framework and that a reading of the letter dated 18.05.2021 issued by the MeiTY also demonstrates that the issues are overlapping.",

He submits that the learned Single Judge has come to the conclusion that there is an overlap of jurisdiction in paragraph 33 of the impugned Judgment and, after arriving at the said conclusion, the learned Single Judge has observed that it would be prudent for the Commission to keep its hands off till the issues pending  before the Supreme Court are decided. He states that a perusal of the additional affidavit demonstrates that the questions that have been posed by MeiTY in its letter dated 18.05.2021 with regard to the 2021 Policy to the Appellant are the same as the questions that have been referred by Respondent No.1 to the Appellant.

He further brings to the notice of this Court Section 57 of the Act and Regulation 35 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations, 2009, and states that these provisions do not ensure that the confidentiality of the matter is maintained as the same is only dependent on the discretion of the CCI at the end of the day. Further, there is no guarantee regarding the maintenance of confidentiality as is evident by the fact that other entities such as the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) and one Prachi Kohli have filed intervention applications on being made aware of the issue.

He states that the Appellant has a right to carry on his business in accordance with law and relies upon Barium Chemicals v. Company Law Board & Ors., 1966 Supp. SCR 311.

He also places on record a judgement of NCLAT dated 02.08.2022 wherein the NCLAT upheld the Order of the CCI in Vinod Kumar Gupta (supra), thereby cementing the findings of the CCI.

He states that the CCI is examining the 2021 Policy through the prism of the Competition Act, 2002, in a bid to discharge its statutory functions as a competition law regulator and is, therefore, not concerned with the possible violation of fundamental rights that is being delved into by the Supreme Court. Mr. Venkataraman, therefore, argues that the scope of jurisdiction of the CCI lies on a different plane than that of a Constitutional Court, and the fact that the latter is seized of the matter has no bearing on the investigation that is being conducted by the DG, CCI. Furthermore, attention has been drawn to Sections 60 and 62 of the Act to state that the Act shall have an overriding effect, and that the application of other laws would not be barred.",

I have considered these rival submissions of the parties and I am of the opinion that the jurisdiction and the power of the various investigating authorities derived from the jurisdiction vested in them by the  various legislations or statutes, the authority which is doing the inquiry and or conducting the investigation is required to carry out investigation keeping in mind the legal provisions and legal limitations which are stipulated under the respective statute. Undoubtedly it can be that there may be an overlapping investigation but in my opinion such an eventuality cannot prevent any investigating authority from carrying out investigation in respect of their jurisdiction conferred on them under the statute. I am also of the further opinion that the investigation in respect of the corporate fraud can be initiated and considered by the central government under section 237(b)(i) of the companies Act. I have not been able to come across any provisions under the SEBI act in which any corporate fraud can be investigated by the SEBI. Undoubtedly it can be investigated under normal criminal law by the CBI. I am further of the opinion that merely because the material on the basis of which investigation is being undertaken is identical to the material which is subject matter of investigation by the other authority it can not be stated that both the authorities can not simultaneously investigate pursuant to power conferred on them under their respective statutes. I am of the opinion that every authority is entitled to investigate even may be in respect of the same material as well as from the angle and facet in which they have been asked to carry out investigation. It is possible that the SEBI may be investigating the same material on the ground of breach of the various provisions of the SEBI act and other security related legislations whereas the central government, department of company affairs can consider and/or investigate the fraud and/or breach of various provisions of law in the light and context of the provisions of the companies act may be in respect of the same material. However, I am of the opinion that the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant cannot be accepted particularly in view of the fact that every authority has been conferred various powers in their respective legislation. A similar issue  aroused before the English Court under the identical provisions of investigation under the Companies Law and the Court of Appeal in the case of Re London United Investments plc reported in 1992 BCLC 285 equivalent to 1971 All England Law Reports page 849 it is held as under:  “The power of the secretary of state to appoint inspectors to investigate the affaris of a company and to report is an important regulatory mechanism for ensuring probity in the management of companies' affairs. That of course is in the public interest. Since the Secretary of State's powers under s 432(2) are exercisable where there are circumstances suggesting fraud, it is likely that in many cases where inspectors are appointed an investigation by the police or the Serious Fraud Office could also be appropriate. But the code under the 1985 Act is a separate code even though it may overlap the field of criminal investigation.””",

These are jurisdictional aspects. Unless TRAI finds fault with the IDOs on the aforesaid aspects, the matter cannot be taken further even if we proceed on the assumption that CCI has the jurisdiction to deal with the complaints/information filed before it. It needs to be reiterated that RJIL has approached the DoT in relation to its alleged grievance of augmentation of POIs which in turn had informed RJIL vide letter dated 6-9-2016 that the matter related to interconnectivity between service providers is within the purview of TRAI. RJIL thereafter approached TRAI; TRAI intervened and issued show-cause notice dated 27-9-2016; and post issuance of show-cause notice and directions, TRAI issued recommendations dated 21-10-2016 on the issue of interconnection and provisioning of POIs to RJIL. The sectoral authorities are, therefore, seized of the matter. TRAI, being a specialised sectoral regulator and also armed with sufficient power to ensure fair, non-discriminatory and competitive market in the telecom sector, is better suited to decide the aforesaid issues. After all, RJIL's grievance is that interconnectivity is not provided by the IDOs in terms of the licences granted to them. The TRAI Act and Regulations framed thereunder make detailed provisions dealing with intense obligations of the service providers for providing POIs. These provisions also deal as to when, how and in what manner POIs are to be provisioned. They also stipulate the charges to be realised for POIs that are to be provided to another service provider.

Only when the jurisdictional facts in the present matter as mentioned in this judgment particularly in paras 72 and 102 above are determined by TRAI against the IDOs, the next question would arise as to whether it was a result of any concerted agreement between the IDOs and COAI supported the IDOs in that endeavour.

We have discussed the scope and ambit of the TRAI Act in the given context as well as the functions of TRAI. No doubt, we have accepted that insofar as the telecom sector is concerned, the issues which arise and are to be examined in the context of the TRAI Act and related regime need to be examined by TRAI. At the same time, it is also imperative that specific purpose behind the Competition Act is kept in mind. This has been taken note of and discussed in the earlier part of the judgment. As pointed out above, the Competition Act frowns at the anti-competitive agreements. It deals with three kinds of practices which are treated as anti-competitive and are prohibited. To recapitulate, these are:  (a)  where agreements are entered into by certain persons with a view to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition;  (b)  where any enterprise or group of enterprises, which enjoys dominant position, abuses the said dominant position; and  (c)  regulating the combination of enterprises by means of mergers or amalgamations to ensure that such mergers or amalgamations do not become anti-competitive or abuse the dominant position which they can attain.",

The purpose is to eliminate such practices which are having adverse effect on the competition, to promote and sustain competition and to protect the interest of the consumers and ensure freedom of trade, carried on by other participants, in India. To this extent, the function that is assigned to CCI is distinct from the function of TRAI under the TRAI Act. The learned counsel for the appellants are right in their submission that CCI is supposed to find out as to whether the IDOs were acting in concert and colluding, thereby forming a cartel, with the intention to block or hinder entry of RJIL in the market in violation of Section 3(3)(b) of the Competition Act. Also, whether there was an anti-competitive agreement between the IDOs, using the platform of COAI. CCI, therefore, is to determine whether the conduct of the parties was unilateral or it was a collective action based on an agreement. Agreement between the parties, if it was there, is pivotal to the issue. Such an exercise has to be necessarily undertaken by CCI. In Haridas Exports [Haridas Exports v. All India Float Glass Manufacturers' Assn., (2002) 6 SCC 600] , this Court held that where statutes operate in different fields and have different purposes, it cannot be said that there is an implied repeal of one by the other. The Competition Act is also a special statute which deals with anti-competition. It is also to be borne in mind that if the activity undertaken by some persons is anticompetitive and offends Section 3 of the Competition Act, the consequences thereof are provided in the Competition Act.  *****",

Even if TRAI also  returns a finding that a particular activity was anticompetitive, its powers would be limited to the action that can be taken under the TRAI Act alone. It is only CCI which is empowered to deal with the same anticompetitive act from the lens of the Competition Act. If such activities offend the provisions of the Competition Act as well, the consequences under that Act would also follow. Therefore, contention of the IDOs that the jurisdiction of CCI stands totally ousted cannot be accepted. Insofar as the nuanced exercise from the standpoint of the Competition Act is concerned, CCI is the experienced body in conducting competition analysis. Further, CCI is more likely to opt for structural remedies which would lead the sector to evolve a point where sufficient new entry is induced thereby promoting genuine competition. This specific and important role assigned to CCI cannot be completely wished away and the “comity” between the sectoral regulator (i.e. TRAI) and the market regulator (i.e. CCI) is to be maintained.",

At the same time, since the matter pertains to the telecom sector which is specifically regulated by the TRAI Act, balance is maintained by permitting TRAI in the first instance to deal with and decide the jurisdictional aspects which can be more competently handled by it. Once that exercise is done and there are findings returned by TRAI which lead to the prima facie conclusion that the IDOs have indulged in anticompetitive practices, CCI can be activated to investigate the matter going by the criteria laid down in the relevant provisions of the Competition Act and take it to its logical conclusion. This balanced approach in construing the two Acts would take care of Section 60 of the Competition Act as well.",

We also do not agree with the respondents that insofar as the telecom sector is concerned, jurisdiction of CCI under the Competition Act is totally ousted. In a nutshell, that leads to the conclusion that the view taken by the High Court is perfectly justified. Even the argument of the learned ASG is that the exercise of jurisdiction by CCI to investigate an alleged cartel does not impinge upon TRAI's jurisdiction to regulate the industry in any way. It was submitted that the promotion of competition and prevention of competitive behaviour may not be high on the change of sectoral regulator which makes it prone to “regulatory capture” and, therefore, CCI is competent to exercise its jurisdiction from the standpoint of the Competition Act. However, having taken note of the skilful exercise which TRAI is supposed to carry out, such a comment vis-à-vis TRAI may not be appropriate. No doubt, as commented by the Planning Commission in its report of February 2007, a sectoral regulator, may not have an overall view of the economy as a whole, which CCI is able to fathom. Therefore, our analysis does not bar the jurisdiction of CCI altogether but only pushes it to a later stage, after TRAI has undertaken necessary exercise in the first place, which it is more suitable to carry out.” (emphasis supplied)",

(RJIL) had specifically approached TRAI for the settlement of this dispute. TRAI, being the authority that would mandate the adherence to licensing conditions, was, therefore, deemed fit to be seized of the matter before the charge of investigation could be given to the CCI.",

This contention of the Appellants is not acceptable. It is the case of the Appellants that while the Apex Court is looking into whether the 2021 Policy is violative of the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution of India or not, the investigation by CCI is confined to whether the 2021 Policy is in furtherance of the dominant position occupied by WhatsApp and institutes anti-competitive practices. The sphere of operation of both are vastly different. Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court are analysing the 2021 Policy through the prism of competition law. The Order dated 24.03.2021 rendered by the CCI also notes the same:  “13. In relation to the above mentioned contentions of WhatsApp, the Commission is of the view that the judgments relied by WhatsApp have no relevance to the issues arising in the present proceedings and its plea is misplaced and erroneous. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bharti Airtel Case has no application to the facts of the present case as the thrust of the said decision was to maintain 'comity' between the sectoral regulator (i.e. TRAI, in the said case) and the market regulator (i.e. the CCI). WhatsApp has  failed to point out any proceedings on the subject matter which a sectoral regulator is seized of. Needless to add, the Commission is examining the policy update from the perspective of competition lens in ascertaining as to whether such policy updates have any competition concerns which are in violation of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act. Further, the Commission is of the considered view that in a data driven ecosystem, the competition law needs to examine whether the excessive data collection and the extent to which such collected data is subsequently put to use or otherwise shared, have anti-competitive implications, which require anti-trust scrutiny. The reliance of WhatsApp on Vinod Kumar Gupta and other cases is also misplaced as the Commission has only observed that breach of the Information Technology Act does not fall within its purview. However, in digital markets, unreasonable data collection and sharing thereof, may grant competitive advantage to the dominant players and may result in exploitative as well as exclusionary effects, which is a subject matter of examination under competition law. It is trite to mention that the provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law, as declared under Section 62 of the Act.”",

In contradistinction, the direction under Section 26(1) after formation of a prima facie opinion is a direction simpliciter to cause an investigation into the matter. Issuance of such a direction, at the face of it, is an administrative direction to one of its own wings departmentally and is without entering upon any adjudicatory process.

Formation of a prima facie opinion departmentally (the Director General, being appointed by the Central Government to assist the Commission, is one of the wings of the Commission itself) does not amount to an adjudicatory function but is merely of administrative nature.

Furthermore, it is pertinent to note that the 2021 Policy is a substantially modified version of the 2016 Policy inasmuch as the 2016 Policy had an “opt-out” option, which is absent from the 2021 Policy that places its users in a “take-it-or-leave-it” situation. It is the “opt-out” option that primarily led to CCI rendering its conclusion that the 2016 Policy did not violate the Competition Act, 2002. However, in the face of changed circumstances, considering the dominant position occupied by WhatsApp, the investigation proposed to be conducted by CCI does not warrant interference, and res judicata would, thus, not be applicable in the instant case. In view of this, the fact that the Order of the CCI in Vinod Kumar Gupta (supra) has been upheld by the NCLAT vide Order dated 02.08.2022 is of no relevance and does not sway the opinion of this Court. Similarly, the emphasis placed by the Appellants on the letter dated 18.05.2021 is wholly irrelevant as the mere mentioning of the Competition Act does not denote that MeiTY is seized of the violations that may be incited by the 2021 Policy. The sphere of jurisdiction occupied by MeiTY is different from that of the CCI, and solely because the said letter alludes to possible violations of the Act does not oust the jurisdiction of the CCI. Per contra, the letter only strengthens the contention of Respondent No.1 that there does exist a prima facie violation of the provisions of Competition Act, 2002.

Such data shows that WhatsApp messenger is the most widely used app for social messaging, followed by Facebook Messenger in the relevant market delineated by the Commission supra. Further, it is way ahead of other messaging apps like Snapchat, WeChat etc. showing its relative strength. Given that WhatsApp messenger and Facebook Messenger are owned by the same group, they do not seem to be constrained by each other, rather adding on to their combined strength as a group. Moreover, WhatsApp Messenger works on direct network effects where an increase in usage of a particular platform leads to a direct increase in the value for other users—and the value of a platform to a new user will depend on the number of existing users on that platform. Thus, given its popularity and wide usage, for one-to-one as well as group communications and its distinct and unique features, WhatsApp seems to be dominant.",

A communication network/platform gets more valuable as more users join it, thereby benefiting from network effects. The OTT messaging platforms not being interoperable, communication between two users is enabled only when both are registered on the same network. Thus, the value of a messaging apps platform increases for users with an increasing number of their friends and acquaintances joining the network. In India, the network effects have indubitably set in for WhatsApp, which undergird its position of strength and limit its substitutability with other functionally similar apps/platforms. This, in turn, causes a strong lock-in effect for users, switching to another platform for whom gets difficult and meaningless until all or most of their social contacts also switch to the same other platform. Users wishing to switch would have to convince their contacts to switch and these contacts would have to persuade their other contacts to switch. Thus, while it may be technically feasible to switch, the pronounced network effects of\" WhatsApp significantly circumscribe the usefulness of the same. The network effects have been reflected when despite increase in downloads of the competing apps like Signal and Telegram, user base of WhatsApp apparently did not suffer any significant loss. As pointed out in Harshita Chawla case (supra), the second largest player in terms of market share in the relevant market of instant messaging and thus the next sizeable alternative available to users is Facebook Messenger, which too is a Facebook Group company.

It is also pertinent to note that at numerous places in the policy while illustrating the data to be collected, the list is indicative and not exhaustive due to usage of words like 'includes', 'such as', 'For example', etc., which suggests that the scope of sharing may extend beyond the information categories that have been expressly mentioned in the policy. Such opacity, vagueness, open-endedness and incomplete disclosures hide the actual data cost that a user incurs for availing WhatsApp services.

By and large, to ensure retention of its user base and to prevent any other disruptive technology from entering the market, data is utilised by tech companies to customise and personalise their own platforms so that its userbase remains hooked.

In view of these observations, it is evident that CCI has, after due consideration, arrived at its decision that a prima facie case of violation of provisions of the Competition Act, 2002, has been made out against the Appellants herein that would require an investigation to be initiated by the DG. The learned Single Judge has taken into consideration all these factors before observing that  concentration of data in the hands of WhatsApp may raise competition concerns, thereby resulting in the violation of Section 4 of the Act.",

                        "content": "Additionally, the reliance of the Appellants on CCI’s Order in Vinod Kumar Gupta (supra) is misplaced for the simple reason that 2016 Policy provided its users the option to “opt-out” of sharing user account information with Facebook within 30 days of agreeing to the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The 2021 Policy, however, places its users in a “take-it-or-leave-it” situation, virtually forcing its users into agreement by providing a mirage of choice, and then sharing their sensitive data with Facebook Companies envisaged in the policy. Therefore, it cannot be said that the CCI is bound by its own findings in Vinod Kumar Gupta (supra) when the issue at hand as well as the circumstances are different.",

In this regard, the Court finds merit in the submission of the learned ASGs that one of the key issues with the 2021 Policy is its propensity to share the data of its users with Facebook Inc., the parent company of WhatsApp. Solely for the reason that the policies itself do not emanate out of Facebook Inc., the Appellant cannot hide behind the fact that it is the direct and immediate beneficiary of the data sharing mechanism envisaged by the policies. These circumstances necessitate the presence of the Appellant in LPA 164/2021 as a proper party in the investigation pertaining to the 2021 Policy and the alleged anti-competitive practices they trigger.",

The decision taken by the DG lies in the fact that a thorough investigation can only be conducted if the Applicant cooperates in the same.",

The contention of Mr. Tripathi that the Applicant has chosen to implead itself in the appeal filed by Facebook cannot be accepted by this Court. The Applicant will have to first make out a prima facie case before the learned Single Judge that there is no allegation against it in the Order of the CCI. The case of the Applicant would involve independent application of mind by the learned Single Judge. The instant appeals are primarily on the issue as to whether the CCI ought to wait till final adjudication of the issues which are pending before the Apex Court. The Impleadment Application cannot be entertained in the instant appeals which have been filed by Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp. This Court, therefore, does not deem it fit to scuttle the investigation at a nascent stage and defers to the wisdom of the DG and the CCI, and rejects the Impleadment Application. However, the Applicant is granted the liberty to take all such steps as required by it, in accordance with law, to impugn the CCI Order.",
