Another submission of his is that the Petitioner company being the highest bidder is awarded the contract and has duly complied with the terms contained therein, and the said award of tender contract vests a right in the Petitioner to operate food and beverage stalls as per terms of the RFP. The act of the competent authorities of Respondent No. 1 pursuant to the direction of Vigilance Directorate in cancelling the tender on the basis of the ongoing investigation is violative of the principles of natural justice, inasmuch a fair opportunity of hearing was denied, especially in light of the  fact that the impugned letter of cancellation of award does not delve into the reasons justifying the apprehension extant in the opinion of the Vigilance Directorate. In support of his argument with respect to principals of natural justice, the learned Senior Counsel refers to the position of law with respect to applicability of principles of natural justice in public tenders, which is reiterated in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of U.P. v. Sudhir Kumar Singh, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 847, which reads as under:  “70.7. Writ can be issued where there is executive action unsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation there is denial of equality before law or equal protection of law or if it can be shown that action of the public authorities was without giving any hearing and violation of principles of natural justice after holding that action could not have been taken without observing principles of natural justice.”  “33(6) While applying the rule of audi alteram partem (the primary principle of natural justice) the Court/Tribunal/Authority must always bear in mind the ultimate and overriding objective underlying the said rule, viz., to ensure a fair hearing and to ensure that there is no failure of justice. It is this objective which should guide them in applying the rule to varying situations that arise before them.”  (emphasis supplied)",

The relevant paragraph is as follows:  “13. In other words, a mere disagreement with the  decision-making process or the decision of the administrative authority is no reason for a constitutional court to interfere. The threshold of malafides, intention to favour someone or arbitrariness, irrationality or perversity must be met before the constitutional court interferes with the decision-making process or the decision.”  *****  “15. We may add that the owner or the employer of a project, having authored the tender documents, is the best person to understand courts must defer to this understanding and appreciation of the tender documents, unless there is mala fide or perversity in the understanding or appreciation or in the application of the terms of the tender conditions. It is possible that the owner or employer of a project may give an interpretation to the tender documents that is not acceptable to the constitutional courts but that by itself is not a reason for interfering with the interpretation given.” (emphasis supplied)",

Union of India and Anr., (2020) 16 SCC 489, which has held as under:  “25…We must remember that we are dealing with purely administrative decisions. These are in the realm of contract. While rejecting the tender the person or authority inviting the tenders is not required to give reasons even if it be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. These decisions are neither judicial nor quasi-judicial. If reasons are to be given at every stage, then the commercial activities of the State would come to a grinding halt. The State  must be given sufficient leeway in this regard.”  (emphasis supplied)",

Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Ors., W.P. (C) No. 8914/2006 and CM Nos. 6529 and 7392-94/06. The relevant portion of the said judgment has been reproduced as under:  “21.In the case at hand, the respondent has not taken recourse to the clause empowering it to reject all or any of the tenders without assigning any reason to place a mala fide, arbitrary, whimsical or otherwise untenable decision beyond the purview of any challenge. Here, the discretion has been properly exercised keeping in view the interests of the Authority. This is evident from the records placed before the court including the report of the Vigilance Committee. Simply because all the reasons and the background facts that led to the taking of this decision were not disclosed by the respondent to the petitioner in its reply to the petitioner's notice whereby the petitioner was informed of the authority's decision to reject all tenders would not, in our view, invalidate the same, especially when the same exist on record. It is well within the power of the respondents, who fall within the purview of 'state' to try and ensure, in a bona fide manner, that it secures the best possible rates and for that purpose to create conditions that are conducive to attracting the maximum number of bids. Furthermore, in view of the fact that it was open to the petitioner to participate in the fresh tender enquiry floated thereafter by the respondent Corporation for the same work, it cannot also be said that the petitioner has in any way been discriminated against or shut out from tendering for the work in question. On the facts before  us, we, therefore, see no ground to conclude that the decision is not bona fide, or that the petitioners have been put to any major disadvantage, merely because this tender has been cancelled.” (emphasis supplied)",

The Court does not have the expertise to examine the terms and conditions of present-day economic activities of the State and this limitation should be kept in view. Courts should be even more reluctant in interfering with contracts involving technical issues as there is a requirement of the necessary expertise to adjudicate upon such issues. The approach of the Court should be not to find fault with magnifying glass in its hands, rather the Court should examine as to whether the decision-making process is after complying with the procedure contemplated by the tender conditions. If the Court finds that there is total arbitrariness or that the tender has been granted in a malafide manner, still the Court should refrain from interfering in the grant of tender but instead relegate the parties to seek damages for the wrongful exclusion rather than to injunct the execution of the contract. The injunction or interference in the tender leads to additional costs on the State and is also against public interest.  Therefore, the State and its citizens suffer twice, firstly by paying escalation costs and secondly, by being deprived of the infrastructure for which the present-day Governments are expected to work.”  (emphasis supplied)",

Ltd., Civil Appeal No. 843-844/2021, to state that there is no pleaded case adverting to the applicable Section, and how it extends the limitation from the date of which the cause of action originally arose. According to Mr. Kumar, the petitioner has not pleaded about any event which would extend the period of limitation. Plus, there are no averments which manifest that the period of limitation got extended, when in the normal course, the Limitation got expired on October 31, 2016 for the claims of damages/prolongation/ escalation and on October 31, 2019 for the claim of work done during the defect liability period.",

As per Mr. Kumar, this line of argument was taken by Mr. Trivedi, only to contend that the limitation got extended. Mr. Kumar countered this line of argument by stating that the said argument was without pleading and it was not a pleaded case adverting to the applicable Section and it was also not shown that how it extended the limitation from the date, the cause of action originally arose. Hence, the said argument is liable to be rejected at the threshold. Mr. Kumar qualifies his argument by stating that the extension of time was granted to the petitioner, only at his request in view of the unconditional  undertaking submitted by the petitioner and with the grant of extension of time, the delay in completion of the work was regularized by the respondent in order to favour the petitioner, since without the same, it would have been difficult for the petitioner to bid for future projects.",

The courts at the referral stage do not perform ministerial functions. They exercise and perform judicial functions when they decide objections in terms of Sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration Act. Section 8 prescribes the courts to refer the parties to arbitration, if the action brought is the subject of an arbitration agreement, unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists.

State of Gujarat, (2013) 4 SCC 301 : (2013) 2 SCC (L&S) 270] , this Court had noted: (SCC p. 320, para 48)  “48. „27. … A prima facie case does not mean a case proved to the hilt but a case which can be said to be established if the evidence which is led in support of the case were [to be] believed. While determining whether a prima facie case had been made out or not the relevant consideration is whether on the evidence led it was possible to arrive at the conclusion in question and not whether that was the only conclusion which could be arrived at on that evidence.‟ [Ed.: As observed in Martin Burn Ltd. v.

Only when the court is certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists or the disputes/subject-matter are not arbitrable, the application under Section 8 would be rejected.  At this stage, the court should not get lost in thickets and decide debatable questions of facts. Referral proceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini trial.

In such cases a full review by the courts at this stage would encroach on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and violate the legislative scheme allocating jurisdiction between the courts and the Arbitral Tribunal.

This being so, the two provisions should be read as laying down similar standard and not as laying down different and separate parameters. Section 11 does not prescribe any standard of judicial review by the court for determining whether an arbitration agreement is in existence. Section 8 states that the judicial review at the stage of reference is prima facie and not final. Prima facie standard equally applies when the power of judicial review is exercised by the court under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, we can read the mandate of valid arbitration agreement in Section 8 into mandate of Section 11, that is, “existence of an arbitration agreement”.  ** ** ** **",

However, the allottee, in blatant violation of the terms and conditions of the allotment letter sold the plot. The allottee sold the property in question within 6 months of the original allotment, which showed the conduct of the allottee that he intended to attain monetary benefit from the residential plot and not use it as a residential plot.",

This Court does not find any merit in this ground taken by the petitioner since equality of treatment cannot be sought where the petitioner himself is in the wrong and has been holding the property in question without authorisation.
