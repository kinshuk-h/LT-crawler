The mark of the defendant is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs. The test to be applied for judging the claim of infringement and passing off is of an unwary consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection. The same, following the judgments of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968 and Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, has been reiterated by the judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court dated 26.07.2022 in Mondelez India Foods Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. Neeraj Food Products, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2199, where it has been held as under:  •29. In two seminal judgements of the Supreme Court, the test of infringement and deceptive similarity of competing marks is well settled. The Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968, has observed that the said question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. It was observed that, to such a man, the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them. The relevant extracts from the judgment in Corn Products (supra) are set out below:  •18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is well known that the question whether the two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the court to decide that question. English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word is an English word which to the mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole. So considered, we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from the syllable •co• in the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the other.",

The  Aquamatic case (Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty's Ld.) is a recent case where the test of the commonness of the idea between two marks was applied in deciding the question of similarity between them. Again, in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks we have to approach it from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection.

The relevant extracts of the said judgment, which has been followed in innumerable judgments subsequently, are set out hereinbelow:  •According to Kerly•s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (9th Edition Paragraph 838) •Two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person acquainted with the one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted.  It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail  might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own. It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him.•  (Emphasis Supplied)",

                        "content": "With regard to the above submissions and facts before me, I find it appropriate to refer to the observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan [(2004) 7 SCC 528]:  “…12. In regard to cases where earlier bail applications have been rejected there is a further onus on the court to consider the subsequent application for grant of bail by noticing the grounds on which earlier bail applications have been rejected and after such consideration if the court is of the opinion that bail has to be granted then the said court will have to give specific reasons why in spite of such earlier rejection the subsequent application for bail should be granted.” 10.1 In the case of Neeru Yadav vs. State of UP & Anr., (2016) 15 SCC 422, it is held by this Court in para 11 as under:  “11. It is a well settled principle of law that while dealing with an application for grant of bail, it is the duty of the Court to take into consideration certain factors and they basically are: (i) the nature of accusation and the severity of punishment in cases of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence, (ii) reasonable apprehension of  tampering with the witnesses for apprehension of threat to the complainant, and (iii) prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the charge. (Chaman Lal v. State of U.P., (2004) 7 SCC 525)” 10.2 In Anil Kumar vs. State (NCT of Delhi), (2018) 12 SCC 129, it is observed and held by this Court that while granting bail, the relevant considerations are, (i) nature of seriousness of the offence; (ii) character of the evidence and circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; and (iii) likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice; (iv) the impact that his release may make on the prosecution witnesses, its impact on the society; and (v) likelihood of his tampering…”",

                        "content": "In the case of Prahlad Singh Bhati vs. NCT of Delhi & Ors.,  (2001)  4 SCC 280, the Apex Court opined that the jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on the basis of well settled principles having regard to the circumstances of each case and not in an arbitrary manner. It is observed and held as under:  “…The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on the basis of well settled principles having regard to the circumstances of each case and not in an arbitrary manner. While granting the bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail, the character, behaviour, means and standing of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interests of the public or State and similar other considerations. It has also to be kept in mind that for the purposes of granting the bail the Legislature has used the words „reasonable grounds for believing‟ instead of “the evidence” which means the court dealing with the grant of bail can only satisfy it as to whether there is a genuine case against the accused and  that the prosecution will be able to produce prima facie evidence in support of the charge…”   The present case is one where the complainant bank has allegedly been cheated by the applicant for a sum of Rs. 19 Crores. Economic offences, apart from causing loss to the institution directly involved, also disturb the economy. Hon’ble Supreme Court observed in the case of Nimmagadda Prasad vs. Central Bureau of Investigation (Criminal Appeal Number 728 of 2013) as under:  26)  Unfortunately, in the last few years, the country has been seeing an alarming rise in white-collar crimes, which has affected the fiber of the country’s economic structure. Incontrovertibly, economic offences have serious repercussions on the development of the country as a whole. In State of Gujarat vs. Mohanlal Jitamalji Porwal and Anr. (1987) 2 SCC 364 this Court, while considering a request of the prosecution for adducing additional evidence, inter alia, observed as under:- “5.....The entire Community is aggrieved if the economic offenders who ruin the economy of the State are not brought to book. A murder may be committed in the heat of moment upon passions being aroused. An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the Community. A disregard for the interest of the Community can be manifested only at the cost of forfeiting the trust and faith of the Community in the system to administer justice in an even handed manner without fear of criticism from the quarters which view white collar crimes with a permissive eye unmindful of the damage done to the national economy and national interest….”  27)  While granting bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail, the character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interests of the public/State and other similar considerations. It has also to be kept in mind that for the purpose of granting bail, the Legislature has used the words \"reasonable grounds for believing\" instead of \"the evidence\" which means the Court dealing with the grant of bail can only satisfy it as to whether there is a genuine case against the accused and that the prosecution will be able to produce prima facie evidence in support of the charge. It is not expected, at this stage, to have the evidence establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  28)  Economic offences constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail. The economic offence having deep rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds needs to be viewed seriously and considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country...”",

The same cannot be treated lightly or be called as a civil wrong. Cheating institutions of their money is a criminal offence which must be treated as such and dealt with accordingly. The loss caused to the exchequer due to misuse of public money creates an adverse impact on the economy and more often than not, the brunt is borne by the common man. It is thus imperative that disputes involving economic  offences are dealt with stringently to recover public money at the earliest and also set such precedence, which will dissuade others from committing similar offences. At this stage from the statement of the CA, it is clear that he did not issue the certificate dated 11.09.2008 regarding the Net Worth of the applicant as filed by her.",

Thereupon, Gaurav along with Yogesh and Sunil started to misbehave and beat Sanjay and Aman. On hearing their cries, Sunil (real brother of Sanjay), Vikas and Umesh (cousin brothers of Sanjay) came downstairs from their neighbouring houses. Accused Kamlesh (paternal aunt of accused Gaurav and Yogesh) also reached the spot and started abusing the complainants. Accused Kamlesh caught hold of Umesh from behind whereas accused Gaurav exhorted “sabo saba siha do” (teach a lesson) to all of them. All the accused persons took out knives from their possession and started inflicting injuries on Umesh indiscriminately and also attacked Vikas and Sunil with the knives when they tried to rescue their brother Umesh.

                        "content": "The contentions raised by the accused in their appeals are cumulatively inter alia as follows:  (i)  Conviction of the accused has been based on assumptions, presumptions, conjunctions and surmises and that there are material contradictions between the charge sheet and the evidence of the prosecution.  (ii)  The area where the altercation took place was a congested and populated area and assuming many people were gathered, no one was made a witness for the prosecution.  (iii)  The police officials did not recover anything at the instance of PW10 Aman. As per PW9 Sunil, there was no evidence to  substantiate whether the recovered knife belonged to the accused or not.  (iv)  That the accused Kamlesh was also injured on her chest during altercation but was not medically examined.  (v)  There were contradictions between the medical and the ocular evidence since as per the evidence led by the prosecution, the words “taabad todd chaau maare” were used by the accused during this scuffle which could have meant numerous knife injuries but there were only two injuries on the victims.  (vi)  The place of occurrence was near the house of the accused establishing that it was the family of the complainant who were the aggressors.  (vii)  No knife has been recovered from accused Sunil and Yogesh despite the accusation that they were all possessing knives on their person.  (viii)  There was no evidence that accused persons took undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner thereby attracting Exception (4) under Section 300 IPC as being premeditated, in the heat of passion, upon a sudden quarrel.  (ix)  At best in these circumstances, the influence drawn could be that fatal injury was inflicted by accused persons with the knowledge that they were likely to cause an injury which could lead to death but without any intention to cause death or to  cause such bodily injury and, therefore, would be punishable under Section 304 (Part II) of IPC.  (x)  The learned trial court having observed that if this would fall under Exception (4) under Section 300 IPC, Section 34 could not have been invoked as there would be no common element in the participation of the crime.  (xi)  The alleged exhortation attributed to accused Gaurav of “teaching a lesson” cannot be treated as an intention to cause death but could also be confined to causing simple hurt.  (xii)  The PCR call as received (Ex.PW21/A) mentioned that a lady had been hurt proving that the complainant had also used a knife and has no mention of the presence of PW3 Sanjay and PW10 Aman leading to the conclusion that they have been planted as alleged eye witnesses.  (xiii)  The recovery of the alleged knife cannot be treated as recovery under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 since as per disclosure statement of the appellant he had not mentioned that he had hid it under a stone whereas the recovery was such.  (xiv)  The prosecution had not been able to prove covert/overt act of the appellants, meeting of their minds or pre-arrangement to prove common intention. At most, it could be inferred that it was a free fight where both sides received injuries during the scuffle and one of such injuries prove fatal. There was no eye witness to state that who gave the fatal blow to the deceased.  (xv)  The knife that was recovered at the behest of accused Gaurav was not blood stained and no forensic analysis had been conducted on the same.  (xvi)  As per the Supreme Court in Shahjahan Ali & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra (2017) 4 SCC (Cri) 675 conviction under Section 302 was converted to that under Section 304 (II) IPC and limited to the sentence already undergone.

                        "content": "The learned senior counsel for accused No.2 (Gaurav) additionally submitted as under:  (i)  Only one injury was the fatal injury and it was not known who had caused it.  (ii)  Only one knife was recovered at the instance of accused No. 2 Gaurav from a public place and it reportedly had darkish material on it but no forensic examination was conducted. Two witnesses saw knife in the hands of other accused Yogesh and not Gaurav, therefore, it could not be proven that the knife recovered from Gaurav was used in the murder.  (iii)  Even if the accused were carrying knives but it was not for this particular purpose of killing the deceased. The injury inflicted should be the injury intended.  (iv)  The main act of delivering any fatal blow has not been attributed to the others and, therefore, a case under Section 34 cannot be sustained.  (v)  There were no proven previous criminal antecedents of the accused which go against the accused and extent of their conviction.  (vi)  There was no evidence of any previous enmity between the appellants and the victims.  (vii)  The injury caused to Kamlesh during the fight was not rebutted. In fact, PW-3 does not talk of Kamlesh at all in his testimony and there is a later improvement in the testimony of PW-10.  (viii)  The fatal injury was caused through the 7th and 8th rib damaging the liver. The nature and specificity of the injury could not have been intended in a street fight. Therefore, relying on Hon‟ble Supreme Court‟s decision in Virsa Singh, the intention was clearly not to inflict that particular injury.  (ix)  Appellant Sunil was arrested after two months and the rest of the appellants were arrested immediately. Sunil presented a plea of alibi which has not been examined.  (x)  PW-18 was the recovery constable who recovered the knife from Yogesh and later stated that it was Gaurav and that she could not identify the knife.  In light of inter alia the above contentions, the appellant‟s plea as advanced by their Counsels was that conviction under Section 304 (Part I) was extremely harsh in the circumstances and they were already in custody for eight years.",

                        "content": "In the appeal by the father of deceased under the proviso to Section 372 Cr.P.C., the following contentions have been raised by the appellant:- (i)  The facts and circumstances of the case warrant a conviction under Section 302 IPC for the murder of victim Umesh and the learned Trial Court was in error in mitigating it to Section 304 (Part I) IPC.  (ii)  Despite having returned findings under Section 300 (Thirdly) IPC, the learned Trial Court was in error in slotting it under Exception (4) of Section 300 IPC.  (iii)  To bring a case under Exception (4) of Section 300 IPC, all ingredients as articulated in Pappu v. State of M.P. (2006) 7  SCC 391 ought to be made out, which have not been in the facts of this case.  (iv)  There was no provocation from the complainants of the deceased. In fact the aggression was purely by the accused. The situation in question cannot be covered under Exception (4) to Section 300 IPC since it was not provoked by the victim-complainants. The knives were already therewith the appellants and they were pre-weaponized.  (v)  The contrary hypothesis suggested by the accused that the scuffle started on account of eve teasing by Aman, followed by accosting by Gaurav and Aman having beaten Gaurav with a bat is completely fabricated since no such injuries were received by Gaurav and no medical examination was ever conducted.  (vi)  The suggestions of previous enmity were given by the defence in the cross-examination of PW3 Sanjay and PW5 Vikas, therefore, suggesting that there was premeditation on this account.  (vii)  The deposition by PW2 Dr. Mukta Rani on the nature of injuries was that they were sufficient to cause death and, therefore, Section 300 (Thirdly) applies. The pulse of the deceased was found to be very weak as per PW-1 the doctor who recorded the MLC and examined the deceased and he further stated that the omentum was protruding and therefore  the fatal injury was severe and grave.  As per PW-28 and PW-8, the injuries to Sunil were also grievous injuries.  (viii)  They were four injured eye witnesses, namely, PW3, PW5, PW9 and PW10 viz. Sanjay, Vikas, Sunil and Aman respectively thereby providing the best evidence in favour of the incident as it occurred.  (ix)  The three knives had caused four stab injuries, two on the deceased Umesh and one each on Vikas and Sunil even though Sunil‟s injury was not fully an incision but had been mentioned in the MLC as grievous injury.  (x)  The examination of the weapon would reveal that it was not a normal kitchen knife but of 26 cm length with 15 cm of blade and 11 cm of handle as also the injuries corresponded to cut marks on the clothing.  (xi)  The fight was not a free for all and was triggered by a petty issue of snatching of Rs.100/-which shows that there was intent to kill in any event.  (xii)  Reliance was placed on Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab, 1958 SCR 1495 Paras 8, 9 & 12, 13 particularly for bringing a case under Section 300 (Thirdly). The said decision stated that intention to cause death would not matter in those circumstances as long as there is intention to inflict bodily injury which is objectively proved and that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.",

The appellants have relied upon judgments which are of single injury.  (ii)  The injury to PW-9 as testified by the PW-8 doctor was a grievous injury and not a simple injury and, therefore, there was no question in giving the benefit of doubt to the appellants on their intent to inflict fatal blows. Even PW-5 had a fractured collarbone as a result of him being secured by one of the accused.  (iii)  There was no sudden fight which had ensued between the appellants and the victims but was provoked by the appellants who were clearly the aggressors and were also respectively armed with knives. The injury which caused the fatality was opined by the doctor as one sufficient to cause death since it was deep incision which had pierced between the ribs and seriously punctured and cause severe damage to the organs inside.  (iv)  The prosecution relied upon inter alia the following authorities in support of their arguments:  a)  Pargan Singh v. State of Punjab, (2014) 14 SCC 619  b)  Abdul Sayeed v.

PW-2 testified that the cause of death was haemorrhage and shock consequent upon stab wound of abdominal organ via injury No.3 i.e. the stab injury which was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature and could be produced by some sharp cutting and stabbing single edged weapon. PW-2 further opined that the other abrasion injuries could be produced by blunt force, weapon and object.  Subsequently, after being shown the weapon of offence, PW-2 gave a subsequent opinion confirming that the two incised wounds could have been produced by the weapon examined by her. The weapon itself was about 26.5 cm knife with about 15.5 cm of blade and 11 cm of a wooden handle and about 3 cm wide and tapering down to a sharp point.

Upon PW-3 asking Gaurav as to why he had snatched the money, all three started abusing him, upon which PW-3‟s cousin Umesh (the deceased) and Vikas (PW-5) came downstairs hearing the noise of the quarrel, as well as Sunil (PW-9, PW-3‟s brother). Scuffle ensued and all three accused took out knives and attacked them whereupon Vikas, Umesh and Sunil received injuries and the accused then ran away from the spot before somebody called the PCR. PW-3 denied the suggestion in his cross-examination that a fight took place between him and some other people and that he and his brother were found misbehaving with some girls or that his son Aman had beaten up Gaurav and, therefore, a scuffle had taken place. PW-5 Vikas narrated the same incident from the point when he came to the spot having heard the noise of the quarrel and also stated that accused Kamlesh had come and caught hold of Umesh from behind while Gaurav exhorted “sabko saba sikha do” and thereupon all three accused took out knives from their possession and started inflicting injuries on Umesh indiscriminately (“tabar tod chauon se hamla iya”).When he and his brother tried to intervene and saved Umesh they were also attacked and received injuries. PW-10 Aman  testified on similar lines and confirmed that Kamlesh had abused them and secured Umesh from behind while Gaurav exhorted “aaj ina aam tamam ar dete hain” and the knife attack happened immediately thereafter. While PW-3 stated that the whole episode had finished in 15 minutes, PW-5 in his testimony suggested that “the incident took place within seconds”. The appellants had tried to point to this inconsistency as well as the one in the description of exhortation by Gaurav in support of their case. However, considering it was a scuffle followed by a knife attack with number of people involved and the witnesses were all victims and injured, these minor deviations in a situational description may not be relevant for establishing reasonable doubt in favour of accused.",

                        "content": "On a meticulous examination of the evidence on record, the submissions by the parties, this Court finds inter alia that:  (a)  The whole incident of the appellants attacking the complainants with knives was witnessed by four eye witnesses viz. Sanjay, Aman, Sunil and Vikas, all four being injured and out of which Sunil and Vikas were seriously injured. This resulted in the death of Umesh the cousin brother of Sanjay. The testimonies of complainant Sanjay as PW-3, Vikas as PW-5, Sunil as PW-9  and Aman as PW-10, the four injured eye witnesses, are consistent with each other, minor contradictions notwithstanding. There is nothing which would discredit these testimonies as to the incident.  (b)  The fact that the appellants Gaurav, Sunil and Yogesh were already in the street and had accosted Aman, snatching Rs.100/from him, which led to Aman‟s father Sanjay approaching them is also evident from the testimonies of the eye witnesses, which have not been discredited in their cross-examinations.  (c)  The fact that these three appellants Gaurav, Yogesh and Sunil were already standing there and later joined in by Kamlesh, while the complainant Sanjay came and was then followed by Vikas and Sunil makes it evident that it was the appellants which had orchestrated and triggered the fight and not the complainants and his family members.  (d)  The testimonies of the eye witnesses also corroborate that it was the appellants (except for Kamlesh) who were already armed with weapons and had knives on their person, which they took out in order to inflict injuries on the complainant, Vikas and Sunil and the deceased Umesh. Kamlesh even though not possessing a weapon played the critical role in securing the deceased from the back and exhorting the others to attack, by stating that the complainant and his family members should be taught a lesson.  (e)  The fight which ensued was not a “free-for-all” but was clearly triggered at the behest of the appellants by snatching Rs.100/- from PW-10 Aman demonstrating thereby an intent to invite a fight and an opportunity to cause injury to the complainant and his family who were residing in close proximity.  (f)  The fatal injury inflicted on deceased Umesh was severe as evident from the deposition of the doctor who conducted the post mortem and was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature. Besides the fatal injury to deceased Umesh, there were five other injuries which were reported by the doctor. Knife injuries were also sustained by Sunil (on the left of the upper chest) and on Vikas, which was, as per medical opinion, a grievous injury.  (g)  The exhortation of Gaurav was specifically reported by PW-5, PW-10 and PW-9 and despite minor differences in the exact phraseology of the exhortation, it was evident that there was a call by Gaurav to hurt and cause severe injury, even fatal (ina aam tama ar dete hain and saba sihate hain).  (h)  The plea of alibi taken by appellant Sunil was not proven by the defence and no corroboration was offered of a mere statement by DW-4 nor were the prosecution witnesses put a suggestion in their cross-examination that they did not see Sunil since he was not there.  (i)  The alternative theory put forward by the defence that it was certain frivolous act by PW-10 Aman that had resulted in the fight was not substantiated in any manner whatsoever to form a credible testimony.  The issue, which is now to be examined, is whether in these facts and circumstances, was the learned Trial Court correct in handing down a conviction of Section 304 (Part I)/308/34 IPC or, as contended by the father of the deceased, that it ought to be under Section 302/307/34 IPC. This enquiry necessitates a review of the principles set-out by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of India in certain notable judgments.",

                        "content": "The locus classicus on the nuances of Section 300 (Thirdly) IPC is the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab (1958) SCR 1495; AIR 1958 SC 465. The appellant therein was sentenced to imprisonment for life under Section 302 IPC for murder of the victim which was caused as a result of spear thrust and doctor who had examined the injury had opined that it was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The learned Trial Court in that case decided that the case falls under Section 300 (Thirdly) and convicted the accused under Section 302 IPC. The High Court accepted the finding but the appellant before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court stressed that an injury in a chance situation cannot amount to an offence of murder. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Virsa Singh (supra) held as under:  “. It was argued with much circumlocution that the facts set out above do not disclose an offence of murder because the prosecution has not proved that there was an intention to inflict a bodily injury that was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. Section 300 “thirdly” was uoted:  “If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury  intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.”  It was said that the intention that the section reuires must be related, not only to the bodily injury inflicted, but also to the clause, “and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.”  Observing that this is a favourite argument in this type of case, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court stated that it is fallacious. In a succinct and pithy analysis of Section 300 (Thirdly),the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Virsa Singh (supra) held as under:  “. In considering whether the intention was to inflict the injury found to have been inflicted, the enuiry necessarily proceeds on broad lines as, for eample, whether there was an intention to strie at a vital or a dangerous spot, and whether with sufficient force to cause the ind of injury found to have been inflicted. It is, of course, not necessary to enuire into every last detail as, for instance, whether the prisoner intended to have the bowels fall out, or whether he intended to penetrate the liver or the idneys or the heart. Otherwise, a man who has no nowledge of anatomy could never be convicted, for, if he does not now that there is a heart or a idney or bowels, he cannot be said to have intended to injure them. Of course, that is not the ind of enuiry. It is broadbased and simple and based on commonsense: the ind of enquiry that “twelve good men and true” could readily appreciate and understand.  .  To put it shortly, the prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case under Section “thirdly”.  .  First, it must establish, uite objectively, that a bodily injury is present.  .  Secondly, the nature of the injury must be provedThese are purely objective investigations.  .  Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other ind of injury was intended.  .  Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enuiry proceeds further and.  .  Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enuiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.  .  Once these four elements are established by the prosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the prosecution throughout) the offence is murder under Section 300 “thirdly”. It does not matter that there was no intention to cause death. It does not matter that there was no intention even to cause an injury of a ind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature (not that there is any real distinction between the two). It does not even matter that there is no nowledge that an act of that ind will be liely to cause death. Once the intention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the enuiry is purely objective and the only uestion is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. No one has a licence to run around inflicting injuries that are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and claim that they are not guilty of murder. If they inflict injuries of that ind, they must face the conseuencesand they can only escape if it can be shown, or reasonably deduced, that the injury was accidental or otherwise unintentional.”  (emphasis added)  The Hon‟ble Supreme Court further noted in Para 22 after referring to decision of Lord Goddard in R. v. Steane (1947) 1 ALL ER 813 as under:  “22. …In the absence of evidence, or reasonable  eplanation, that the prisoner did not intend to stab in the stomach with a degree of force sufficient to penetrate that far into the body, or to indicate that his act was a regrettable accident and that he intended otherwise, it would be perverse to conclude that he did not intend to inflict the injury that he did. Once that intent is established (and no other conclusion is reasonably possible in this case, and in any case it is a uestion of fact), the rest is a matter for objective determination from the medical and other evidence about the nature and seriousness of the injury.”  (emphasis added)",

                        "content": "In Pappu v. State of M.P. (2006) 7 SCC 391 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of India dealt with an incident of fatal lathi blow during an altercation between the accused and the deceased for which the accused was convicted and sentenced alongwith other co-accused under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. The argument for the accused appellant before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court was that the assault happened in the course of a sudden quarrel, there was no pre-meditation and the accused had not taken advantage or acted in a cruel manner in giving the lathi blow. The issue, therefore, revolved around in applicability of Exception (4) of Section 300 IPC. In this regard the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held as follows:  “13. The fourth eception of Section IPC covers acts done in a sudden fight. The said eception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the first eception, after which its place would have been more appropriate. The eception is founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Eception there is total deprivation of selfcontrol, in case of Eception , there is only that heat of passion which clouds mens sober reason and urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Eception as in Eception but the injury done is not the  direct conseuence of that provocation. In fact Eception deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struc, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the uarrel may have originated, yet the subseuent conduct of both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon eual footing. A “sudden fight” implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the eception more appropriately applicable would be Eception . There is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly taes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would not have taen the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The help of Eception can be invoed if death is caused (a) without premeditation(b) in a sudden fight(c) without the offenders having taen undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual mannerand (d) the fight must have been with the person illed. To bring a case within Eception all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the “fight” occurring in Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is not defined in IPC. It taes two to mae a fight. Heat of passion reuires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have wored themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden uarrel. It is a uestion of fact and whether a uarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application of Eception , it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden uarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender has not taen undue advantage or acted in  Deliberating further, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court stated in para 14 and 15 as under:  “14. It cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that whenever one blow is given, Section IPC is ruled out. It would depend upon the weapon used, the size of it in some cases, force with which the blow was given, part of the body on which it was given and several such relevant factors.”  (emphasis added)",

State of Uttaranchal (2012) 8 SCC 263 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in dealing with a fact situation where the accused gave a fatal lathi blow to the deceased as a result of a quarrel in the village fields, noted in Para 13 as under:  “. From the narration of the above facts, brought on record by the prosecution and proved in accordance with law, it is clear that there are three eyewitnesses to the occurrence. Out of them, two are injured witnesses, namely, P and P . P is the son of the deceased and P is the wife. Presence of these two witnesses at the place of occurrence is normal and natural. According to P , she had gone to the place of occurrence to give food to her husband and son around noon, which is the normal hour for lunch in the villages. The son of the deceased had come to the field with his father to wor. They were putting earth on the mend which was objected to by the accused persons who had come there with lathis and with a premeditated mind of causing harm to the deceased. Upon enuiry, the deceased informed the accused persons that the mend was a joint property of the parties. ithout provocation, the accused persons thereupon started hurling abuses upon Pyara Singh and his son, and assaulted the deceased with lathis. P and P intervened to protect their father and husband respectively, but to no conseuence and in the process, they suffered injuries. In the meanwhile, when the accused persons were challenged by P and Satnam Singh, who were close to the place of occurrence, they ran away. The presence of P , P and P cannot be doubted. The statement made by them in the court is natural, reliable and does not suffer from any serious contradictions. Once the presence of eyewitnesses cannot be doubted and it has been established that their statement is  reliable, there is no reason for the court to not rely upon the statement of such eyewitnesses in accepting the case of the prosecution. The accused persons had come with premeditated mind, together with common intention, to assault the deceased and all of them ept on assaulting the deceased till the time he fell on the ground and became breathless.”  (emphasis added)",

                        "content": "Mr. Ramesh Gupta, Senior Advocate appearing for accused No.2  placed reliance during his submissions on the following judgments:  (i)  In Krishnamurthy v. State of Karnataka MANU/SC/0248/2022 the Hon‟ble Supreme Court while deciding a criminal appeal arising out of a conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC observed as under:  “08. The underlying basic assumption or foundation in criminal law is the principle of personal culpability. A person is criminally responsible for act or transactions in which he is personally engaged or in some other way had participated. However, there are various modes and capacities in which a person can participate in a crime. He can instigate, be a facilitator or otherwise aid eecution of a crime. Section IPC incorporates the principle of shared intent, that is, common design between the two perpetrators, which maes the second or other participants also an eual or joint perpetrator as the main or principal perpetrator…          .  Section IPC maes a coperpetrator, who had participated in the offence, eually liable on the principle of joint liability. For Section to apply there should be common intention between the coperpetrators, which means that there should be community of purpose and common design or prearranged plan. However, this does not mean that coperpetrators should have engaged in any discussion, agreement or valuation. For Section  to apply, it is not necessary that the plan should be prearranged or hatched for a considerable time before the criminal act is performed. Common intention can be formed just a minute before the actual act happens. Common intention is necessarily a psychological fact as it reuires prior meeting of minds. In such cases, direct evidence normally will not be available and in most cases, whether or not there eists a common intention has to be determined by drawing  inference from the facts proved. This reuires an inuiry into the antecedents, conduct of the coparticipants or perpetrators at the time and after the occurrence. The manner in which the accused arrived, mounted the attac, nature and type of injuries inflicted, the weapon used, conduct or acts of the coassailantsperpetrators, object and purpose behind the occurrence or the attac etc. are all relevant facts from which inference has to be drawn to arrive at a conclusion whether or not the ingredients of Section IPC are satisfied. e must remember that Section IPC comes into operation against the coperpetrators because they have not committed the principal or main act, which is undertaenperformed or is attributed to the main culprit or perpetrator. here an accused is the main or final perpetrator, resort to Section IPC is not necessary as the said perpetrator is himself individually liable for having caused the injuryoffence. A person is liable for his own acts. Section or the principle of common intention is invoed to implicate and fasten joint liability on other coparticipants. Further, the expression/term “criminal act” in Section 34 IPC refers to the physical act, which has been done by the coperpetratorsparticipants as distinct from the effect, result or consequence. In other words, expression “criminal act” referred to in Section 34 IPC is different from “offence”. For eample, if A and B strie Lathi at , the criminal act is of striing lathis, whereas the offence committed may be of murder, culpable homicide or simple or grievous injuries. The expression “common intention” should also not be confused with “intention” or “mens rea” as an essential ingredient of several offences under the IPC. Intention may be an ingredient of an offence and this is a personal matter…”  (emphasis added)  However, in the opinion of this Court, Section 34 finding is appropriate and correct since all the Appellants collectively  without exception were seeking to cause injuries to the complainant, the deceased and the family. The underscored part of the judgement cited clearly states that common intention is to be inferred from the facts and can be formed a minute before the actual act.  (ii)  On the issue of nature of the injury and the intent to inflict that particular injury, reliance was placed upon Daulat Trimbak Shewale and Ors. v. State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0460/2004 where the Hon‟ble Supreme Court stated on the facts of the case which involved a fight between two groups of people that:  “8. …It is difficult to come to the conclusion that the appellants went and assaulted the deceased with the intention to ill him. If that was the intention there would have been many more injuries on other vital parts of the body, as also the fact that no attempt was made to ill the other two brothers of the deceased even though they were outnumbered. The fact that the appellants had sought police help also indicates that they did not intend to tae the law into their own hands in the first instance. Further the fact that though many of the appellants carried aes the doctor who conducted the post mortem found only one incised wound on the forehead. This also indicates that the accused persons did not really intend to ill the deceased. At the same time, it is to be noted that the prosecution has not been able to identify who really caused Injury No. which caused the death of the deceased. In such circumstances, we thin it is not safe to infer that the appellants shared a common intention of causing the death of the deceased, but it would be more appropriate to hold the appellants guilty of causing grievous hurt an offence which is punishable under Section 326 IPC.”  (iii)  Similarly, reliance was also placed on Amiruddin v. State (Delhi Admn.) MANU/SC/1313/2019 where pursuant to an exhortation, there was only one blow which had been given to the deceased with a knife but the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that:  “7. We are of the view that the fact that there was a single blow and no attempt was made to give another blow and there is no evidence to show that the Appellant was prevented from giving another blow indicate that his intention was not to ill the deceased.  .  The second aspect of the matter is whether the act of giving the blow with the nife was so imminently dangerous as to impute nowledge to the Accused that would lead to the death of the deceased. It bears repetition that one blow was given and that too at the bac. It cannot be said that the blow was so imminently dangerous as to impute nowledge to the Appellant that he was committing such an act which would cause the death of the deceased.  .  In view of the above discussion, we are of the view that the Accused should have been held guilty of committing the offence punishable Under Section Part II of Section , Indian Penal Code.”  In the opinion of this Court, these decisions do not help the appellants as there was more than one injury on the deceased and on other persons as well. Also there were clearly multiple assaults with the knives on the complainants and it was not a situation of one single unintended or accidental injury. As to who caused the specific fatal injury may not be relevant in these facts and circumstances since all the accused demonstrated a united, collective, orchestrated intent to cause injuries to the complainants.  (iv)  On the issue of sudden fight and the applicability of Exception  (4)  to Section 300 IPC, reliance was placed upon Bhagirath v. The State of Madhya PradeshMANU/SC/1208/2018 where the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that:  “7. …The fourth exception to Section 300 Indian Penal Code deals with death committed in sudden fight without premeditation. The sudden fight implies the absence of premeditation. Even as per the evidence of P, there was a wordy uarrel and in that uarrel the Appellant inflicted farsi blow on the head of the deceased. As the injuries inflicted on the deceased in the sudden fight between the deceased and the Accused party. There was no premeditation. One injury was caused to the deceased by farsi blow on the head which indicates that the Appellant has not taen undue advantage of the deceased. The manner the occurrence and the injury inflicted on the deceased attract Eception to Section . In the facts and circumstances of the case, the conviction of the Appellant is modified Under Section PartI Indian Penal Code and the sentence is reduced to the period already undergone.”  (v)  On the issue of exhortation, reliance was placed upon Matadin  v.  State of Maharashtra MANU/SC/0477/1998 where the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held as under:  “11. The courts below have not found that the language which Matadin used ehorting his fellows was used in such a tone as to ehort them to ill Asho or to cause grievous hurt to him by using dangerous weapons or means. hen the words maro sale oare used it could mean o beator even o illa person. Though the witnesses have stated that these words were used by Matadin in abusive way but from that it could not be said that he ehorted his fellows to ill Asho. e, therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence of Matadin under Section read with Section  IPC and instead convict him under Section IPC. It was stated before us that he has already undergone rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and four months. e will sentence him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for the period already undergone by him and to fine.”  In the opinion of this Court the exhortation in the facts of the instant appeals i.e. “inka aam tamam ar dete hain and saba sihate hain” was clearly an indication to cause maximum damage and injury to the victims and it was quite possible that more than one person could have been severely and fatally injured. Thus this case would not assist the appellants. Nor would Exception (4) to Section 300 IPC apply since, there was premeditation and it was not a sudden fight but a fight invited and triggered by the accused who were already armed with sharp weapons.  (vi)  The learned senior counsel also relied upon Virsa Singh (Supra) to state that the test was “21. …whether there was an intention to strie at a vital or a dangerous spot, and whether with sufficient force to cause the kind of injury found to have been inflicted…”  However, in Virsa Singh (Supra), the Hon‟ble Supreme Court after appreciating the facts stated that if there is no evidence that another kind of injury was intended as opposed to one which caused death, it can only lead to an objective analysis of the nature and seriousness of the injury. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court states as under:  “31. That is exactly the position here. No evidence or  eplanation is given about why the appellant thrust a spear into the abdomen of the deceased with such force that it penetrated the bowels and three coils of the intestines came out of the wound and that digested food oozed out from cuts in three places. In the absence of evidence, or reasonable eplanation, that the prisoner did not intend to stab in the stomach with a degree of force sufficient to penetrate that far into the body, or to indicate that his act was a regrettable accident and that he intended otherwise, it would be perverse to conclude that he did not intend to inflict the injury that he did. Once that intent is established (and no other conclusion is reasonably possible in this case, and in any case it is a uestion of fact), the rest is a matter for objective determination from the medical and other evidence about the nature and seriousness of the injury.”  (emphasis added)",

The applicants were to quote the \"concession fee\" as a percentage of gross revenue earned which was to be paid by the NDMC. The Concessionaire was to pay a sum of Rs.75 lakhs per month from the date of handing over of 5392 car parking slots. The concessionaire fee was to vary in case the car parking slots are increased or decreased. The Appellant's bid was accepted on 10.07.2017. The Appellant had quoted a concession fee of 61% of the gross revenue earned subject to minimum concession fee of Rs.75 lakhs per month for 5392 cars. As per the letter of acceptance of tender dated 10.07.2017, the Appellant was directed to submit the performance guarantee of Rs. 4 Crore within 15 days from the date of issuance of letter of acceptance. On 09.08.2017 an agreement was entered into between the Appellant and the Respondent. The agreement entered into between the parties provided for an Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism by way of Arbitration. Disputes arose between the parties. As per the NDMC, the Appellant had not paid the license fee and had been irregular in the payment of monthly license fee. On 22.02.2021, NDMC wrote a letter to the Appellant stating that the parking slots were handed over to the Appellant on 01.08.2017 and the agreement was executed on 09.08.2017 and, thereafter, some more parking lots were allotted to the Appellant on 01.07.2019. It is further mentioned in the said letter that an amount of Rs.4,06,24,007/-is due on account of non-payment/less license fee deposited by the Appellant till December 2020.

(iv)  It is further contended that Google Earth images of the alleged sites •A• and •B• of the years 2004, 2006 and 2022 make it abundantly clear that no cluster existed on the site prior to the cut-off date of 01.01.2006 as specified in Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.  Thus, the petitioners have falsely claimed to be residing at the alleged sites •A• and •B• since 1995, on the basis of which the said interim order dated 28.06.2022 was granted in their favour.  (v)  It is submitted that the alleged jhuggi jhopri bastis/clusters are not in the list of 675 notified jhuggi jhopri bastis/clusters released by Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (hereinafter referred to as •DUSIB•), wherein, jhuggi jhopri dwellers are entitled to rehabilitation as per Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board Act, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as •DUSIB Act, 2010•) and the Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as •2015 Policy•).  It is pointed out that Clause 2(a)(i) of the 2015 Policy itself clearly specifies that only those jhuggi jhopri bastis/clusters which have come up prior to 01.01.2006 shall not be removed/demolished without providing alternative housing. The contention is that since the alleged jhuggi jhopri settlements did not come up prior to 01.01.2006 (i.e. the cut-off date), therefore, it does not make the petitioners eligible for rehabilitation under the 2015 Policy.  It is further contended that the alleged clusters/settlements marked at points •A• and •B• in Annexure P-1  of the writ petition W.P.(C) 9625/2022, do not fall within the definition of •jhuggi jhopri basti• as contemplated under Section 2(g) of the DUSIB Act, 2010. It is also contended that Clusters A and B are at a significant distance from each other and the petitioner is wrongly attempting to combine two entirely distinct and separate settlements.  (vi)  Lastly, it is submitted that the petitioners have concealed that their alleged bastis/clusters are located squarely on the Yamuna floodplains, and that they are carrying out commercial and agricultural activities, rearing livestock and polluting the Yamuna River. It is strenuously contended that being located on the floodplains, the said bastis/clusters pose a threat to life, more particularly in the monsoon season.  It is further contended that the interim stay granted by this Court on 28.06.2022 is thwarting public projects and timely rejuvenation and restoration of the river Yamuna, and the same is also in contravention of the orders passed by National Green Tribunal (NGT) in a series of judgments.",

Rather, from the photographs, it appears that the subject jhuggis are touching the wall of the government accommodation which may have been allotted to government officials and whose residence along with their family members in the said accommodation may not be possible as long as the jhuggis exists. This Court, when approached cannot consider the plight of the petitioners alone and has to necessarily consider the overall situation and considering which it is felt that showing any sympathy to the petitioners will be to the prejudice of other citizens of the country including government employees who for years wait for their turn for allotment of government accommodation. Such government employees cannot be deprived of such benefit of their employment, by making the accommodation allotted to them unusable for the reason of allowing petitioners and others to surround the said accommodation with their unauthorised jhuggis.•  [emphasis supplied]",

The scope of the judgments in Ajay Maken (supra) and Sudama Singh (supra) has also been considered in the said case and it has been held as under:  •33. The reliance of the Petitioner-Union on the judgment of this Court in Ajay Maken (supra) also does not hold any water. The judgment of Ajay Maken (supra) holds to the extent that once a cluster has been identified under the DUSIB Policy, then the persons living in that JJ cluster cannot be treated as illegal encroachers and they cannot be removed from that location without being rehabilitated in accordance with the DUSIB Policy. As stated earlier, when the judgment of Sudama Singh (supra) was pronounced, there was no policy in place and this Court in Ajay Maken's case was dealing with the cluster which had been identified by the DUSIB and, therefore, the members of that cluster were entitled to the benefit of the DUSIB Policy. The learned counsel for the Petitioner has contended that a reading of paragraph 171 of the judgment of this Court in Ajay Maken (supra) indicates that the Division Bench of this Court has held that the DUSIB Policy, 2015, will apply to all the jhuggi Clusters alike and that, therefore, regardless of the fact that the present Cluster is included in the notified Cluster or not, the protection given by this Court in the judgment of Sudama Singh (supra) should be extended to the Petitioners as well. This argument does not hold water. If this submission is accepted, the entire DUSIB Policy, 2015, would be rendered infructuous, and there would have been no necessity for the DUSIB to bring out the policy restricting the right of rehabilitation only to those Clusters which were existing on 01.01.2006 and those jhuggis which were inside those Clusters as on 01.01.2015. It is the opinion of this Court that the judgment of Ajay Maken (supra) has to be read in that light. The said judgment has not rendered the DUSIB Policy, 2015, as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The purpose of the judgments passed by this Court in Sudama Singh (supra) and Ajay Maken (supra) was not to provide rehabilitation of the dwellers in the JJ Cluster even if they have encroached on government land. Encroachment on government land cannot be said to be a fundamental right of any person and a person encroaching upon government land cannot claim that he is entitled to rehabilitation as a matter of right even in the  absence of any policy bestowing the benefit of rehabilitation and relocation on the said person.•  The aforesaid judgment also takes note of and relies upon the judgment of the Division Bench in Vaishali (supra).",

It is further submitted that around 35,000 trees had to be felled by the NCRTC due to the RRTS alignment, and land within Delhi was sought by NCRTC from DDA for compensatory plantation in lieu thereof.  It is submitted that the land in question falls within the areas allocated by DDA for such compensatory plantation for NCTRC, and that a substantial amount has already been deposited by NCRTC to enable DDA to undertake the plantation and its  maintenance thereafter.  It is further submitted that such plantation can only be viably undertaken during/ around the monsoon season. It is submitted that in view of the status quo granted vide order dated 28.06.2022, DDA had to halt the compensatory plantation planned for the current monsoon season and that further delay in plantation will render the exercise impracticable, and that DDA will have to wait till the next year, which will adversely impact compensatory plantation in lieu of crucial RRTS public project. It is further submitted that the compensatory plantation is crucial for the public policy project of RRTS being carried smoothly by NCTRC, and failure to undertake compensatory plantation could thwart the timely progress of the project.",
