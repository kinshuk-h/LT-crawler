It is further submitted that the issues, as raised in the plaint, are triable issues, which can only be considered after evidence is led and cannot be adjudicated at this stage. Furthermore, since the plaintiff has suppressed material facts by editing and showing only that portion of the videos that helps its case, the plaintiff cannot be granted any protection.

It was further submitted that unlicensed reproduction in the manner that the defendants No.1 to 9 were doing, infringed the broadcasting rights of the plaintiff and had to be straightaway injuncted. Reliance has been placed on the decision of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Super Cassettes Industries Limited v. Chintamani Rao, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 4712.

Also, an attempt has been made to disparage the revenue model of the plaintiff by proclaiming that they were an „ad-free‟ news channel.  It was submitted that if the content had some problem, a complaint redressal structure under the Cable Television Networks (Amendment) Rules, 2021 was available where the defendants No.1 to 9 could have filed a complaint, but they had no right or authority to take on the mantle of a Regulator. It was submitted that the provision of Section 52 of the Copyright Act, 1957 was not available to the defendants No.1 to 9 as, firstly, the broadcasting on social-media was not included in Section 52 and even if it was, the programmes of the defendants No.1 to 9 did not reflect ―fair comment‖ and amounted to „commercial disparagement‟, which also ought to be straightaway injuncted.",

It was urged that when there was a composite suit, only a suit, which related to immovable property, would be maintainable as a commercial suit and none others. Thus, if a suit was a composite one, it had to go before the ordinary civil court. According to the learned senior counsel, though the prayer „a‟ would make out a commercial suit, since prayers „b‟ to „h‟ would make out only a civil suit for defamation and damages, therefore, this was a „composite suit‟, and had to be tried only in the ordinary civil jurisdiction and not in the special jurisdiction of the commercial courts.",

It was submitted that where the words used were very clear, there was no occasion for interpretation. Therefore, the only exception created by way of the Explanation to Section 2(1)(c) had to be read in a restrictive manner to the effect that where a commercial dispute also entailed a dispute with regard to immovable property, then alone could the suit continue before the commercial courts and not otherwise.

In this context, it was submitted that the judgment of the learned Single Judge in Super Cassettes Industries Limited v.

It was also argued that what the defendants No.1 to 9 had done was to „comment‟ on the reporting quality of the plaintiff and therefore, the content that may have been created by the plaintiff was being used only for criticism or review and thus, protected.

Definitions  (1)  In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-- (a)  xxx xxx  (b)  xxx xxx  (c)  \"commercial dispute\" means a dispute arising out  of—  (i)  ordinary transactions of merchants, bankers, financiers and traders such as those relating to mercantile documents, including enforcement and interpretation of such documents; (ii) export or import of merchandise or services;  (iii)  issues relating to admiralty and maritime law;  (iv)  transactions relating to aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and helicopters, including sales, leasing and financing of the same;  (v)  carriage of goods;  (vi)  construction and infrastructure contracts, including tenders;  (vii)  agreements relating to immovable property used exclusively in trade or commerce;  (viii)  franchising agreements;  (ix)  distribution and licensing agreements;  (x)  management and consultancy agreements;  (xi)  joint venture agreements;  (xii)  shareholders agreements;  (xiii)  subscription and investment agreements pertaining to the services industry including outsourcing services and financial services;  (xiv)  mercantile agency and mercantile usage;  (xv)  partnership agreements;  (xvi)  technology development agreements;  (xvii)  intellectual property rights relating to registered and unregistered trademarks, copyright, patent, design, domain names, geographical indications and semiconductor integrated circuits;  (xviii)  agreements for sale of goods or provision of services;  (xix)  exploitation of oil and gas reserves or other natural resources including electromagnetic spectrum;  (xx)  insurance and re-insurance;  (xxi)  contracts of agency relating to any of the above; and  (xxii)  such other commercial disputes as may be notified by the Central Government.

What would be the actual dispute in respect of ordinary transactions of merchants, or export and import of merchandise, or carriage of goods, or construction and infrastructure, and so on and so forth, would remain what would arise in ordinary course between two parties in the course of these engagements and activities. Thus, such a dispute could be a breach of contract or the enforcement of terms of contract entailing recovery not only of the price, but possibly damages; disputes may relate to mutual rights or obligations under Joint Venture Agreements or rights and obligations in respect of Consultancy Agreements; disputes arising out of technology development agreements could entail rights to the sharing of the know-how and/or confidentiality, and so on and so forth.

It was held by the Supreme Court that a narrow interpretation alone would give effect to the object for which the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was enacted and by allowing all sorts of disputes in respect of all immovable property, which was not in the presenti in actual use exclusively in trade or  commerce, the very purpose would be defeated. The observations may be reproduced fruitfully as under:- ―14. In that view it is also necessary to carefully examine and entertain only disputes which actually answers the definition ―commercial disputes‖ as provided under the Act. In the instant case, as already taken note neither the agreement between the parties refers to the nature of the immovable property being exclusively used for trade or commerce as on the date of the agreement nor is there any pleading to that effect in the plaint. Further the very relief sought in the suit is for execution of the mortgage deed which is in the nature of specific performance of the terms of Memorandum of Understanding without reference to nature of the use of the immovable property in trade or commerce as on the date of the suit.

Are they altogether too many and too long to be fair? Then you must consider the use made of them. If they are used as a basis for comment, criticism or review, that may be fair dealing. If they are used to convey the same information as the author, for a rival purpose, that may be unfair. Next, you must consider the proportions. To take long extracts and attach short comments may be unfair. But, short extracts and long comments may be fair. Other considerations may come to mind also. But, after all is said and done, it must be a matter of impression. As with fair comment in the law of libel, so with fair dealing in the law of copyright. The tribunal of fact must decide.

                        "content": "Two decisions of Co-ordinate Benches of this Court have been relied upon by the plaintiff, namely, (i) Super Cassettes Industries Ltd. v. Hamar Television Network Pvt. Ltd., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 2086 and (ii) Super Cassettes Industries Limited v. Chintamani Rao, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 4712, to contend that the use by the defendants No.1 to 9 of the contents created and produced by the plaintiff do not fit the bill of  ―fair dealing‖. The learned Single Judge in Super Cassettes Industries Ltd. v. Hamar Television Network Pvt. Ltd., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 2086 discussed various decisions and summarized the broad principles of law in para No.8, as below:- ―8. If I may summarise the broad principles of law which have enunciated in the judgments cited before me on the aspect of ―fair dealing‖. These appear to be as follows:—  (i)  It is neither possible nor advisable to define the exact contours of fair dealing;  (ii)  It is a question of fact, degree, and at the end of the day overall impression carried by the court;  (iii)  In ascertaining whether extracts taken from copyrighted work have been put to fair use, the extent and the length of the extracts may be relevant. Long extracts followed by short comments may in certain circumstances be unfair, while short extracts followed by long comments may be fair. In certain circumstances even small extracts, which are taken, on regular basis may point to unfair use of the copyrighted work.  (iv)  The right to make fair use or to deal fairly with the copyrighted work includes the right to criticize not only the style, but also as the underlying doctrine or philosophy of the copyrighted work. In this regard criticism could be both ―strong‖ and ―unbalanced‖. Such criticism by itself will not result in forfeiture of the defence of fair dealing. Malicious and unjustified criticism may give to the aggrieved party a cause for instituting an action for defamation but it would certainly not confer a right founded in copyright.  (v)  In ascertaining as to what would constitute reportage of ―current events‖ or would fall within the ambit of ―criticism‖ or ―review‖, Courts ought to adopt a liberal approach;  (vi)  In discerning as to whether a person has made fair use of copyrighted work, the standard employed ought to be that of a ―fair minded‖ and ―honest person‖. In the case of musical works the test would be that of a ―lay hearer‖  (vii)  While examining the defence of fair dealing, the length and the extent of the copyrighted work which is made use of, as indicated in clause 3 above, is important, however, it cannot be reduced just a quantitative test without having regard to the qualitative aspect. In other words, enquiry ought to be made as to whether the impugned extract forms an essential part of the work of the person in whom inheres the copyright. This may be particularly true in the case of musical works where a few notes may make all the difference;  (viii)  Even though copyrighted work may contain confidential information, the courts would desist from injuncting the use of such work if it is in public weal. Though there is a difference between a breach of confidence as against infringement of copyright, the Court would not grant an injunction in favour of the person in whom inheres the copyright if it is contrary to public policy, that is, is:  (a)  immoral;  (b)  scandalous;  (c)  contrary to family life;  (d)  injurious to public life, public health, safety or, is inimical to administration of justice; and  (e)  incites an action which endangers (c) and (d) above.  (ix)  The principle of freedom of expression will protect both information and ideas. Freedom of expression includes the right to publish and receive information. Public interest may in certain circumstances be so overwhelming that courts would not refrain from injuncting use of even ―leaked information‖ or even the right to use the ―very words‖ in which the aggrieved person has copyright, as at times, public interest may demand the use of the ―very words‖ to convey the message to public at large. While the courts may desist from granting injunction based on the principle of freedom of expression, this would, however, not necessarily protect the infringer in an action instituted on behalf of the person in whom the copyright vests for damages and claim for an account of profits;  (x)  Public interest and what the interests the public need not be the same:  (xi)  The motive of the user shall play an important role in assessing as to whether injunction ought to be granted;  (xii)  Commercial use of copyrighted work cannot simplicitor make it unfair; and  (xiii)  Lastly, ―transformative use‖ may be deemed in certain situations as fair use of copyrighted work;‖",

Chintamani Rao, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 4712 had been set  aside, there is force in the submissions made by learned counsel for the plaintiff that the discussion on ―fair dealing‖ could be referred to profitably even if the final relief was declined. It is considered apposite to reproduce para No.27 thereof as below:- ―27. Before I proceed to deal with the case law cited by the parties and examine the position on facts, I think it appropriate to make a few preliminary observations according to my understanding of the statutory position on a plain reading of Section 52 of the Act. What Section 52(1)(a) permits is that the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work may be reproduced without fear of infringement of copyright in such works, if such reproduction is a fair dealing of the copyright work in question, for the purpose of criticism or review whether of that work or any other work. Therefore, firstly it has to be ―fair dealing‖ of the work in question. This means that the dealing with the copyrighted work is not an unfair dealing. Only that part of the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work may be utilized for the purpose of criticism or review, which is absolutely necessary, and no more. The purpose -ostensibly or obliquely, should not be to ride piggy back on the work of another. The focus of attention, and interest of the producer/author of the work and the viewer/listener should not be the work of another, but the work created by the person who may, bona fide be using the work of another for the specific purpose of criticism or review of that work, or of any other work. The work of another cannot be used for any other purpose. The copyright protected work of another cannot be used out of context. There has to be an intellectual input and an original mental exercise undertaken by the person bona fide lifting or copying the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, which should involve either the  criticism or review of the lifted/copied work, or of any other work. Copying of the work of another for any other purpose, such as, to make one's own programme more interesting, attractive or enjoyable is not permitted. The underlying theme and focus of; and, in substance, the new work should necessarily be an exercise to either criticize or review either the bona fide copied work, or any other work. A person cannot, in the name of ―fair dealing‖, lift or copy literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work of another to such an extent that it ceases to be a ―fair dealing‖ and becomes a blatant act of copying the work of another.‖",

The court would then look into the validity of the defence raised on parameters, such as, whether the comments were devoid of malice; they were honestly made; and in public interest; the reproduction was of short excerpts; there was some creative input of the copier/reproducer; they constituted criticism and review, and there was no blatant act of copying. But as observed in Hubbard (supra), these are all questions of fact and have to be decided by the Trial Court. One of the pleas urged by the defendants No.1 to 9 is that though they were using excerpts from the programmes of the plaintiff, they were doing so with an intent to comment and remove bias from reporting, which was in public interest, and there was „transformative use‟ inasmuch as the excerpts were superimposed with the comments by the defendant No.5/Manisha Pandey (Newsance) and the defendant No.8/Atul Chaurasia (Tippani).

The Financial Reporting Council, [2018] EWHC 1662 (Admin). In India too, it has been held that right to reputation is sacrosanct. In Subramanium Swamy (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with the constitutional validity of Section 499 and Section 500 IPC has recognized „reputation‟ as being an inherent component of Article 21 of the Constitution and that no one could be allowed to sully the reputation of another by claiming the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution of India.",

While claiming to be the best, any statement about a competitor‟s goods, which could be untrue or misleading and is made to  influence or tend to influence the public, would amount to disparagement. This has been the view taken in Reckitt Benckiser India Private Limited Vs. Hindustan Unilever Limited 2021 SCC OnLine Del 4896, though in the context of comparative advertisements. Competitive advertisements are permissible as held in Tata Press Limited Vs. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and Others (1995) 5 SCC 139, as advertising is essential for economic activity. It informs the consumers of the existence of various goods and services, the quality of these products and services, the product origin etc. It also builds up reputation. It is in this context that the Supreme Court held that ―commercial speech‖ is a part of the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the constitution.",

Since it is the case of the plaintiff that the video is in response to the advertisement of the plaintiff, the video though of some length can also be considered as an audiovisual advertisement of the defendants, to assure their students and their parents of the quality of education imparted in their institutions.

Hindustan Coca Cola Ltd., 2003 SCC OnLine Del 802 to decide the question of disparagement, namely (i) intent of the commercial; (ii) manner of the commercial; (iii) storyline of the commercial and the message sought to be conveyed by the commercial.

In other words, the programmes of the defendants No.1 to 9 must not be showing the plaintiff‟s programmes in poor light, asking viewers to stop watching the plaintiff‟s channels while claiming their own to be the best. This, of course, will again be a question of fact as to whether commercial disparagement has occurred or not.

Antox India (P) Ltd., 1990 Supp SCC 727 may be reproduced profitably, which are as follows:  “9. Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injunction, it is stated  ―...is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such protection must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the ‗balance of convenience‘ lies.‖  The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie case. The court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales,  as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted.‖",

In Secy., Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Govt. of India v.

Quite clearly, the right to broadcast programmes would be included in the right to free speech and expression. As has been held in Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (1962) 3 SCR 842, the right to free speech and expression carries with it the right to publish and circulate one‟s ideas, opinions and views with complete freedom and by resorting to the  available means of publication, which, in the opinion of this Court, would also mean and include not only the electronic media and T.V. channels, but also the social-media platforms as the object of publication and broadcast is the same i.e., to reach out to the public.",

The old Bonnard Principle which set the high thresh-hold for grant of injunction restraining publications on the ground of defamation and harm to the reputation, has been watered-down by the courts, as noticed above. The right to free speech is an important right, but reputation is an equally important right. The courts, over a period of time, have pronounced that reputation is an internal and central facet of right to life, as protected under Article 21 of the Constitution. Thus, a balance would have to be struck between the two rights, one under Article 19(1)(a) and the other under Article 21 of the Constitution.",

It is obvious that there can be no “free for all” in the regulatory sphere. Every individual or organization cannot claim authority to regulate – the chaos can be imagined – there will be only regulators and none willing to bide by regulations!!

But that would be the opinion of the defendants No.1 to 9. The plaintiff may have a contrary view regarding the prioritization and presentation of current events by the defendants No.1 to 9. Therefore, ex facie, there is no public interest in the particular programming of the content and broadcast of such content by the defendants No.1 to 9.

Dissemination of a spectrum of information by many players would result in a better informed society.

This is countered by the defendants No.1 to 9 saying that they were justified in their comment.

State of W.B., (2020) 12 SCC 436 sought the fullest liberty to critique and criticize, through satire, the programmes of the plaintiff. While freedom of expression would include the art of satire, it must be evident that what was being presented is  indeed satire. It must be self-evident and by its very character can never be a case of copyright infringement or defamation or even disparagement. Satire cannot be explained or else it would lose its flavour. Satire allows the satirist to criticize in the harshest of terms and critique actions of all, particularly of those in positions of power and/or authority and leadership. The intention of the satirist is to simultaneously highlight an action and its negative fallout, so that rectificatory action could be taken. It is never intended to disparage or harm reputation and thus is completely devoid of malice. Satirists, at all times in our culture, have been greatly respected and there are several art forms in this country that allowed such criticism of even the Rulers in the heydays of Monarchy and which art forms still exist. Examples, that come to mind are “Ottamthullal” and the “Chakiyaarkoothu”, both in Kerala. Sharp use of language conveys the message intended by the artists, but in a cultured and nuanced manner. Such creative genre must, without doubt, be encouraged and protected. Since the defendants No.1 to 9 claim their programme is satire, they need to explain which one of their programmes is “satire”, what portion is “comment” and what justified “criticism”.

                        "content": "On these facts, which have been noted, it cannot be denied that a ―prima facie case‖ is disclosed. But disclosure of a prima facie case alone will not entitle a plaintiff to interim injunction. The other two requirements of ―balance of convenience‖ and ―irreparable loss and injury‖ will need to be established before such injunction can be granted. Since ―justification‖ and ―fair dealing‖ have been pleaded as defence, and such defence is based on facts, the defendants No.1 to 9 have to be  given an opportunity to prove justification during trial. Furthermore, the extent of infringement or fair use for fair comment and criticism would also be a matter of trial as each video would have to be considered to determine whether the excerpts are significant to be outright copying, or constitute fair use without infringement. The contents of the individual videos, the articles, the Facebook and Instagram posts will have to be looked into individually to determine if they contain malicious, dishonest, defamatory and disparaging statements or constitute honest and possible satirical opinion. In short, the decision has to be deferred till after the conclusion of the trial.",

                        "content": "The ―balance of convenience‖ would, therefore, tilt in favour of the defendants No.1 to 9 as, in the event they are able to establish justification and fair comment and fair dealing, the plaintiff would fail, both in respect of their claim against copyright infringement/broadcast right violation as also defamation/disparagement. If there is no justification, there could probably be no fair comment either and thus no defence against defamation either. Moreover, no injunction in futuro can be issued, as has been held in Khushwant Singh (supra) and R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N., (1994) 6 SCC 632. Admittedly, some of the videos and articles and posts in question, have been in existence since 2018 and hence, no real urgency has been shown even for the removal of even those words noted hereinbefore, by issuing mandatory injunctions to take them down. It must be kept in mind that a mandatory injunction is issued at the interim stage only in rare and extraordinary situations. It would be useful to reproduce the guidelines of the Supreme Court  recorded in its decision in Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden, (1990) 2 SCC 117, which are as under:  ―16. The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are:  (1)  The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it shall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally required for a prohibitory injunction.  (2)  It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which normally cannot be compensated in terms of money.  (3)  The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking such relief.",

Though the above guidelines are neither exhaustive nor complete or absolute rules, and there may be exceptional circumstances needing action, applying them as prerequisite for the grant or refusal of such injunctions would be a sound exercise of a judicial discretion.‖ (emphasis added)",

Were the defendants No.1 to 9 to succeed in their defence, the harm caused to the defendants No.1 to 9 would outweigh the loss caused to the plaintiff. This is so also because the plaintiff would be entitled to be compensated with damages, which the plaintiff has actually quantified to the tune of Rs.2,00,00,100/-(Rupees Two crores and one hundred). Thus, no ―irreparable loss or injury‖ that cannot be recompensed by damages will be caused to the plaintiff in the absence of the interim injunction.",

                        "content": "Mr Agarwal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the IPAB had erred in proceedings on the basis that the decision of the Supreme Court restricted the discretion of IPAB to implead M/s Jain Industries to decide the issue of a non-user in accordance with law. He contended that the Supreme Court had  remanded the case to IPAB to decide the same in the light of the principles explained by it. According to him, this enjoined IPAB to determine the applications afresh and if required, to implead all necessary parties. He further submitted that the petitioner could not be faulted for not impleading M/s Jain Industries in the first instance as the Supreme Court had in its decision, for the first time, observed that where an allegation of trafficking are made, both the original registrant as well as assignee are required to be impleaded as a parties. He submitted that prior to the said decision, the law did not require the original registrant to be impleaded as a party in any case where the applicant was challenging the assignment on the ground of trafficking. He submitted that the person who is registered as the proprietor at the material time is required to be arrayed as a respondent. He also stated that the petitioner was not seeking any relief against M/s Jain Industries and the same was also one of the reasons by IPAB had rejected the petitioner•s application for impleading M/s Jain Industries. He submitted that this ran contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court, which required the original proprietor to also be impleaded where an allegation of trafficking was made. He submitted that in this view, the failure of petitioner to implead M/s Jain Industries at the material time could not be held against it. Lastly, he submitted that in terms of Section 46(1)(b) of the Act, a proprietor •for the time being• would alone appear to be a necessary party for adjudication of a rectification application, which is premised on the basis of non-user for a continuous period of five years. He submitted that in this view, M/s Jain Industries was not impleaded as a party at  the material time. However, in view of the decision of the Supreme Court, which was rendered subsequently, it is necessary to implead M/s Jain Industries. He submitted that in terms of Order 1 Rule 10(2) of CPC, the IPAB could suo moto implead M/s Jain Industries as it had power to effectively and completely to adjudicate the disputes.",

                        "content": "In order to address the controversy, it would be relevant to briefly take note of the controversy in the first round. The IPAB had dismissed the rectification petition (C.O. No. 6/1987) by an order dated 27th October, 2004. The petitioner had claimed that since M/s Jain Industries had not used the trademark in question for a period of five years and one month, the registration in its favour was liable to be rectified in accordance with Section 46(1)(b) of the Act, notwithstanding that the said trademark had been assigned to Thukral. The IPAB did not accept the petitioner•s contention and held that Thukral had become the proprietor of the trademark on 30th May, 1986 and the rectification petition was filed on 19th January, 1987, that is, after the period of about seven and a half months of alleged non-use  by Thukral; thus, the requirements of Section 46(1)(b) of the Act were not fulfilled. The IPAB was of the view that period of five years and one month of non use of a trademark, which would give the ground for rectification of the said trademark, was required to be considered with reference to the registered proprietor•s use of the trademark and not the assignor from whom it was acquired. In other words, the IPAB held that the non use of trademark by M/s Jain Industries would not affect the assignment in favour of Thukral and the registration could be rectified under Section 46(1)(b) of the Act, only if the last proprietor (that is, Thukral) had not used the trademark for a period of five years and one month, prior to the date of the application. Admittedly, this condition was not met and therefore, IBAB dismissed the rectification petition.",

This Court did not concur with the IPAB•s aforesaid view. It held that the non use of the trademark during the period prior to assignment of the trademark in favour of Thukral was not inconsequential. It held that a plain reading of Section 46(1)(b) of the Act indicated that a registered trademark could be taken off from the register if it had not been used for a minimum continuous period of five years and one month before the date of application of its removal. It held that M/s Jain Industries (the registered proprietor of the trademark) had not used the trademark at all. The trademark in question was only used by the petitioner and Thukral, neither of whom  were proprietors of the trademark except that Thukral claimed to have become the proprietor with effect from 30th May, 1986. The Court held that prior to the said date the use of the trademark by Thukral, if at all, was not legally permissible. This Court did not accept that period of five years and one month was required to be considered from the date on which Thukral became the proprietor of the trademark (that is 30th May, 1986). This Court was of the view that the period of non use would also include the period when M/s Jain Industries was the registered proprietor of the said trademark. Accordingly, this Court, by a judgment dated 18.01.2006 rendered in CW no. 19632/2004 set aside the order dated 27th October, 2004 passed by the IPAB and remanded the matter to the IPAB to be considered on merits.

The Supreme Court did not concur with the view of this Court that the period of five years and one month would also include the period when M/s Jain Industries was the proprietor of the trademark in question. The Supreme Court reasoned that non-user of a trademark entails consequences laid down under Clause (b) of Sub Section (1) of  Section 46 of the Act and when an application seeking rectification of the trademark is filed under the said Section, the proprietor of the trademark has the opportunity to show that his case falls under the purview of Sub-section (3) of Section 46 of the Act. He alone can prove that he has a bona fide intention to use the trademark. The relevant extract of the decision of the Supreme Court is set out below:- •19. There cannot be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right. The person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner. It confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered. The same is an assignable right in terms of Section 36 of the Act, whereas an unregistered trade mark is not.",

At the time of grant of original registration, advertisements are issued and objections are called for. Renewal of registration, in a sense, also is not automatic.

The relevant extract of the decision of the Supreme Court is set out below:- •32. Our attention has again been drawn to a passage from •Law of Trade marks & Geographical  Indications• by Shri K.C. Kailasam, wherein the judgment of the Tribunal has been criticized in the following terms :  •From the above legislative intent, it would seem that the period of non-use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration. In the case of American Home Products Corporation v. Mac Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. Rendered under the 1958 Act, it was held by the Supreme Court that •the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove such continuous non-user.• It would appear that neither the U.K. Act, nor the Indian Act, at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non-use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark, so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration, every-time there is change in the ownership of the mark. If that be so, any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in section 47(1)(a) and (b). Further, it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to •the provisions of the Act and any rights vested in any other person• --See section 37. The assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the Act.•  •33. We do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct. An assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses. If his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non-user of the trade mark for a period of five years,  any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra.•",

Mr Lall contended that it was the petitioner•s case that the assignment of the trademark was mala fide and to frustrate the provisions of law. However, a bare perusal of the application indicates that the principal ground urged by the petitioner in its application is that the registration of the trademark in favour of M/s Jain Industries was liable to be rectified as the same had not been used for a period of five years and one month. Although the petitioner has also averred that the assignment of the trademark was mala fide, a close examination of the pleadings indicates that it is not the petitioner•s contention that  there was any trafficking of the trademark or that Thukral was squatting on the same. On the contrary, it is an admitted case that Thukral was using the trademark in respect of its goods (although it is contended that the same amounted to infringement of the petitioner•s trademark). The petitioner had alleged that Thukral had secured an assignment of the said trademark to frustrate the petitioner•s suit for infringement. The contention that M/s Jain Industries and Thukral had been trafficking in the trademark and had registered the same without the intention to use it and that the trademark had been assigned only for the purpose of keeping the registration alive without any intention of using the same, is inconsistent with the case set up by the petitioner.
