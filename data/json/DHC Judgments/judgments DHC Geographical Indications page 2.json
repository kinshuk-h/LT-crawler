This Court had noticed that Chapter XVI and Section 140 of the Patents Act contained provisions the subject matter of which may be common with the Competition Act. Section 84 of the Patents Act provides for grant of compulsory licenses in certain cases where reasonable requirement of public in respect of patented inventions has not been satisfied. Section 85 of the Patents Act provides for revocation of patents if after expiry of two years from the date of grant of compulsory license, the patented invention has not been worked in the territory of India and the reasonable requirements of public with respect to the patent have not been satisfied. The instances listed out in Section 84(7) of the Patents Act can in certain circumstances be considered as an abuse of dominance if the patentee is dominant in the relevant market. Section 4 of the Competition Act contains provisions, which indicate abuse of a dominant position by an enterprise. And, Section 27 of the Competition Act provides for orders that can be passed by the CCI in cases where it finds that any enterprise has violated provisions of Section 3 and Section 4 of the Competition Act. This Court had after examining the various provisions of the two enactments, concluded that the orders that can be passed by the CCI under Section 27 of the Competition Act in respect of abuse of dominant position by any enterprise are materially different from the remedies that are available under Section 84 of the Patents Act. This court also observed that in certain case it may be  open for a prospective licensee to approach the Controller for grant of a compulsory license.

(supra) • which is relied upon by the petitioner • the Supreme Court did not accept the contention that the jurisdiction of the CCI was ousted by virtue of the telecom industry being regulated by a statutory body (TRAI). Although the functions of TRAI include regulation of the telecom industry and would encompass all aspects of the telecom industry, the Supreme Court, nonetheless, held that the focus of the Competition Act was different and was restricted to regulating and promoting a free market. The Supreme Court noticed that the Competition Act dealt with three kinds of practices, which are treated as anti-competitive and are prohibited: (a) where agreements are entered into by certain persons with a view to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition; (b) where an enterprise or group of enterprises, which enjoys dominant position abuses the said dominant position; and (c) regulating the combination of enterprises by means of mergers or amalgamations to ensure that such mergers or amalgamations are not anti-competitive or result in an abuse of the dominant position, which may be resultantly attained. The Court noticed that the CCI has been entrusted with a function to deal with the aforesaid kind of anti-competitive conduct and to the aforesaid  extent, the functions assigned to the CCI were distinct from the function of TRAI under the TRAI Act. In this view, the Supreme Court did not accept the contention that the jurisdiction of the CCI in respect of matters, which are regulated by a specialised statutory body, were excluded from the applicability of the Competition Act. Thus, this decision does not support the petitioner•s contention that the Patents Act being a special act in respect of patents excludes the applicability of the Competition Act in respect of the matters that relate to patents on account of any implicit repugnancy.

He contended that the clause (i) of sub-section (5) of Section 3 of the Competition Act has two limbs.

(supra) was delivered in the context of the specific disputes that had arisen between Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd. (RJIL) and the specific role of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in regulating the said industry. TRAI is a statutory body constituted under the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 (TRAI Act). Section 11 of the said Act sets out the functions that are to be performed by TRAI. In terms of Section 11 of TRAI Act, TRAI is charged to perform two kinds of functions: recommendatory functions and regulatory functions. Clause (a) of Section 11 of the said Act lists out the recommendatory functions of TRAI. In terms of clause (a) of Section 11, TRAI is required to make recommendations, either suo moto or on request of the licensor (Government of India), on the matters as listed therein. Clause (b) of Section 11 of the TRAI Act sets out the other functions that are required to be performed by TRAI. Section 11(1) of the TRAI Act is set out below:- •(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (13 of 1885), the functions of the Authority shall be to- (a)  make recommendations, either suo motu or on a request from the licensor, on the following matters, namely:-- (i)  need and timing for introduction of new service provider;  (ii)  terms and conditions of licence to a service provider;  (iii)  revocation of license for non-compliance of terms and conditions of licence;  (iv)  measures to facilitate competition and promote efficiency in the operation of telecommunication services so as to facilitate growth in such services;  (v)  technological improvements in the services provided by the service providers;  (vi)  type of equipment to be used by the service providers after inspection of equipment used in the network;  (vii)  measures for the development of telecommunication technology and any other matter relatable to telecommunication industry in general;  (viii)  efficient management of available spectrum;  (b)  discharge the following functions, namely:-- (i)  ensure compliance of terms and conditions of licence;  (ii)  notwithstanding anything contained in the terms and conditions of the licence granted before the commencement of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Act, 2000 (2 of 2000), fix the terms and conditions of inter-connectivity between the service providers;  (iii)  ensure technical compatibility and effective interconnection between different service providers;  (iv)  regulate arrangement amongst service providers of sharing their revenue derived from providing telecommunication services;  (v)  lay-down the standards of quality of service to be provided by the service providers and ensure the quality of service and conduct the periodical survey of such service provided by the service providers so as to protect interest of the consumers of telecommunication service;  (vi)  lay-down and ensure the time period for providing local and long distance circuits of telecommunication between different service providers;  (vii)  maintain register of inter-connect agreements and of all such other matters as may be provided in the regulations;  (viii)  keep register maintained under clause (vii) open for inspection to any member of public on payment of such fee and compliance of such other requirement as may be provided in the regulations;  (ix)  ensure effective compliance of universal service obligations;  (c)  levy fees and other charges at such rates and in respect of such services as may be determined by regulations;  (d)  perform such other functions including such administrative and financial functions as may be entrusted to it by the Central Government or as may be  necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act:  Provided that the recommendations of the Authority specified in clause (a) of this sub-section shall not be binding upon the Central Government:  Provided further that the Central Government shall seek the recommendations of the Authority in respect of matters specified in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (a) of this sub-section in respect of new licence to be issued to a service provider and the Authority shall forward its recommendations within a period of sixty days from the date on which that Government sought the recommendations:  Provided also that the Authority may request the Central Government to furnish such information or documents as may be necessary for the purpose of making recommendations under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (a) of this sub-section and that Government shall supply such information within a period of seven days from receipt of such request:  Provided also that the Central Government may issue a licence to a service provider if no recommendations are received from the Authority within the period specified in the second proviso or within such period as may be mutually agreed upon between the Central Government and the Authority:  Provided also that if the Central Government, having considered that recommendation of the Authority, comes to a prima facie conclusion that such recommendation cannot be accepted or needs modifications, it shall refer the recommendation back to the Authority for its reconsideration, and the Authority may, within fifteen days from the date of receipt of such reference, forward to the Central  Government its recommendation after considering the reference made by that Government. After receipt of further recommendation if any, the Central Government shall take a final decision.•",

Telecom services are regulated and controlled and TRAI has a vital role in regulating the industry. As noticed above, the nature of functions of TRAI are twofold. The first is recommendatory in nature. TRAI is required to make recommendations to the licensor on the matters as specified in Section 11(a) of the TRAI. Thus, matters that relate to licensing between the licensor and the service provider are squarely covered at the said level. In addition to the above, TRAI is required to perform other functions for regulating the telecom services. The TRAI•s scope of regulation is all pervasive. In exercise of its powers, TRAI has made several Regulations, which are required to be complied with. TRAI also fixes the tariff for interconnection. Thus, the issue whether adequate number of POIs had been provided by service providers for connecting with the service rolled out by RJIL fell squarely within the scope of regulatory powers of TRAI and TRAI was required to determine it. A Controller does not regulate the exercise of patent rights in such pervasive manner. This is for an obvious reason that patents is not an industry. Grant of a Patent recognizes and confers an intellectual property right. The principal function of the Controller  under the Patents Act is to examine the application for grant of patents and grant patents if the applicant is entitled to such rights. Although, the Controller also exercises other powers and performs other functions, including issuance of compulsory licenses in given case. But the Controller does not regulate, in a pervasive manner, the exercise of patent rights or the agreements that are entered into by patentees with third parties. The nature of the role performed by a Controller, thus, cannot be equated to that as performed by the TRAI.",

There are certain technical aspects relating to the telecom industry where TRAI has domain expertise. In Bharti Airtel•s case one of the principal questions to be addressed was whether the service provider had provided sufficient number of POIs for interconnecting with the services rolled out by RJIL. The question whether the number of POIs were sufficient was clearly required to be technically evaluated. In this context, the Supreme Court held that this would be best done by the TRAI, which had the domain expertise. And, the examination by the CCI ought to be deferred till the technical aspects (which formed the factual basis on which the complaints before the CCI were founded), were determined. The decision of the Supreme Court in Bharti Airtel Ltd. (supra) is certainly not an authority for the proposition that wherever there is a statutory regulator, the complaint must be first  brought before the Regulator and examination of a complaint by the CCI is contingent on the findings of the Regulator.",

Ld. counsel urges that the nature of grounds which are raised by the Opponent for opposing the grant of patents being quite broad in nature, for example, prior public use, source of original biological material, prior knowledge, etc., collection of documents and evidence is a continuous process which ought to be flexible  till the final hearing is concluded before the Controller.",

The grounds for filing pre-grant oppositions are stipulated in Section 25(1) of the Act. The grounds for filing post-grant oppositions are stipulated in Section 25(2) of the Act. A pre-grant opposition can be filed by any person whereas a post-grant opposition can be filed by any “person interested”.

Opposition to the patent.—  (2)  At any time after the grant of patent but before the expiry of a period of one year from the date of publication of grant of a patent, any person interested may give notice of opposition to the Controller in the prescribed manner on any of the following grounds, namely:—  (a)  that the patentee or the person under or through whom he claims, wrongfully obtained the invention or any part thereof from him or from a person under or through whom he claims; (b) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification has been published before the priority date of the  claim—  (i)  in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India on or after the 1st day of January, 1912; or  (ii)  in India or elsewhere, in any other document:  Provided that the ground specified in sub-clause (ii) shall not be available where such publication does not constitute an anticipation of the invention by virtue of sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 29;  (c)  that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is claimed in a claim of a complete specification published on or after the priority date of the claim of the patentee and filed in pursuance of an application for a patent in India, being a claim of which the priority date is earlier than that of the claim of the patentee;  (d)  that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of that claim.  Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause, an invention relating to a process for which a patent is granted shall be deemed to have been publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim if a product made by that process had already been imported into India before that date except where such importation has been for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only;  (e)  that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is obvious and clearly does not involve any inventive step, having regard to the matter published as mentioned in clause (b) or having regard to what was used in India before the priority date of the applicant‟s claim;  (f)  that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not an invention within the meaning of this Act, or is not patentable under this Act;  (g)  that the complete specification does not sufficiently  and clearly describe the invention or the method by which it is to be performed;  (h)  that the patentee has failed to disclose to the Controller the information required by section 8 or has furnished the information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge;  (i)  that in the case of a patent granted on a convention application, the application for patent was not made within twelve months from the date of the first application for protection for the invention made in a convention country or in India by the patentee or a person from whom he derives title;  (j)  that the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly mentions the source and geographical origin of biological material used for the invention;  (k)  that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral or otherwise, available within any local or indigenous community in India or elsewhere,  but on no other ground.  (3)  (a) Where any such notice of opposition is duly given under sub-section (2), the Controller shall notify the patentee.  (b)  On receipt of such notice of opposition, the Controller shall, by order in writing, constitute a Board to be known as the Opposition Board consisting of such officers as he may determine and refer such notice of opposition along with the documents to that Board for examination and submission of its recommendations to the Controller.  (c)  Every Opposition Board constituted under clause  (b)  shall conduct the examination in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed.  (4)  On receipt of the recommendation of the Opposition Board and after giving the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard, the Controller shall order either to maintain or to amend or to revoke  the patent.  (5)  While passing an order under sub-section (4) in respect of the ground mentioned in clause (d) or clause  (e)  of sub-section (2), the Controller shall not take into account any personal document or secret trial or secret use.  (6)  In case the Controller issues an order under subsection (4) that the patent shall be maintained subject to amendment of the specification or any other document, the patent shall stand amended accordingly. ..”",

Controller of Patents and Designs And Ors AIR 2009 SC 405, held as under:  “22. Applying the above tests to the present case, we find that by Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 for the first time a dichotomy was inserted in the Patent Law by providing vide Section 25(1) for \"opposition to pre-grant\" and vide Section 25(2) for \"opposition to post-grant\" of patent.… Previously, there was no \"post-grant opposition…. There is, however, a radical shift due to incorporation of Section 25(2) where an interested party is granted the right to challenge the patent after its grant….However, Section 25(1) is wider than Section 25(2) as the latter is available only to a \"person aggrieved\". The main difference between Section 25(1) and Section 25(2), as brought about by Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, is that even after a patent is granted, \"post-grant opposition\" can be filed under Section 25(2) for a period of one year. The reason is obvious. In relation to patents that are of recent origin, a higher scrutiny is necessary. This is the main rationale underlying Section 25(2) of the said 1970 Act. Therefore, the Legislature intended an appeal under Section 117A(2) to the Appellate Board from any decision, order or direction of the Controller, inter alia, under Section 25(4) [which refers to the power of the Controller to maintain, amend or revoke the patent].”",

                        "content": "In the first instance a distinction has to be drawn between a pre-grant opposition and a post-grant opposition. While a pre-grant opposition can be filed under Section 25(1) of the Patents Act at any time after the publication of the patent application but before the grant of a patent, a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) of the Patents Act has to be filed before the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the grant of patent. A second significant difference, after the amendment of 2005, is that a pre-grant opposition can be filed by any person. whereas a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) can be filed only by any person interested.. It may be noticed that the application for revocation of a patent in terms of Section 64 of the Patents Act can also to be filed only by any person interested.. In other words, the post-grant opposition and the application for revocation cannot be filed by just about any person who is not shown to be a person who is interested. A third significant difference is that the representation at the stage of pre-grant is considered by the Controller himself. Rule 55 of the Patents Rules requires the Controller to consider the statement and evidence filed by the applicant. and thereafter either refuse to grant the patent or require the complete specification to be amended to his satisfaction. Of course, in that event notice will be given to the applicant for grant of patent who can file his reply and evidence. This Court finds merit in the contention that the pre-grant opposition is in fact in aid of the examination of the patent application by the Controller. The procedure is however different aspect as far as the post-grant opposition is concerned. There in terms of Section 25(3), the Controller has to constitute an Opposition  Board consisting of such officers as he may determine and refer to such Opposition Board the notice of opposition along with other documents for its examination and recommendations. After receiving the recommendations of the Opposition Board, the Controller gives the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard. The Controller then takes a decision to maintain, amend or revoke the patent. The fourth major difference between the pre-grant and the post-grant opposition is that while in terms of Section 117A an appeal to the IPAB is maintainable against the order of the Controller in a post-grant opposition under Section 25(4) of the Patents Act, an appeal has not been expressly been made available against an order made under Section 25(1) of the Patents Act.”",

Yogesh Mehra, (2014) 15 SCC 360, the Supreme Court considered in detail the procedures relating to post-grant oppositions and the overlapping nature of jurisdiction of the IPAB and the High Courts. It held:  “..17. When a challenge is raised at the pre-grant stage, under Section 25(1) of the Patents Act, the same is liable to be determined at the hands of the “Controller”. An order passed by the “Controller” can be assailed by way of an appeal before the “Appellate Board”. When a challenge is raised under Section 25(2), it must be raised within one year of the publication of the grant (of patent). The same has to be examined, in the first instance, by an “Opposition Board” contemplated under Section 25(3). The recommendations made by the “Opposition Board” are then to be placed before the “Controller” for consideration. After issuing notice to the patent-holder, and after affording an opportunity of hearing to the patent-holder, the “Controller” is required to pass the final order, on a notice of opposition filed under Section 25(2). Such order passed by the “Controller”  is assailable by way of an appeal, before the “Appellate Board”. A challenge raised by “any person interested”, under Section 64(1), is liable to be adjudicated, at the very first instance, by the “Appellate Board”. If in response to an “infringement suit”, the defendant files a “counterclaim” seeking the revocation of the patent concerned, the said process of adjudication would lie before the jurisdictional High Court [see the proviso to Sections 64(1) and 104 of the Patents Act].”",

The procedure to be followed by the Controller is provided in Rule 62 of the Rules, which reads as follows:  “62.Hearing.—(1) On the completion of the presentation of evidence, if any, and on receiving the recommendation of Opposition Board or at such other time as the Controller may think fit, he shall fix a date and time for the hearing of the opposition and shall give the parties not less than ten days' notice of such hearing and may require members of Opposition Board to be present in the hearing.  (2)  If either party to the proceeding desires to be heard, he shall inform the Controller by a notice along with the fee as specified in the First Schedule.  (3)  The Controller may refuse to hear any party who has not given notice under sub-rule (2).  (4)  If either party intends to rely on any publication at the hearing not already mentioned in the notice, statement or evidence, he shall give to the other party and to the Controller not less than five days' notice of his intention, together with details of such publication.  (5)  After hearing the party or parties desirous of being heard, or if neither party desires to be heard, then without a hearing, and after taking into consideration  the recommendation of Opposition Board, the Controller shall decide the opposition and notify his decision to the parties giving reasons therefor.” Sub-rule (1) of Rule 62 confers power on the Controller to require members of Opposition Board to be present in the hearing after receiving recommendation of the Opposition Board. The Controller, after hearing the parties if they so desire and after taking into consideration the recommendation of the Opposition Board, has to decide the opposition giving reasons.",

Controller General of Patents, Design, Trademark and Geographical Indications 2013 SCC OnLine IPAB 76  i)  The Opponent has to file the written statement of opposition (`Opposition‟) along with his evidence;  ii) The Patentee, if it wishes to contest the opposition has to file the reply statement (`Patentee‟s Reply‟) along with its evidence within a period of two months after receiving the opponent‟s opposition. If the patentee does not contest or file a reply/evidence, the patent would be deemed to be revoked;  iii)  Upon the Patentee filing its reply statement, the opponent has the opportunity to file the reply evidence (hereinafter „Opponent‟s Rejoinder‟) within one month upon receiving the patentee‟s reply. However, the said rejoinder would have to be strictly confined to the matters which have been raised in the patentee‟s evidence. Thus, there is no permissibility for the opponent to expand the scope of the rejoinder beyond the reply filed by the Patentee;  iv)  The Opposition Board constituted under Rule 56 would then consider all the documents filed by the parties and submit a report along with its joint recommendation to the Controller.  Thus, the scheme of the Rules envisages that the Opposition Board ought to consider all the pleadings and documents prior to giving its recommendations. Further, the timelines which have been stipulated in the Rules also show that the same ought to be followed strictly. From the time when the patent is granted, therefore, the expectation would be that if a post-grant opposition is filed, the same would be decided in an expeditious manner.",

The use of the word ‘publication’ in Rule 62(4) is extremely significant. It relates only to a publicly available document and not to any private document such as a lab report, an expert affidavit or any other internal document. A publication would be a document which would have otherwise being publicly available for either of the parties to verify the same. The logic behind use of the word publication in Rule 62(4) is obvious. Whenever patents are filed, there is a clear expectation that patentees would be aware of any publications relating to the said field of technology. Thus, all publications are deemed to be in the knowledge of the patentee. If either the Opponent or Patentee wishes to rely on any  publications five days before the hearing, the same is permitted inasmuch as parties are expected to have had knowledge of such publications and hence there would be no surprise to a party. The reason why reliance on such a publication is permitted is to ensure that no patent is wrongly granted or wrongly opposed. Considering that the scheme of the Rules has specific timelines for all the steps that are to be undertaken in a post-grant opposition, it is understood that such reliance on publication would be permissible not in usual but in exceptional cases where a publication was not placed inadvertently or was not within the party‟s knowledge. In any event, when such a publication is cited, since it has been cited just five days prior to the hearing, the exact portion which is relied upon ought to be highlighted to the other party. The word „details’ in Rule 62(4) would thus mean that the date and name of publication, exact portion of the publication relied upon ought to be pointed out to the opposite party who can, at short notice be able to controvert the same at the hearing.",

Pushap Sudan, (supra) five Judges Bench of Supreme Court declared the access to justice to be valuable right which includes effective adjudicatory mechanism. Relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder:- “29.To sum up: access to justice is and has been recognised as a part and parcel of right to life in India and in all civilised societies around the globe. The right is so basic and inalienable that no system of governance can possibly ignore its significance, leave alone afford to deny the same to its citizens. The Magna Carta, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, the ancient Roman jurisprudential maxim ubi jus ibi remedium, the development of fundamental principles of common law by judicial pronouncements of the courts over centuries past have all contributed to the acceptance of access to  justice as a basic and inalienable human right which all civilised societies and systems recognise and enforce.  xxx  xxx xxx 31. Given the fact that pronouncements mentioned above have interpreted and understood the word “life” appearing in Article 21 of the Constitution on a broad spectrum of rights considered incidental and/or integral to the right to life, there is no real reason why access to justice should be considered to be falling outside the class and category of the said rights, which already stands recognised as being a part and parcel of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. If “life” implies not only life in the physical sense but a bundle of rights that makes life worth living, there is no juristic or other basis for holding that denial of “access to justice” will not affect the quality of human life so as to take access to justice out of the purview of right to life guaranteed under Article 21. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that access to justice is indeed a facet of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. We need only add that access to justice may as well be the facet of the right guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before law and equal protection of laws to not only citizens but non-citizens also. We say so because equality before law and equal protection of laws is not limited in its application to the realm of executive action that enforces the law. It is as much available in relation to proceedings before courts and tribunal and adjudicatory fora where law is applied and justice administered. The citizen's inability to access courts or any other adjudicatory mechanism provided for determination of rights and obligations is bound to result in denial of the guarantee contained in Article 14 both in relation to equality before law as well as equal protection of laws. Absence of any adjudicatory mechanism or the inadequacy of such mechanism, needless to say, is bound to prevent those looking for enforcement of their right to equality before laws and equal protection of the laws from seeking redress and thereby negate the guarantee of equality before laws or equal protection of laws and reduce it to a mere teasing illusion. Article 21 of the Constitution apart, access to justice can be said to be part of the guarantee contained in Article 14 as well.",

In order that the right of a citizen to access justice is protected, the mechanism so provided must not only be effective but must also be just, fair and objective in its approach.

If the process of administration of justice is so time-consuming, laborious, indolent and frustrating for those who seek justice that it dissuades or deters them from even considering resort to that process as an option, it would tantamount to denial of not only access to justice but justice itself. In Sheela Barse case [Sheela Barse v. Union of India, (1988) 4 SCC 226] this Court declared speedy trial as a facet of right to life, for if the trial of a citizen goes on endlessly his right to life itself is violated. There is jurisprudentially no  qualitative difference between denial of speedy trial in a criminal case, on the one hand, and civil suit, appeal or other proceedings, on the other, for ought we to know that civil disputes can at times have an equally, if not more, severe impact on a citizen's life or the quality of it. Access to justice would, therefore, be a constitutional value of any significance and utility only if the delivery of justice to the citizen is speedy, for otherwise, the right to access to justice is no more than a hollow slogan of no use or inspiration for the citizen.”  (Emphasis Supplied)",

Dr.Subramaniam Swamy, 1996 4 SCC 104, one of the members of the Commission was under disability to hear the matter on account of the allegations of bias. The Supreme Court invoked the Doctrine of Necessity and observed that if the choice is between allowing biased person to act or to stifle the action altogether, the choice must fall in favour of the former as it is the only way to promote decision-making. The Supreme Court held that if the two Election Commissioners are able to reach a unanimous decision, there is no need for the Chief Election Commissioner to participate but if the two Election Commissioners are unable to reach a unanimous decision then the doctrine of necessity may have to be he invoked and Chief Election Commissioner would be compelled to express his views so that the majority opinion can be formed, notwithstanding the allegations of biasness. The relevant portion of the said judgment is as under:- \"16. We must have a clear conception of the doctrine. It is well settled that the law permits certain things to be done as a matter of necessity which it would otherwise not countenance on the touchstone of judicial propriety. Stated differently, the doctrine of necessity makes it imperative for the authority to decide and considerations of judicial propriety must yield. It is often invoked in cases of bias where there is no other authority or Judge to decide the issue. If the doctrine of  necessity is not allowed full play in certain unavoidable situations, it would impede the course of justice itself and the defaulting party would benefit therefrom. Take the case of a certain taxing statute which taxes certain perquisites allowed to Judges. If the validity of such a provision is challenged who but the members of the judiciary must decide it. If all the Judges are disqualified on the plea that striking down of such a legislation would benefit them, a stalemate situation may develop. In such cases the doctrine of necessity comes into play. If the choice is between allowing a biased person to act or to stifle the action altogether, the choice must fall in favour of the former as it is the only way to promote decision-making. In the present case also if the two Election Commissioners are able to reach a unanimous decision, there is no need for the Chief Election Commissioner to participate, if not the doctrine of necessity may have to be invoked.",

An objection was immediately raised by the Assessee therein to the expansion of the Coram of the Appellate Tribunal to include the Member (Technical) who had till then been away on account of leave or absence and had not participated in the hearing. With the Appellate Tribunal negativing the objection, the Assessee filed a writ petition in this Court questioning the correctness of the said order of the Appellate Tribunal. This Court took note of the fact that under Regulation 35(3) of the Appellate Tribunal Regulations, there can be a situation where the full Coram of the Appellate Tribunal is not available since one or more members could withdraw on the ground of conflict of interest vis-a-vis the subject matter of the proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder:- “8. The Petitioner's grievance is simple enough; it contends that once the Tribunal -which at the relevant time consisted of two functioning members, the third having gone on leave-heard its appeals, substantially and the arguments of the revenue were scheduled, it was not open, midstream, as it were, for a change in composition of that body. Its argument is of prejudice, since the third member joining the proceeding, does not have the benefit of hearing its submissions. The revenue's argument is that the Tribunal is a composite body of three members; whatever its compulsions in hearing the appeals during the absence of one member, the moment she returned, there is no irregularity in all the three members participating in the hearing, so long as the hearing has not concluded. It also argues that there is no power with the Chairman of the Tribunal to constitute benches, or hear appeals in composition of less than the full membership of that body.”  The Court further proceeded to observe that the conspectus of the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 and the Appellate Tribunal Regulations reveal  that an Appellate Tribunal discharges judicial functions. Even if there were anomalies in the provisions, anything which tends to undermine the public confidence in the Appellate Tribunal has to be “shunned and wherever necessary, cured”. In the facts and circumstances, the Court passed an order forbearing the third Member (Technical) from participating in the proceedings in the appeal in question any further and also directed the appeal to be disposed of by the Appellate Tribunal comprising two members who heard it at the first place. This decision underscores that the legislative intent was that of continuity of the Appellate Tribunal and not its cessation because of a vacancy in its membership. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereunder:-",

                        "content": "Facially, the provisions of the Act and Regulations suggest that the Tribunal, whenever it consists of a plurality of members has to hold sittings en-banc. However, at the same time, (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1546946/>)Sections 73 (4) contemplates a situation where a vacancy might arise in the membership of the Tribunal. This is not perceived to be an impediment in its functioning or cause such a hiatus as to require a separate provision, to enable the existing members to continue with their functioning. Nor does the statute ordain a minimum quorum for the hearing of appeals. It, therefore, appears that the statute is neutral about the consequences which follow in the event of a member's absence from the Tribunal for a temporary period, as in this case. This aspect is important, because the absence of any prohibition either in the negative form, enjoining members from functioning and hearing appeals during the absence of one of them, or absence of a provision mandating a minimum quorum, implies that the Legislature did not contemplate a logjam, in the Tribunal's functioning. The argument of the revenue about a restrictive class of cases which deals with absence of a member, i.e. in terms of Regulation 35, is insubstantial. For one, that Regulation is not part of the statute; secondly, it states an obvious rule, which all members of judicial and quasi judicial bodies have to follow. Its absence would in no whit undermine the principle it gives shape to. It would be useful to recollect that every Tribunal is clothed with incidental and ancillary powers to  effectuate its orders, and W.P.(C) 5621/2012 carry out its functions effectively (Ref. Union of India v Paras Laminates (P) Ltd AIR 1991 SC 696). Thus, a temporary absence of one of the members of the VAT Tribunal can, by no stretch of the imagination, result in its becoming dysfunctional, or being unable to function.  xxx  xxx xxx",

Unauthorized adoption and use of a deceptively similar mark ZIFFI and domain name by the defendants in relation to their services and business is without permission, dishonest, illegal, unfair, unjustified, without due cause and in bad faith. Such unauthorized use of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark by the defendant, even if for dissimilar goods/services is undoubtedly to take unfair advantage of the reputation of the plaintiff’s registered trade marks and is detrimental to its distinctive character. The malafide intentions of the defendants can also be seen from the very fact that they have directed their earlier website to the impugned domain . There is no bona fide reason or explanation given by the defendants for adoption of the trade mark and domain name ZIFFI and , which are visually, phonetically and deceptively similar and/or identical to the plaintiff’s ZIFI and ZIFI FAMILY of registered trade marks and domain name respectively. The defendants have adopted the mark ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM to trade upon the immense goodwill and transnational reputation enjoyed by the plaintiff.

Such unsolicited use of the trade mark ZIFFI and domain name by the defendants takes unfair advantage of and is detrimental to the distinctive character, goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark ZIFI and ZIFI FAMILY OF TRADE MARKS, as well as its domain name . The pharmaceutical goods manufactured by the plaintiff under the trade mark ZIFI and its variations, for purchase and use by patients, and the online services offered by the defendants under the name ZIFFI through its website , which allows users to book appointments with doctors, diagnostic centres, salons and other healthcare services, are in respect of similar target customer base/clientele. Hence, in these circumstances, confusion and deception is bound to take place, which is diluting the uniqueness and distinctiveness of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark ZIFI as well as domain name . The defendants have no legitimate rights or interest to use the impugned trade mark and domain name ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM or any other trade mark visually, phonetically, structurally, confusingly and deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s registered trade mark, therefore, will not suffer any loss, if they are restrained from using the trade mark impugned trade mark ZIFFI/ZIFFI.COM in relation to their services and business”.",

The defendants claim to have adopted “Ziffi” from the term \"Jiffy\"-to signify their “quick” and “speedy” service, but they could have, very well, chosen another name connoting the same meaning or essence. Ms. Majumder also submits that retaining of the letter \"i\" also casts a shadow of doubt on the defendants as their alleged mark reads as \"Ziffi\" with an \"i\"  instead of \"Ziffy\" with a \"y\".

It is submitted that the promotional activities of the plaintiff extends to doctors’, physicians’ and diagnostic clinics by way of posters, labels, stationary etc., and the defendants are also engaged in the booking of doctors’ appointments and diagnostic clinics etc. Thus, as per the plaintiff, business of the plaintiff and the defendants are allied, cognate and related. Reliance is placed on the discussion on related goods in McCarthy on “Trademarks and Unfair Competition”. The learned author states as follows:  “Goods and Services Can be “Related” Without Being Competitive. To be “related” in the parlance of trademark law, the conflicting good or services do not have to be in competition with each others. That the goods or services are noncompetitive does not answer the question of whether the goods are so “related” that a reasonable buyer is likely to think that defendant’s goods or services are somehow connected with, or sponsored by, the plaintiff, due to similar marks. There is no simple, one-question test for determining whether noncompetitive products are “related” such that confusion is likely as to source, affiliation, connection or sponsorship.  What Does “Related” Mean? Goods are “related”, not because of any inherent common quality of the respective goods, but “related” in the sense that buyers are likely to  believe that such goods, similarly marked, come from the same source, or are somehow connected with or sponsored by a common company. As the Federal Circuit observed, “related” means related in the minds of potential buyers:  [G]oods that are neither used together nor related to one another in kind may still “be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods. It is this sense of relatedness that matters in the likelihood of confusion analysis.”  “Related” does not mean that there is necessarily any physical relationship between the goods or services identified by the conflicting marks. Rather, it means that the marks as used are “related” in the mind of the consuming public. Goods are “related” if customers are likely to mistakenly think that the infringer’s goods come from the same source as the senior user’s goods or are sponsored by, affiliated with or connected with the senior user. As the Ninth Circuit stated: “The [defendant’s] use need not be the same as, nor one in competition with the original use. The question is, are the uses so related that they are likely to be connected in the mind of a prospective purchaser?.........” [Emphasis supplied]",

Learned counsel for the plaintiff relies upon McCarthy on ‘Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Vol. 4 to submit that the defendant is guilty of ‘initial interest confusion’.  The learned author in the said work states as follows:  “Initial Interest Confusion Defined. Infringement can be based upon confusion that creates initial customer interest, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a result of confusion. Most courts now  recognize the initial interest confusion theory as a form of likelihood of confusion.  .  .  .      Initial Interest Confusion on the Internet: Domain Names. Courts have applied the initial interest test of infringement to domain names that conflict with a prior trademark. Some courts held that a disclaimer on an otherwise infringing Web site does not remedy the initial interest confusion which is caused by a confusingly similar domain name. If the web user is using the trademark because she is looking for the site of the company that owns the mark, initial interest confusion caused by the domain name may deceive and lure the web user to the defendant’s Web site. Even though when the user accesses the defendant’s site, she finds that it is not the plaintiff’s site, the defendant has succeeded in luring users to his site, which often is the defendant’s main purpose.  .  .  .      An Analogy. The analogy to trademark initial interest confusion is a job-seeker who misrepresents educational background on a resume, obtains an interview and at the interview explains that the inflated resume claim is a mistake or a “typo”. The misrepresentation has enabled the job-seeker to obtain a coveted interview, a clear advantage over others with the same background who honestly stated their educational achievements on their resume. In such a situation, it is not possible to say that the misrepresentation caused no competitive damage.” [Emphasis supplied]  She also relies upon the following cases in this regard:  (i)  Brookfield Communications Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corporation 174 F.3d 1036;  (ii)  Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corporation 354 F.3d 1020.",

They have made conscious effort to promote the change of its trade name from 'DocSuggest' to 'Ziffi'. The word was spread by publishing a blogpost titled “DocSuggest is transforming in a Ziffi” on their website, by making a declaration-reading “Your favorite Docsuggest is now Ziffi!” which appears on top of every page on the defendants’ website. All communications with salons, spas, doctors, diagnostic centres, and other wellness related service providers are done in the name of DocSuggest  Healthcare Private Limited. Further, all forms and applications for registration of the services provided by the defendant has “DocSuggest Healthcare Private Limited” printed on top.

Allied/cognate goods or services, as understood from the material referred to below, are those goods/services which are not identical, but can be said to be related or similar in nature (See McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Fourth Edition, Vol 5). The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles Fifth Edition 2002, Vol. 1. defines the term “Allied” as “connected by nature or qualities; having affinity” and the term “Cognate” as “akin in origin, nature or quality”. Reference may also be made to New Webster’s Dictionary and Thesaurus of the English Language, 1992 which defines “Allied” as “relating in subject or kind” and “Cognate” as “1. adj. having a common ancestor or origin|| (of languages or words) having a common source or root|| (of subjects etc.) related, naturally grouped together.”. Cognate goods/ services can be described, inter alia, as goods or services which have a trade connection – as in glucose and biscuits (See Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., AIR 1960 SC 142) or which are intended for the same class of customers – as in television picture tubes (parts thereof, video tapes and cassettes and television tuners etc.) and televisions, tuners and T.V.

                        "content": "On the application of aforesaid principles, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s goods are similar to and associated with the defendants’ services. The reasons for the same are:  (i)  Respective uses of goods/services: Plaintiff’s products are a wide range of medicines used to treat several diseases including typhoid, bronchitis, fever & infection, etc. Defendants’  services, inter alia, includes the fixing of appointment of doctors/diagnostics for medical check-ups to be treated for several diseases, including the ones treated by plaintiff’s medicinal range, with the mark in question;  (ii)  Intended Purpose: Plaintiff’s products intend to achieve the cure/ prevention of several diseases. Defendants’ services are meant for booking of appointment of, inter alia, doctors/diagnostic for curing and possibly further prevention of several diseases, including the ones treated by the plaintiff’s medicines under the mark in question;  (iii)  Respective Users of goods/services: Users of plaintiff’s products are patients. Users of defendants’ services are also, inter alia, patients. They are health care seekers. The target customer base and clientele of the two marks is likely to have an overlap, especially amongst doctors, and consumers/patients availing services of doctors, diagnostic clinics and healthcare services. A consumer of the plaintiffs products (though they are prescription drugs) may visit the defendants' website and is likely to get confused and mislead into thinking that the services offered by the defendants are coming from the same source as the goods/medicines of the plaintiff.;  (iv)  Physical Nature of goods/services: Plaintiff’s products are medicines which are prescribed by doctors. Defendants’ services are online booking services for obtaining  appointments, inter alia, with doctors/diagnostic centres, which requires the user of the services to visit the clinic/hospital to get him/her treated and get prescribed medicines by the doctor, if required;  (v)  Sector: Both the goods viz. medicines with the mark in question, and services of the defendants under the impugned mark pertain to the healthcare and medicinal sector;  (vi)  Trade Channels: The plaintiff’s products are medicines which are available at dispensaries; at the chemists, or; at the doctor’s clinic. Defendants’ services are to provide online appointment of doctors, who may prescribe the user of such service with any of the plaintiff’s product. Moreover, since both fall under the same sector of healthcare, it is difficult to negate that there cannot be any overlap in the two.  It is also a fact – of which the Court can take notice that organizations who have established themselves in a particular field have the tendency to diversify into related fields. Thus, an unwary customer of the plaintiff is likely to draw an association with the service offered by the defendant – also in the healthcare sector, which included fixing of Doctors appointments;  (vii)  Reputation: The sales figures; promotional expenses; the advancement of the Zifi products for adult and pediatric range of medicines; trademark registrations; the spread of the Zifi products and Zifi family of trademarks in India, and to  countries outside India, as well as the international and national accreditations and awards received by the plaintiff, prima facie, establish that the plaintiff has built a strong reputation with its distinctive mark “Zifi” within the medicinal and pharmaceutical sector in the past 17 years in India. The mark, by virtue of its prolonged use and arbitrary adoption, has maintained an inherently distinctive character, such that a user is likely to get confused if he were to see the identical/ similar mark being used for related services in the healthcare space, like that of the defendants.  It is, thus, apparent that there is similarity and association between the plaintiff’s products and the defendants’ services.",

Pertinently, this provision was introduced for the first time in the Act of 1999, which replaced the erstwhile Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958. The earlier Act only provided for one instance of infringement, which today, forms part of clause (1) of Section 29. Prior to the Act of 1999, in cases of similarity in goods and services, an action of passing off would lie. Such a right had been recognized as early as in the 1930s in Thomas Bear and Sons (India) v. Prayag Narain AIR1935 All 7. On a difference of opinion between two learned judges, the learned Single Judge observed as follows:-\"The rule deducible from the foregoing cases appears to be that the plaintiffs, whose goods have acquired a reputation in the market through a trade mark or name with which their goods have become associated, have a right to restrain the defendant from using, a trade mark or name which is identical with or similar to that of the plaintiffs, and such right extends not only to the particular goods sold by the plaintiffs, but also to cognate classes of goods, provided the cumulative effect of the similarity of the mark, of the commercial connection between the plaintiffs’ goods and those of the defendant, and surrounding circumstances is such as to lead the unwary customers to mistake the defendant's goods for those of the plaintiffs.\" (emphasis supplied)",

The Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v.

When read and pronounced, the two marks are nearly identical. The use of the second letter ‘f’ merely emphasizes the use of the sound that the said letter produces, when pronounced/spoken.

A consumer who comes across the plaintiffs mark at one point of time, and with the defendants mark at another point of time, is not likely to remember the minor and insignificant difference in the two marks, and it is highly likely that he may recall the mark he may have come across earlier, and associate the services of the defendant as coming from the organization of the plaintiff, or vice versa.",

It is for the Court to decide that question.\". Kerly's (15th ed.) states in Para 9-047 that \"The likelihood of confusion is to be assessed globally, taking into account all factors relevant to the marks and goods and services in issue, and this will include any reputation attaching to the earlier trade mark.\" The general principles as stated by Kerly’s in assessing the likelihood of confusion include a global assessment; the relevant public; degree of similarity between the marks; overall impression of the marks; distinctive character of the earlier mark; imperfect recollection; similarity of goods and services. I am of the view that there exists a likelihood of confusion or deception of the public on the defendants’ using the mark ‘Ziffi’. The marks ‘Ziffi’ and ‘Zifi’ are phonetically identical. As discussed, the difference of an extra letter ‘f’ is so minuscule, that an average consumer with imperfect recollection is unlikely to remember the same and, prima facie, would likely get deceived, and confuse one in place of the other. Only a person with an extraordinary or photographic memory would possibly pay attention to such detail, but as held in a catena of judgments, the test to be applied is of a consumer with an average and imperfect memory and recollection.",

The plaintiffs were manufacturing electrical goods and appliances under Class 11 of the Schedule to the Act, whereas the defendants were manufacturing utensils under Class 21 of the Schedule to the Act. The court held in Para 8 that: “The articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are kitchen wares and are commonly used in almost every kitchen in this country. The mere fact that the articles manufactured by the contesting parties are different in nature is no answer to the claim that the defendants are guilty of passing off. We entirely agree with the conclusion recorded by the learned trial Judge that there is identity of the goods, the mark and the consumer and the goods manufactured by both the plaintiffs and the defendants are sold under one shop. Mr. Cooper complained that the electric goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the stainless steels utensils manufactured by the defendants are not sold in one shop. The submission is not accurate because it is common experience that kitchen ware or kitchen appliances like mixers, grinders, pressure cookers, and stainless steel utensils are sold in the same shop. At this interim stage, we are not prepared to accept the submission of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no reason to take different view from that of the learned single  Judge on this aspect. In our judgment, prima facie, it is clear that the defendants have intentionally and dishonestly tried to pass off their goods by use of name “Bajaj”.\" The court upheld the grant of injunction on account of a similar consumer base.",

Section 29(4) is also distinct from Section 29(1) to (3) of the TM Act in another important aspect. The element of having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion is absent. Perhaps to balance out this element, the legislature has mandated the necessity of showing that (a) the mark has a reputation in India (b) that the mark has a distinctive character (c) the use by the infringer is without due cause. In other words, the legislative intent is to afford a stronger protection to a mark that has a reputation without the registered proprietor of such mark having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion arising from the use of a similar mark in relation to dissimilar goods and services. The words 'unfair advantage' and 'detriment' in the context of the 'distinctive character' and 'reputation' of the mark bring in the concept of 'dilution'. In the context of 'repute' they are also relateable to the concept of 'tarnishment'. The disjunctive 'or' between the words 'distinctive character' and 'repute' is designedly inserted to cater to a situation where a mark may not have a distinctive character and yet may have a reputation. It may not always be necessary for the proprietor of a registered mark to show that it is a 'well-known trademark' as defined in Section although if in fact it is, it makes it easier to satisfy the 'reputation' requirement of Section 29(4) of the TM Act. The presumption of distinctiveness attached to a registered mark is a rebuttable one. At the interim stage, either of these elements showed be shown prima facie to exist.

At first an attempt was made to explain merely the word ‘Sima’ and then when it was realized that an explanation was also necessary for the last four letters which contained identical name ‘Atul’ used by the plaintiff-Company a fresh explanation was invented we are not prepared to accept this facile explanation too readily.

No document apart from a bare assertion that the five named individuals had any special collective role in the organization or promotion of the business has been filed. The appellant’s internet based business was, from 1999, high profile. The evident media prominence to ‘SIFY’ and large subscriber base could have left the respondent in no doubt as to its successful existence prior to the adoption of Siffy as part of its corporate name and registration of Siffynet and Siffy.com as its domain names. It would therefore appear that the justification followed the choice and that the respondent’s choice of the word “Siffy” was not original but inspired by the appellant’s business name and that the respondent’s explanation for its choice of the word “Siffy” as a corporate and domain name is an invented post-rationalisation.”  Similarly, in the present case, adoption of the word 'ZIFFI' as a derivative of the word 'Jiffy' by the defendants to signify the quick and speedy nature of their service appears to be devised. There is no justification for change in spelling from \"Jiffy\" to \"ZIFFI\". It is also pertinent to mention that the  plaintiff's adoption of the term 'ZIFI' was much prior to that of the defendants, and a change in the services/goods will not make a difference in establishing honest adoption of the mark by the defendant.",

                        "content": "I shall now deal with defendants' submission premised on Section 34 of the Act. Section 34 serves as an exception to Section 29, if the offending mark is in continuous use prior to the first use of the registered trademark or from its date of registration. The section reads as under:  “34. Saving for vested rights.—  Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere with or restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods or services in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date prior—  (a)  to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods or services be the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or  (b)  to the date of registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods or services in the name of the proprietor of a predecessor in title of his;  whichever is the earlier, and the Registrar shall not refuse (on such use being proved), to register the second mentioned trade mark by reason only of the registration of the first mentioned trade mark.”  (emphasis supplied)  The defendants allege that they are prior users of the mark ‘ZIFFI’ for booking of appointments of doctors, diagnostics, spas etc and that Section 34 has to be interpreted in relation to the goods or services of the defendants. If it were so, it would permit a person to dishonestly adopt a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to a prior registered trademark (well known or not) but being used for goods or services which are different to that of the prior trademark. Such an interpretation would be in the teeth of Section 29 of the Act. Priority has to be viewed in relation to the use of the mark, and not the goods or services for which the mark is used. I, therefore, find no merit in the defendants’ interpretation of Section 34 of the Act.",

                        "content": "To address the submission of the defendants on delay in filing of the suit by the plaintiff after the expiry of the caveats filed by the defendants, I refer to the decision in the following cases:  M/s Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s India Stationary Products Co. and another AIR 1990 DELHI 19: The learned Single Judge in para 39 ruled that “Any growth after notice is at the risk and peril of the defendant. The defendant certainly had notice of application of the plaintiff having been filed against it in the year 1985 for cancellation of registration of the  copyright. The defendant should have been warned, at that stage, that the plaintiff is not likely to accept the user of its mark by the defendant. If the defendant continued to do business by using the impugned mark, it did so at its own peril. The continued user cannot be set up as a defence under these circumstances.”  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. v. Reddy Pharmaceuticals Limited: the Court held that “…the owners of trade marks or copyrights are not expected to run after every infringer and thereby remain involved in litigation at the cost of their business time. If the impugned infringement is too trivial or insignificant and is not capable of harming their business interests, they may overlook and ignore petty violations till they assume alarming proportions.”  Thus, the defendants were already aware of plaintiff's business when they received a cease and desist notice from it in October, 2014. Filing of an infringement suit after six months by the plaintiff does not amount to any significant delay, and cannot be said to be an approach to the court with unclean hands since the defendants were already put on notice of plaintiff's grievance.",

Our reasons for holding so are as under:  (A)  Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) requires the suit to be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try.  (B)  The Court of lowest grade competent to try the suit, the valuation whereof for the purposes of jurisdiction as per the plaint was in excess of Rs.20 lakhs, till coming into force of the Amendment Act on 26th October, 2015, was the High Court of Delhi.  (C)  It is the settled principle of law that certain rights accrue on the date of institution of a legal proceeding and which cannot be prejudicially affected subsequently. Supreme Court recently in Manager, VKNM Vocational Higher Secondary School Vs. State of Kerala (2016) 4 SCC 216 summarised the principle by observing that  ―for the legal pursuit of a remedy it must be shown that the various stages of such remedy are formed into a chain or rather as series of it, which are connected by an intrinsic unity which can be called as one proceeding, that such vested right, if any, should have its origin in a proceeding which was instituted on such right having been crystallized at the time of its origin itself, in which event all future claims on that basis to be pursued would get preserved till the said right is to be ultimately examined. In the event of such preservation of the future remedy having come into existence and got crystallized, that would date back to the date of origin when the so-called vested right commenced, that then and then only it can be held that the said right became a vested right and it is not defeated by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of subsequent filing of the claim. One other fundamental principle laid down which is to be borne in mind is that even such a vested right can also be taken away by a subsequent enactment if such subsequent enactment specifically provides by express words or by necessary intendment. In other words, in the event  of the extinction of any such right by express provision in the subsequent enactment, the same would lose its value.‖ Notice may also be taken of Rajesh D. Darbar Vs. Narasingrao Krishnaji Kulkarni (2003) 7 SCC 219 where it was held ―subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation….but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage….Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs -cannot deny rights -to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice….Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of the litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side. All these are done only in exceptional situations and just cannot be done if the statute, on which the legal proceeding is based, inhibits, by its scheme or otherwise, such change in the cause of action or relief. The primary concern of the Court is to implement the justice of the legislation…..There can be no quarrel with the proposition….that a party cannot be made to suffer on account of an act of the Court.‖  (D)  A distinction in this regard has also been made between a procedural right and a substantive right. A right of appeal has been held to be a substantive right which accrues on the date of institution of legal proceedings. It is settled principle of law that a party to a suit who is dissatisfied with a judgment passed in civil proceedings has a right of appeal which had accrued to him on the date of institution of the suit or proceeding in the Court of first instance, according to the law then in force and it is immaterial whether the judgment is passed before or after the change in law. The right to go from Court to Court in appeal is the right which vests at the date of institution of the proceedings in the Court of the first instance. As far back as in Mohd. Idris Vs. Sat Narain AIR 1966 SC 1499 a bench of five Judges, finding the application under Section 12 of the U.P. Agriculturist Relief Act for redemption of a mortgage to have been filed before the Munsif, Allahabad to have been filed before the repeal thereof by amendment to the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 and further finding that the repealing provision did not state whether the repeal was to be operative retrospectively or not and relying on Section 6 of the U.P. General Clauses Act held that the repealing provision did not take away the right with respect to a pending action and the proceeding before the Munsif to be maintainable notwithstanding the repeal.  (E)  Seen in this light, the Amendment Act appeared to us to be prospective in its nature and not retrospective and thus not affecting the suits instituted prior to the coming into force thereof. It appeared  that the suits, valuation whereof for the purposes of jurisdiction was in excess of Rs.20 lakhs and which as per the law in force at the time of institution were filed in this Court, even after coming into force of the Amendment Act were to continue and would have continued in this Court, inspite of their valuation being less than Rs.2 crores but for Section 4 thereof which empowered Hon‘ble the Chief Justice to transfer any suit or other proceeding pending in this Court immediately before the commencement of the Amendment Act to such subordinate Courts as would have jurisdiction to entertain such suit had the same been instituted post coming into force of the Amendment Act.  (F)  Thus seen, it appeared that this Court, at the time of institution of this suit as well as after the coming into force of the Amendment Act, continued to have jurisdiction to try the suit; that it was not as if this Court by way of the Amendment Act lost its pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suits instituted prior to coming into force of the Amendment Act and the valuation whereof for the purposes of jurisdiction though more than Rs.20 lakhs, was less than Rs.2 crores. Transfer of the pending suits is in terms of the notification dated 24th November, 2015 read with the power conferred on the Chief Justice under Section 4 of the Amending Act.  (G)  However we find that earlier, when the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court was raised from over Rs.1,00,000/-to over Rs.5,00,000/-vide Delhi High Court Amendment Act, 1991 containing identical language, a Division  Bench of this Court, in Delhi High Court Bar Association Vs. Hon’ble Chief Justice, High Court of Delhi (1993) 50 DLT 532, dealing with a challenge to Section 4 of the then Amendment Act similarly authorising the Chief Justice with respect to pending suits and the Office Order of the Chief Justice transferring certain category of pending suits, to have held i) that but for Section 4 of the Amendment Act, all suits of the value of Rs.5 lakhs and below would have stood transferred to the District Court from the date of enforcement of Amendment Act and this court would cease to have jurisdiction to try any of such suits – this is clear from the language of Section 5(2) of the High Court Act as after the amendment thereof High Court would have ordinary original jurisdiction in civil suits of the value exceeding 5 lakhs; ii) this ordinary original jurisdiction had been conferred on the High Court by the High Court Act and that jurisdiction, by the Amendment Act, had been limited to the cases of value exceeding Rs.5 lakhs; iii) Section 4 prevents this result flowing from the amendment of Section 5(2) and allows retaining of suits of the value of below Rs.5 lakhs pending in this Court; iv) this is clear from last line of Section 4 of Amendment Act which provides that when cases are so transferred to subordinate Court, those courts shall entertain those suits as if they had been instituted for the first time before them after the commencement of the Amendment Act; v) then, an appeal from a decree or order of subordinate court shall lie to a forum as provided in Section 39 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1918; vi) a change of forum is a change of procedural law and not a substantive law; vii) though a right of  appeal is a substantive right which vests on date of institution of lis but the forum where such appeal could be lodged was a procedural matter.  (H) . We may in this respect also notice that Supreme Court recently in Ramesh Kumar Soni Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (2013) 14 SCC 696 also held that any amendment shifting the forum of trial, on principle is retrospective in nature in the absence of any indication in Amendment Act to the contrary and that no vested right of forum of trial could be claimed. It was further held that amendments relating to procedure operate retrospectively subject to the exception that whatever be the procedure which was correctly adopted and proceedings concluded under old law, the same cannot be re-opened for the purpose of applying new procedure.  (I) . Without going into the correctness of the view taken by the Division Bench of this Court in judgment supra on interpretation of Section 5(2), of this Court ceasing to have jurisdiction with respect to pending proceedings and Section 4 saving the same, even as per the said view this Court did not cease to have jurisdiction with respect to pending suits on coming into force of Amendment Act, till the Chief Justice took the decision.  (J)  Notice may next be taken of the difference between minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of a Court and maximum pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court. While a Court is said to be not having jurisdiction to try a suit above its maximum pecuniary jurisdiction,  the converse is not true. A Court cannot be said to be not having jurisdiction over suits below its minimum pecuniary jurisdiction. Reference in this regard can be made to V. Ramamirtham Vs. Rama Film Service AIR 1951 Madras 93 (FB) where it was held in the lead judgment that while Section 15 of the CPC enjoins the institution of a suit in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try it, it does not oust the jurisdiction of the Court of a higher grade; even if the Court of a higher grade tries and disposes of a suit which could have been instituted in a Court of a lower grade, the decision rendered is not without jurisdiction and is not a nullity. Viswanatha Sastri, J. in his concurring opinion observed that the object of Section 15 CPC is only to prevent superior Courts being flooded or overcrowded with suits triable by Courts of inferior grade and it merely regulates procedure and not jurisdiction. It was further held that a Court of superior grade does not act without jurisdiction in trying a suit which under Section 15 might and ought, by reason of its valuation, to have been tried by an inferior Court. A Full Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh also in Kesavarapu Venkateswarlu Vs. Sardharala Satyanarayana AIR 1957 Andhra Pradesh 49 held that Section 15 CPC lays down a rule of procedure and not of jurisdiction of the superior Court. This Court also in Taran Jeet Kaur Vs. G.S. Bhatia 2009 (108) DRJ 89 has taken the same view.  K. This Court, in our view, by virtue of Section 5(2) of the High Court Act, is in the hierarchy of pecuniary jurisdiction and the  jurisdiction of this Court under Section 5(2) is not to be understood differently. We may in this regard refer to Bakshi Lochan Singh Vs. Jathedar Santokh Singh AIR 1971 Delhi 277 where the contention before the Division Bench of this Court was that the jurisdiction under Section 5(2) did not make this Court the ―Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction‖ for Delhi with respect to the suits filed thereunder as Section 24 of the Punjab Courts Act provided that the Court of the District Judge shall be deemed to be the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction for Delhi and there cannot be two Principal Civil Courts of Original Jurisdiction. Negativing the said contention the Division Bench held that in view of the non obstante clause contained in Section 5(2), the Court of the District Judge ceased to remain the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction with respect to the suits value whereof was in excess of that prescribed in Section 5(2).  (L)  Notice may further be taken of Section 21 of the CPC, subsection (2) whereof provides that no objection as to the competence of a Court with reference to the pecuniary limits of its jurisdiction shall be allowed by any Appellate or Revisional Court unless such objection was taken in the Court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity, before settlement of issues and unless there has been a consequent failure of justice and which suggests that the outcome of a suit above the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of a Court also cannot be said to be a nullity or without jurisdiction, unless there has been a ―consequent failure of justice‖. Supreme  Court in Kiran Singh Vs. Chaman Paswan AIR 1954 SC 340 was concerned with a situation where the appeal was heard by the District Court instead of by the High Court. The argument, that the right of appeal was a valuable one and that deprivation of the right to have the appeal heard by the High Court constituted prejudice, was held to be based on a misconception. It was held that the right of appeal though is a substantive right and its deprivation is a serious prejudice but no prejudice had been caused because in hearing of the appeal by the District Court, the right of appeal had been enlarged, with the right of second appeal to the High Court which was otherwise not available also becoming available. It was further held that the prejudice must be something other than the appeal being heard in a different forum. It was yet further held that prejudice in Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act, 1887 with which the Supreme Court was concerned in that case does not include errors in findings on question of fact and that prejudice on the merits must be directly attributable to valuation and an error in a finding of fact reached on a consideration of the evidence cannot possibly be said to have been caused by valuation. Mere errors in the conclusions on the point for determination were held to be not amounting to prejudice. Giving instances of prejudice, it was observed that if there is no proper hearing that had resulted in injustice or if the procedure followed in that Court is different or the right of appeal arising therefrom is different, can a case for prejudice be made out.  (M)  The law thus makes a distinction between a case of lack of inherent jurisdiction and a case of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction. While a decree passed by the Court lacking pecuniary jurisdiction does not automatically become void; at the most becomes voidable in the sense that it can be appealed on limited grounds,a decree passed by a Court with lack of inherent jurisdiction becomes null and void in law and its validity can be set up whenever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution or even in collateral proceedings.  (N)  The Division Bench of this Court in Mahesh Gupta supra, in holding that an application for amendment of a plaint to enhance valuation for the purposes of pecuniary jurisdiction cannot be entertained by this Court after the coming into force of the Amendment Act, if we may respectfully say so, fell in error in reasoning that ―the Court which does not have jurisdiction to try the matter would have no jurisdiction to pass any orders which affect the rights of the parties‖ and that ―the orders which are passed by a Court which has no jurisdiction to determine the matter, are without jurisdiction and, therefore, of no effect and purport‖ and that the Court ―which does not have pecuniary jurisdiction cannot pass any orders allowing an application seeking amendment of a plaint to bring the suit plaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of a Court‖. We have already noted herein above the difference between the maximum pecuniary jurisdiction and minimum pecuniary jurisdiction and that the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction does not  mean that the Court has no jurisdiction over suits, valuation whereof for the purposes of jurisdiction is below its minimum pecuniary jurisdiction. The rule of institution of suit in Courts of minimum pecuniary jurisdiction under Section 15 of the CPC, as aforesaid, has to be read along with Section 21 of the CPC.  (O)  That brings us to the Office Order dated 24th November, 2015 supra and the effect thereof. It needs to be also examined, whether the said Office Order takes away the jurisdiction of this Court over matters, which till before its issuance, were within the jurisdiction of this Court so as to say that this Court would cease to have jurisdiction to entertain such an application.  (P)  In our view, the nature of the power in exercise of which the said Office Order has been issued, though having its source in Section 4 of the Amendment Act, is administrative in its essence. Justice R.C. Lahoti, speaking for this Court in D.P. Bhalla Vs. Cement Corporation of India Ltd 58 (1995) DLT 188 concerned with a similar Office Order issued pursuant to the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 1991 enhancing the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court from earlier existing of Rs.1 lakh and above to Rs.5 lakhs and above, held that the Office Order has to be given an object oriented interpretation; cases in which issues have been framed means the cases which are ripe for trial on merits; if only preliminary issues have been framed and not all the issues arising for decision in the suit, it cannot be retained in the High Court for it cannot be deemed that it was ripe and ready for trial. It  was further held that cases where inspite of issues having been framed there may have been a development of events which may render previously framed issues redundant, were also not exempted.  (Q)  Reference may also be made to the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in Subhash Chand Goel Vs. Union of India 1997 SCC Online HP 38 in the context of the Himachal Pradesh Courts (Amendment) Act, 1994 enhancing the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court of the District Judge in original civil suits from earlier existing of Rs.2 lakhs to Rs.5 lakhs and that of Subordinate Courts from earlier existing of Rs.60,000/-to Rs.2 lakhs and the Office Order issued by the Chief Justice in pursuance thereto. It was held that the Amendment Act did not provide that the amendments brought into force were retrospective in operation or that they were applicable to pending proceeding but rather conferred power on the Chief Justice to transfer any suit, appeal or proceeding which were pending before the High Court immediately before the commencement of the Amendment Act and thus the Amendment Act did not provide for automatic transfer of any proceeding and if any proceedings were to be transferred on the basis of the amendments, an order had to be passed by the Chief Justice and without which order no proceedings could be transferred. It was further observed that the Amendment Act did not take away the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with any matter in which the value was below that mentioned in the Amendment Act and did not deprive the High Court of its  jurisdiction to deal with any matter irrespective of the value of the subject matter.  It was held that even if a proceeding of a lesser value is pending before a Subordinate Court, it is always open to the High Court to withdraw such proceedings and to dispose of the same.  (R)  The Office Order with which we are concerned also directs the suits below the enhanced minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court ―to be transferred‖ and the transfer to commence from 24th November, 2015. The language thereof is also indicative of this Court not becoming functus officio with respect to suits below its minimum pecuniary jurisdiction on the issuance thereof because the Office Order requires further steps to be taken for the said transfers. In fact, the order of transfer in itself is an exercise of jurisdiction over the said suits, again indicating that on the issuance of the Office Order, this Court did not become functus officio. Till the suit is so transferred, this Court would continue to have jurisdiction.  (S)  Such transfer, we may notice is in the nature of ―transfer of business‖ within the meaning of Section 150 of the CPC which was invoked by the Full Bench of this Court in Arjan Singh Vs. Union of India ILR (1973) 2 Del 933 in the context of creation of original jurisdiction of this Court for the first time vide the High Court Act and the pending proceedings. The same also does not speak of the court from which business is transferred losing its powers.  (T)  Notice at this stage may be taken of Jagdish Prasad Sharma Vs. Standard Brands Ltd. (2006) 135 DLT 698 in the wake  of enhancement of minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court from over Rs.5 lakhs to over Rs.20 lakhs. The same was effected vide Delhi High Court Amendment Act, 2001 passed by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. On challenge thereto being made, a bench of five judges of this Court in Geetika Panwar and Delhi High Court Bar Association Vs. GNCTD (2002) 99 DLT 840 held the same, in so far as amending Section 5(2) as ultra vires the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. However since in the interregnum suits of the valuation of upto Rs.20 lakhs had been filed in and entertained by the District Court, it was ordered that they will remain valid and stand transferred to this court. In appeals preferred to Supreme Court, vide interim order, such transfer was stayed. Before the appeals could be decided, the minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court was enhanced from over Rs.5 lakhs to over Rs.20 lakhs vide Delhi High Court Amendment Act, 2003 of the Parliament. It was the contention in Jagdish Prasad Sharma supra that the decree of the District Court in the suit for over Rs.5 lakhs passed while the appeals were pending in Supreme Court and before the Delhi High Court Amendment Act, 2003, being beyond its pecuniary jurisdiction, was non est. The said argument was rejected. It would thus be seen that the decree in a suit beyond the maximum pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Court also was not interfered with.  (U)  It is also significant that Section 4 permitted Hon‘ble the Chief Justice to not necessarily transfer all suits and the words  therein ―may transfer any suit‖ are indicative of the Chief Justice being empowered to transfer any category of suits, while retaining another category of suits in this Court. If the intent of Section 4 of the Amendment Act or of the Office Order dated 24th November, 2015 had been to transfer the suits, the valuation whereof for the purposes of jurisdiction was Rs.2 crores or less, without any further act to be done by the Court the words used would have been that the suits ―shall stand transferred‖ as were used in Section 16 of the High Court Act with respect to transfer of pending proceedings to this Court on creation vide Section 5(2) of the Original Civil Jurisdiction of this Court. The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 also uses the words ―shall stand transferred‖. Supreme Court in Allahabad Bank Vs. Canara Bank (2000) 4 SCC 406 (overruled on another point in Andhra Bank Vs. Official Liquidator (2005) 5 SCC 75) and in Hara Parbati Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd. Vs. UCO Bank (2000) 9 SCC 716 explained that the same indicates automatic transfer, with the High Court being required only to perform the ministerial act of transferring the papers to the Tribunal. Similar were the words used in Section 8 of the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 which came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in Konda Lakshmana Bapuji Vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh (2002) 3 SCC 258.  (V)  We find that the learned Single Judge in Kamal Sharma supra has reasoned that transferring the suit, requiring the plaintiff to argue the application for amendment of the plaint before the Court  of the District Judge / Additional District Judge and the District Judge / Additional District Judge to, in the event of allowing the amendment, return the plaint for being filed in this Court and retaining the rest of the file in the District Court would be injurious to the substantial cause of justice and which reasoning we fully endorse.  (W) This Court in Aviat Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Magna Laboratories (Gujarat) Pvt. Ltd. AIR 2006 Delhi 115 was concerned with a petition under Section 24 of the CPC for transfer of suit instituted in the Court of the District Judge, within whose pecuniary jurisdiction the suit fell at the time of institution, to this Court after the amendment of the plaint, enhancing the valuation to beyond that of which the District Judge had pecuniary jurisdiction. The petition was opposed on the ground that the only course open to the District Judge after allowing the amendment enhancing the pecuniary jurisdiction was to return the plaint to be filed in the Court of appropriate pecuniary jurisdiction and in exercise of powers under Section 24 of the CPC, only such a suit could be transferred to this Court which was on the date of the petition under Section 24 of the CPC within the jurisdiction of the District Judge. The reason for applying under Section 24 of the CPC was to enable the entire file of the suit containing the proceedings held till then to be transferred this Court, rather than only the plaint being returned. It was held that both Section 24 as well as Order VII Rule 10 of CPC fall in the domain of procedural law and the intent of procedural law always is  to achieve the comments of justice and not to frustrate the same or to throttle the progress of the proceedings in a manner which would be prejudicial to the very administration of justice and expeditious disposal of the suits. It was held that judicial discretion is to be exercised and provisions of a statute are to be interpreted in a manner which would further the cause of justice, rather than in the manner which would frustrate the same. Finding that requiring the plaint to be returned and thereafter being filed in this Court would entail loss of time and which could be saved by exercise of power under Section 24 of the CPC, it was held that it is difficult to accept the reasoning that loss of pecuniary jurisdiction before a Court, whether by virtue of operation of law or by act of the parties covered by an order of the Court, should be permitted to vest parties with different consequences in law, particularly when one of such consequences could be adverse to the very system of expeditious disposal of suits.  (X)  Notice in this regard may also be taken of the fact that as far as the Union Territory of Delhi is concerned, the law with respect to a large category of suits, valuation whereof is permitted to be done by the plaintiff who is dominus litis vests an election in the plaintiff to invoke the jurisdiction, either of the Court of the Civil Judge or of the District Judge or of this Court depending upon the valuation given of the reliefs claimed in the suit. This Court in Govind Gopal Vs. Banwari Lal AIR 1983 Del 323 held that Section 7(v) of the Court Fees Act, 1870 gives a discretion to the plaintiffs  to put their own valuation on the relief for the purpose of court fees. The Full Bench of the High Court of Patna also in Md. Alam Vs. Gopal Singh AIR 1987 Patna 156 held that in suits falling under Section 7(iv) of the Court Fees Act, irrespective of the various subclauses thereof, the estimation of the relief by the plaintiff has to be ordinarily accepted, unless the plaintiff is found to have manifestly and deliberately undervalued or underestimated the same.  (Y)  When the law vests the plaintiff with such an election, we are also of the view that such a plaintiff who has opted to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court cannot be deprived of electing to retain the suit in this Court and which suit otherwise by virtue of the Amendment Act and the Office Order aforesaid would stand transferred to the Subordinate Courts. Supreme Court in Management Committee of Montfort Senior Secondary School Vs. Vijay Kumar (2005) 7 SCC 472 held that where there are plural or multiple remedies available, the principle of dominus litis has clear application and that there is an inherent right in every person to bring a suit of a civil nature and unless the suit is barred by statute, one may, at one‘s peril bring a suit of one‘s choice and it is no answer to a suit that the law confers no such right to sue; a suit for its maintainability requires no authority of law and it is enough that no statute bars it. It was further held that the plaintiff as dominus litis is the master of and has dominion over the case and is the person who has carriage and control of an action and in whom in case of conflict of jurisdiction, the choice of forum lies, unless there  be a rule of law excluding access to a forum of the plaintiff‘s choice or permitting recourse to a forum will be opposed to public policy or will be an abuse of the process of law. In the same vein in Lakha Ram Sharma supra in the context of an application for amendment of plaint enhancing the valuation of the suit from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.10 lakhs in the wake of an earlier change in minimum pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court, it was held that merely because an amendment may take the suit out of the jurisdiction of a Court is no ground for refusing that amendment and the amendment was allowed. Reference in this regard may also be made to Dr. Subramaniam Swamy Vs. Ramakrishna Hegde (1990) 1 SCC 4 where also it was held that the plaintiff as dominus litis has a right to choose the Court and the defendant cannot demand that the suit be tried in a particular Court convenient to him and to Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. Vs. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (2009) 8 SCC 646 also holding that if a plaintiff is entitled to maintain an action in two different forums, he may choose one of them being dominus litis. The same is the view in the illuminating judgment of Justice H.L. Anand of this Court in Hans Raj Kalra Vs. Krihan Lal Kalra (1976) ILR 2 Delhi 745 holding that Section 7(iv) of the Court Fees Act gives a right to the plaintiff to place any valuation that he likes on the relief that he seeks and that the Court has no power to interfere with the plaintiff‘s valuation.  (Z)  We have also perused Anil Goel Vs. Sardari Lal 75 (1998) DLT 641 noticed in Mahesh Gupta supra and where a learned Single Judge of this Court without discussion and relying on Lok Kalyan Samiti Vs. Jagdish Prakash Saini (1995) 33 DRJ 290 held that amendment of plaint to raise valuation of the suit for the purposes of jurisdiction and court fees so as to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of the Court is likely to defeat the provisions of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 1991 and could not be allowed. A perusal of Lok Kalyan Samiti supra shows that the reason given therein also for refusing the amendment was that it would defeat the provisions of the Amendment Act, 1991 and was not found necessary for adjudication of the questions in controversy in the suit. In our view, the said two judgments are not good law, in view of Lakha Ram Sharma supra.",

The said property was originally owned by Jaswant Singh Uppal. It appears that, during his life time, the said Jaswant Singh had entered into a collaboration agreement dated 09.06.1995 with M/s. Gandhi Architects Pvt. Ltd. (third defendant). It is stated in the plaint that the said third defendant, M/s. Gandhi Architects Pvt. Ltd. (also referred to as ―the builder‖) was a family concern of, and managed by, S.K. Gandhi (original first defendant, since deceased) and his wife Geeta Gandhi (second defendant). It is stated that in terms of the collaboration agreement, the builder was to re-develop the property, inter alia, by constructing two additional floors and, by way of his consideration, was to receive the title to the entire second floor with front half terrace above the second floor besides right side driveway with servant room on the second floor of garage block (described in entirety as the ―builder‘s share‖). The plaintiff claims to have purchased, alongwith her husband Ashvini Kumar Malik, by two separate registered sale deeds, both dated 31.12.1996, the first floor of the property from its erstwhile owner, Jaswant Singh Uppal. After his demise on 05.02.2000, the right, title and interest in the property of Jaswant Singh  Uppal devolved on his wife Pritam Kaur Uppal. It is stated that, by registered gift deed dated 07.09.2001, Pritam Kaur Uppal transferred her right, title and interest in the ground floor portion of the property in favour of her son, Raminder Singh Uppal. The plaintiff states that Raminder Singh Uppal and Pritam Kaur Uppal had entered with her into an agreement to sell on 26.03.2009, duly registered with the Sub-Registrar, in respect of the entire ground floor portion with front lawn and back court yard besides exclusive ownership of the left side driveway alongwith garage on right side drive way, and a toilet next to the staircase on the rear side (ground floor portion) with rear half terrace above second floor and one servant room and bathroom above the second floor of garage floor (second floor terrace portion) alongwith one-third undivided and indivisible share in the land underneath alongwith all fixtures and fittings, etc. in the subject property (described in entirety as ―the plaintiff‘s property‖), following it up by a proper transfer through registered sale deed executed on 01.05.2009. The plaintiff has pleaded that pursuant to the collaboration agreement, the first and second defendants have been in occupation and possession of the second floor portion and part of the terrace above the second floor (the builder‘s share).",

IA No.1603/2016 (for modification of order dated 08.01.2016) and IA No.1860/2016 (for refund of excess of court fees paid) came up before the learned single bench on 08.02.2016.

The learned single Judge by his order dated 08.02.2016 disposed of the said application as having been rendered infructuous ‗for the time being‘ though reserving liberty to the defendants (which includes Subhashini Malik, the plaintiff herein) to raise the issue about valuation and / or court fee. Again, keeping the other application (of Geeta Gandhi for refund of excess court fee) pending to be considered and decided by the ‗concerned jurisdictional court‘ falling under the District & Sessions Judge (South East), Saket Courts, New Delhi, observing that this court ‗no longer has pecuniary jurisdiction in terms of the existing plaint‘ (i.e. the plaint in the suit instituted by Geeta Gandhi, second defendant herein), by the same order dated 08.02.2016, the learned single judge  held that in terms of office order dated 24.11.2015, issued by Hon‘ble the Chief Justice in exercise of powers conferred by Section 4 of Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015, ordinary suits (which are not commercial matters), having pecuniary jurisdiction upto the value of Rs.2 Crores cannot be tried by this court.

Balar Marketing Pvt. Ltd.  (2008) 17 SCC 671 and Mount Mary Enterprises vs. Jivratna Medi Treat Pvt. Ltd., (2015) 4 SCC 182, arguing that it is the prerogative of the plaintiff to put valuation to the relief claimed and by allowing the prayer for amendment, no prejudice or irreparable harm were to be caused to the defendants nor the nature of the suit to undergo a change. It was submitted that while considering such an amendment, the court is not expected to go into the merits of the matter and merely because an amendment may take the suit out of the jurisdiction of a particular forum is no ground for refusing such amendment to be incorporated. It is pointed out that this is the spirit keeping which in view a number of learned single benches of this court have permitted similar amendments to be incorporated, in some cases with the clear assertion that the intent and objective of amendment to the valuation was to retain the case before this court thereby precluding its transfer to the file of the District Courts on account of change of the pecuniary jurisdiction by the Amendment Act of 2015.

GNCTD, (2002) 99 DLT 840. Reference is made in the same context to Bakshi Lochan Singh Vs. Jathedar Santokh Singh, AIR 1971 Delhi 277 to add that by virtue of Section 5(2) of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, this court is in the hierarchy of pecuniary jurisdiction.

In their opinion, the amendment Act of 2015 is ―prospective in nature‖ and ―thus not affecting the suits instituted prior to coming into force thereof‖ and further that the office order issued by the Chief Justice on 24.11.2015 in exercise of the powers conferred upon her by Section 4 of Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015 does not result in the ―automatic transfer‖ of the pending cases covered by such dispensation nor ―take away the jurisdiction of the High Court‖ to deal with matters involving lesser value, not the least rendering this court functus officio. It has been observed that the power in exercise of which office order dated 24.11.2015 has been issued by Hon‘ble the Chief Justice is, in essence, ―administrative‖ and that the transfer of pending cases in its wake is in the nature of ―transfer of business‖ within the meaning of the provision contained in Section 150 CPC, for which reason the court does not loose its powers to exercise its inherent jurisdiction. Based on the principles summarized in Manager, VKNM Vocational Higher Secondary School Vs. State of Kerala, (2016) 4 SCC 216 and Rajesh D. Darbar Vs.

Valuation of the suit for purposes of court fees and valuation for the purpose of jurisdiction are, therefore, two distinct matters. While in suits for which a fixed court fee is payable valuation of the subject matter for purposes of court fee is unnecessary, valuation for purposes of jurisdiction of courts is essential in all suits. Ordinarily valuation of a suit for one purpose has no impact on the valuation for the other purpose. However, of the Suits Valuation Act incorporates an exception when it provides that \"where any suits other than those referred to in the  Section 7,  Court Fees Act,  Fees Act, 1870, paragraphs v, vi, and ix and paragraph x, clause (d), court fees are payable ad valorem under the 1870, the valuation as determinable for the computation of court fees and the value for purposes of jurisdiction shall be the same\". The effect of this provision is that in certain type of suits envisaged by the provision the value determinable for the computation of court fees is also determinative of the value for purposes of jurisdiction.

It is therefore necessary that the plaintiff should take care that the valuation is adequate and reasonable taking into account the circumstances of the case. In coming to the conclusion that the suit is undervalued the court will have to take into account that in a suit for accounts the plaintiff is not obliged to state the exact amount which would result after the taking of the accounts. If he cannot estimate the exact amount he can put a tentative valuation upon the suit for accounts which is adequate and reasonable.

The general proposition expressed by the doctrine is that if a point of law has been  decided by the higher court, it is of ―binding authority‖ in all the courts of such jurisdiction. Undoubtedly, as Roscoe Pound said, the legal order must be flexible as well as stable because ―continual changes in the circumstances of social life demand continual new adjustments to the pressure of other social interests as well as to new modes of endangering security‖ [see Law Finding Through Experience and Reason Three Lectures by Roscoe Pound, University of Georgia Press, Athens, 1960]. But formulation of new normative has to be for reasons properly made out and by appropriate authority.

Sumant  Bharatram and Ors. which had been instituted on the original side of this court, inter alia, to seek maintenance in a matrimonial dispute, a subject matter falling under the jurisdiction of Family Courts under Sections 7(1)(a) of the Family Courts Act, 1984. A learned single judge in seisin of the matter had referred a question of law for adjudication that necessitated consideration of the status of the High Court while exercising the original civil jurisdiction. It is in this context the decision was rendered, inter alia, as under :  ―23. ...Although Section 2(4) (of CPC) does not expressly seek to define the term ―District Court‖, the meaning that emerges therefrom also includes the definition of ―District Court‖. This is because the term ―District Court‖ is defined (in parenthesis) to mean the principal civil court of original jurisdiction that exercises such jurisdiction over a defined territory. Now, Section 5(2) of the Delhi High Court Act provides that the High Court shall exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit where the value of the suit exceeds a certain limit (presently rupees 2 crores). Therefore, the court of ordinary original jurisdiction in Delhi for the purposes of suits exceeding such pecuniary value would be the High Court, and for all other purposes, it would be the District Court. This would be the result of a combined reading of Section 5(2) with Section 24 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1918, which provides that the court of District Judge shall be the District Court or the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in the District. Therefore, when it is clarified in Section 2(4) that ―district‟ would include the local limits of a High Court exercising original civil jurisdiction, axiomatically, such High Court would be a ―District Court‖ to the limited extent that it is exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction....‖",

Bhalla Vs.Cement Corporation of India Ltd.,  58  (1995) DLT 188, inter alia, with observation that the preliminary issue being a mixed question of fact and law could not be decided except after recording evidence and, thus, the case could not be treated as one in which issues had been framed.

The issue had arisen upon a reference made by a court of Sessions to which  a case involving such offences instituted prior to the amendment had been committed by the court of Magistrate.

The majority view refers to V. Ramamirtham (supra), Kesavarapu Venkateswarlu (supra) and Taran Jeet Kaur (supra) to observe that while a court is said to be not having jurisdiction to try the suit above its maximum pecuniary jurisdiction, the converse is not true. As observed in V. Ramamirtham (supra), the object of Section 15 CPC is to prevent the superior courts from being flooded or over-crowded with suits triable by courts of inferior grade. The amendment of 2015 enhanced the pecuniary jurisdiction of the district courts and also made provision for transfer of the pending cases pertaining to such pecuniary limits from this court to the district courts.

In the teeth of clear enunciation of law by binding precedents that this court ceases to have jurisdiction in such matters upon promulgation of the order by the Chief Justice under Section 4, adjudication upon any such applications (for amendment) would be non-est and improper usurpation of power. Pragmatism in such situation is a slippery slope and may set a precedent open to abuse. Pragmatism does not create jurisdiction where none exists.

The key words (for present discussion) in the 8th explanation referred to above are ―competent to decide such issue‖. Once it is concluded that the order issued by the Chief Justice in exercise of power conferred upon her by  Section 4 of the amendment Act is analogous to subordinate legislation, the first or foremost issue over which the exercise of jurisdiction has to be restricted concerns as to the continued maintainability of the case before this Court. Indeed, every court has the inherent jurisdiction to decide if the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the lis before it vests in it or not. But, if the answer to this question is found in the negative, it is beyond its competence to create jurisdiction (which does not exist) under the cover of exercising ―jurisdiction to determine the scope of its own jurisdiction‖ – not the least where it has the effect of defeating the legislative intent.

The amendment application is thus either to be decided by the single Judge on the Original Side of this Court or by the Judge presiding over the transferee court. Any opinion on the merits would create difficulty and, therefore, I have avoided any comments touching on merits. Some reference has been made in the judgments of my brothers to principles of amendment, which I believe are of general nature.",

This has been called the ‗bootstrap doctrine‘, the idea being that a court which initially had no jurisdiction can when the issue is  litigated lift itself into jurisdiction by its own incorrect but conclusive finding that it does have jurisdiction.‖  This doctrine has its limitations especially when the enactment itself states that the judgment of the court of the limited jurisdiction can be challenged in collateral proceedings, or is not finally determinative, or when the defendant has not appeared. In the first situation, the question would arise whether the Legislature had granted power to the Court or forum of limited jurisdiction, the authority to decide its own jurisdiction. Indeed the Explanation VIII quoted above uses the expression ―competent to decide such issue‖.

The answer to these contentions must depend on what the position in law is when a court entertains a suit or an appeal over which it has no jurisdiction, and what the effect of Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is on that position. It is a fundamental principle well established that a decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity could be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied upon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject-matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties. If the question now under consideration fell to be determined only on the application of general principles governing the matter, there can be no doubt that the District Court of Monghyr was coram non judice, and that its judgment and decree would be nullities. The question is what is the effect of Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act on this position.",

                        "content": "Section 11 enacts that notwithstanding anything in Section 578 of the Code of Civil Procedure an objection that a court which had no jurisdiction over a suit or appeal had exercised it by reason of overvaluation or undervaluation, should not be entertained by an appellate court, except as provided in the section. Then follow provisions as to when the objections could be entertained, and how they are to be dealt with. The drafting of the section has come in — and deservedly — for considerable criticism; but amidst much that is obscure and confused, there is  one principle which stands out clear and conspicuous. It is that a decree passed by a court, which would have had no jurisdiction to hear a suit or appeal but for overvaluation or undervaluation, is not to be treated as, what it would be but for the section, null and void, and that an objection to jurisdiction based on overvaluation or undervaluation, should be dealt with under that section and not otherwise. The reference to Section 578, now Section 99 CPC, in the opening words of the section is significant. That section, while providing that no decree shall be reversed or varied in appeal on account of the defects mentioned therein when they do not affect the merits of the case, excepts from its operation defects of jurisdiction. Section 99 therefore gives no protection to decrees passed on merits, when the courts which passed them lacked jurisdiction as a result of overvaluation or undervaluation. It is with a view to avoid this result that Section 11 was enacted. It provides that objections to the jurisdiction of a court based on overvaluation or undervaluation shall not be entertained by an appellate court except in the manner and to the extent mentioned in the section. It is a self-contained provision complete in itself, and no objection to jurisdiction based on overvaluation or undervaluation can be raised otherwise than in accordance with it. With reference to objections relating to territorial jurisdiction, Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code enacts that no objection to the place of suing should be allowed by an appellate or Revisional Court, unless there was a consequent failure of justice. It is the same principle that has been adopted in Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act with reference to pecuniary jurisdiction. The policy underlying Sections 21 and 99 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act is the same, namely, that when a case had been tried by a court on the merits and judgment rendered, it should not be liable to be reversed purely on technical grounds, unless it had resulted in failure of justice, and the policy of the legislature has been to treat  objections to jurisdiction both territorial and pecuniary as technical and not open to consideration by an appellate court, unless there has been a prejudice on the merits. The contention of the appellants, therefore, that the decree and judgment of the District Court, Monghyr, should be treated as a nullity cannot be sustained under Section 11 of the Suits Valuation Act.‖  A reading of the aforesaid paragraphs would show that the Supreme Court had accepted the general principle that a decree passed by the court without jurisdiction is a nullity and the plea of invalidity can be raised at the stage of execution or even in collateral proceedings. However, the Supreme Court did make a distinction between subject-matter and pecuniary/ territorial jurisdiction and observed that the question of over or undervaluation cannot be entertained by the appellate court, except when provided in Section 21 of Code. This principle stands out and is clear. The question of over-valuation or under-valuation has to be dealt with as per the terms of the said Section and not otherwise for when a judgment is rendered on merits, it should not be reversed purely on technical grounds, unless it has resulted in the failure of justice. Even on the question of subject-matter jurisdiction, some dent has been made by incorporation of Explanation VIII to Section 11 CPC, which pertains to res judicata and binding force on a judgment even of a court of limited jurisdiction, provided it is competent to decide the issue of jurisdiction. In that event, an unsuccessful party cannot initiate collateral proceedings notwithstanding that the court of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such proceeding or issues. It is difficult to accept and approve that a contesting losing side/defendant can file a suit to declare a decree  as a nullity for want of pecuniary jurisdiction. Collateral separate proceedings would not lie and would be rejected.",

Court in which suits to be instituted.-Every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try it.”  The aforesaid Section in simple and plain language states every suit has to be instituted in the court of the lowest grade competent to try it. When a suit is triable by a court of the lowest grade but is instituted in a court of higher grade, the latter court has jurisdiction to examine the question of its own jurisdiction and return the plaint if it does not have jurisdiction. It is the valuation in the plaint that determines jurisdiction, the averments made in the written statement generally being irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction. However, in view the provisions of Section 11 of the Suit Valuation Act, 1887 and the decisions of the Supreme Court in Tara Dev versus Thakur Radha Krishna Maharaj, AIR1987 SC 2085, Nandita Bose versus Ratanlal Nahata, AIR 1987 SC 1947, it is settled principle that although the plaintiff‘s valuation of a suit determines the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court, such valuation of claims cannot be arbitrary. In V. Ramamirtham, Sole Proprietor, Glorious Pictures versus Rama Film Service, AIR 1951 Madras 93 (FB), Viswanatha Shastri, J. opined that the object of Section 15 of the Code is to prevent superior courts from being flooded or over-crowded with suits triable by the inferior courts. The Section primarily regulates the procedure and not ―jurisdiction‖.  The Section recognises that courts or more than one court would have jurisdiction to try a suit and, therefore, uses the expression ‗ the court of the lowest grade‘. Reference to this Full Bench decision is not with a view to undermine the salutary object of Section 15 of the Code, but to highlight the difference between subject matter and pecuniary jurisdiction, the latter being dependent on the valuation of the suit These are different and distinct facets of jurisdiction, all of which cannot be put in a straitjacket.",

However, there has been a subsequent change in the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Court. The High Court of Delhi then had jurisdiction to try all civil suits valued at Rs.20 lacs or more. With the enactment of the Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2015 (the Amending Act, for short) with effect from 26th October, 2015, the words ―rupees twenty lakhs‖ in sub-section (2) to Section 5 of the Delhi High Court Act, 1996  stand substituted for the words ―rupees two crore‖. Section 5(2) of the Delhi High Court Act prior to and post the amendment dated 26th October, 2015 would read as under:- ―Pre-amendment  5(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the High Court of Delhi shall also have in respect of the said territories ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which exceeds rupees twenty lakhs.  Post-amendment  5(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the High Court of Delhi shall also have in respect of the said territories ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which exceeds rupees two crore‖.  The aforesaid Section deals with the institution of suits and not with the transfer of suits. It would therefore, not be correct to accept the proposition that on the amendment of Section 5 and substitution of the words ―rupees twenty lacs‖ with ―rupees two crores, the suits which were validly instituted in the Delhi High Court, would no longer be triable because the Delhi High Court has lost pecuniary jurisdiction with effect from 26th October, 2015. The difference between institution and transfer of jurisdiction, which happens post the institution, and the triability of the pending litigation was examined and elucidated by the Supreme Court in Ramesh Kumar Soni versus State of Madhya Pradesh, (2013) 14 SCC 696. This decision though in a criminal matter, draws a distinction between jurisdiction at the time of institution of proceedings and an amendment applicable to pending cases, which were validly instituted and have to be transferred to another forum/court. In New India Insurance Company Limited versus Shanti Misra, (1975) 2 SCC 840, the Supreme Court had held that change of forum by way of law can operate retrospectively and would be  applicable even if the cause of action or right of action had accrued prior to the change of forum. A plaintiff had a vested right of action but not a vested right of forum. Unless, by express words, the new forum is made available only to such cause of action as arises subsequent to the creation of the forum, the general rule is to give retrospective effect to the change, However, in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur and Others versus State of Maharashtra and Others, (1994) 4 SCC 602 it has been held that a statute, which affects substantive rights, is presumed to be prospective in operation, unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. Further, an amendment to a procedural statute, unless such construction is textually impossible, is presumed to be retrospective in application. A procedural statute should not generally be applied retrospectively where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or impose new duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.",

When a specific provision is made in form of Section 4 of the Amending Act, then the said provision would override the general  assumption that all pending proceedings would also be transferred. Section 4 of the Amending Act mandates and requires the Chief Justice to pass a specific order to transfer suits or other proceedings and it is only in terms of the said order that the pending matters would be transferred. Intendment is to the contrary. In these circumstances, I do not think the decision in the case of Delhi High Court Bar Association (supra) correctly holds that all pending matters stood transferred in view of language of sub-section (2) to Section 5 of the Delhi High Court Act, post the amendment. The amendment made in sub-section (2) to Section 5 has to be read in the light of, and harmoniously with Section 4 of the Amending Act and not in isolation and de hors the said section. R.K. Gauba, J. in his conclusion has rightly observed that the transfer of pending cases under Section 4 of the Amendment Act of 2015 required the Chief Justice to take a decision and issue an order (See Paragraph 118). The same being analogous to delegated legislation would be the foundation and the basis of transfer of the cases. If we would accept the ratio of the Delhi High Court Bar Association as correct, then by operation of Section 5(2) of the Amending Act all orders post 26th October, 2015 till 24th November, 2015 in suits value of which was Rs.2 Crores or less would be questionable on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

Before deciding and elucidating my reasons why the High Court would have power and retains jurisdiction and is not functus officio to decide the said application, I would like to first reproduce the office order dated 24th November, 2015 passed by Hon‘ble the Chief Justice under Section 4 of the Amending Act of 2015.

(ii) All suits or other proceedings the value of which exceeds rupees one crore but does not exceed rupees two crores, other than those relating to commercial disputes the specified value of which is not less than rupees one crore (as defined in the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Ordinance, 2015), pending in the Delhi High  Court on the Original Side, excepting those cases in which final judgments have been reserved , be transferred to the jurisdictional subordinate courts.  The transfer of cases to the subordinate courts shall commence from today, i.e. 24.11.2015.‖   The notification draws a distinction between cases where final judgment has been reserved and others and stipulates that all suits and proceedings pending in the Original Side of the Delhi High Court which are valued at exceeding Rs.2 crores (Rs. 1 crore in commercial cases) would be transferred to the jurisdictional subordinate court. If one strictly goes by the language, then cases in which orders on interim applications including applications for amendment have been reserved, would have to be transferred without pronouncement of the said orders. This, however, does not appear to be the intent and purpose of the notification. The cases in which orders on interim applications have been reserved, can be certainly pronounced, even though after pronouncement the said cases may have to be transferred to the subordinate court.

                        "content": "The primary reason why I feel that the High Court would have the jurisdiction to decide the application for amendment enhancing the pecuniary jurisdiction is that the Original Side of the High Court is still in seisin of the matter till the suit or proceedings are actually ordered to be transferred to the subordinate court. On the question of transfer of a case from the Original Side of the High Court, it is for this Court to examine and determine the valuation of suit made by the plaintiff and  decide whether in terms of the said valuation, the suit should be transferred. Section 5(1) of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 stipulates that the High Court of Delhi shall have all such original, appellate and other jurisdiction as under law in force immediately before the appointed day. Should the Original Side of the High Court in the said matrix not examine the question of valuation or is precluded from examining the question of valuation, is the moot question. My answer to the said question would be in affirmative in view of the discussion above on the general principles relating to jurisdiction. Amendment of a plaint normally, unless otherwise directed, relates back to the date of original filing. The doctrine of relation back stands accepted and recognized in Sampath Kumar versus Ayyakannu and Anr., (2002) 7 SCC 559 and in Siddalingamma and Anr. versus Mamtha Shenoy, (2001) 8 SCC 561 [See also decision dated 26th August, 2015 in Civil Appeal No.6595/2015 L.C. Hanumanthappa @ since dead versus H.B. Shivakumar.]. Therefore, when the pecuniary clause in the plaint is allowed to be amended, it could relate back to the date of original filing of the plaint.",

                        "content": "I would, at this stage, like to refer to a decision of Division Bench of this Court in Mahesh Gupta versus Ranjit Singh and Others, AIR 2010 Delhi 4, and make specific reference to paragraph 7 thereof, which reads:- ―7. The issue therefore is, can this application for amendment be allowed. It is trite that the court which does not have jurisdiction to try the matter would have no jurisdiction to pass any orders which affect the rights of the parties. The orders which are passed by a court which has no jurisdiction to  determine the matter, are without jurisdiction and, therefore, of no effect and purport. The Court therefore which does not have pecuniary jurisdiction cannot pass any orders allowing an application seeking amendment of a plaint to bring the suit plaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of a Court.‖  I  have reservations on the broad proposition as expounded in paragraph 7. Taken to its logical end, it would mean that even the subordinate court would not have jurisdiction to decide an application for amendment for enhancing the pecuniary value, for if the application for amendment is accepted, the subordinate court would not have pecuniary jurisdiction to pass any order. This would result in a situation of circulus inextricabilis. We should avoid Renvoi. The term has been defined in Black‘s Law Dictionary, Eighth Edition (Pg.1324) as the doctrine under which a Court in resorting to foreign law adopts as well the foreign law‘s conflict-of-laws principle which may in turn refer the Court back to the law of the forum. Logically, therefore, we should not follow an approach which leads to infinite regress as this would lead to absurdity. Pertinently, the Division Bench in Mukesh Gupta (supra) had exercised the power under Section 24 of the Code and had retained the suit. It was also observed that the ratio of the decision would not be applicable where the contention of the plaintiff-applicant was that there was a typographical or a clerical error while typing the valuation paragraphs in the plaint.",

                        "content": "Almost identical question had arisen before the Supreme Court in Lakha Ram Sharma versus Balar Marketing Private Limited, (2008) 17 SCC 671 and it was held that it is settled law that merely because an  amendment may take the suit out of jurisdiction of the court is no ground for refusing the amendment. In fact, a reading of the ratio would show that even the converse was upheld. In the said case, the High Court had rejected the amendment on the ground that the valuation of the suit was sought to be increased from Rs.1 lac to Rs.10 lacs so as to only take the suit out from the jurisdiction of that court. It was observed:- ―4. It is settled law that while considering whether the amendment is to be granted or not, the Court does not go into the merits of the matter and decide whether or not the claim made therein is bonafide or not. That is a question which can only be decided at the trial of the Suit. It is also settled law that merely because an amendment may take the suit out of the jurisdiction of that Court is no ground for refusing that amendment. We, therefore, do not find any justifiable reason on which the High Court has refused this amendment. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and that of the trial court is restored. We, however, clarify that as the appellant has now raised the claim from Rs. 1 Lakh to Rs. 10 Lakh, the trial court will determine, whether or not Court Fees are correctly paid.",

But insistence of such a requirement may not be entirely desirable and necessary for it may lead to infinite regress and mandates validation for every action. To avoid this, the law acknowledges that power and authority could be bestowed expropio vigore, from its own strength. Such non-statutory power could be traced to custom, consent or contract or evolution of natural law as understood and developed by human reasoning. The principle that a  court has jurisdiction to determine the scope of its own jurisdiction has gained recognition by the process of evolution. In this manner, the general theory of jurisdiction equates the power to determine with the existence of jurisdiction, to resolve the paradox and dilemma referred to above. If we do not accept and apply this principle, and hold that the principle of legal self-reference is not inherent, and the question or challenge to jurisdiction can only be answered by another court, it would enable a determined party to push back and delay the litigation.",

It enables the Court where the suit is pending to determine and decide the application for amendment relating to pecuniary jurisdiction for if the amendment is allowed or dismissed, the suit will be retained or transferred and parties are not relegated to another court where the application for amendment would then be considered and depending upon the decision, the suit could be re-transferred or returned to be presented in the earlier court. If we follow the second procedure, it would cause delay and make the procedure more cumbersome and difficult. This would not be in the interest of the litigant wanting an expedited and quick disposal. The decision in Lakha Ram’s case (Supra) adopts a pragmatic view to hold that he court is in seisin of the matter can decide the application for amendment even when an amendment, if allowed, would take the suit/proceedings beyond the pecuniary jurisdiction of that Court. As sequitor the High Court being in seisin of the suit, it would not be barred or prohibited from deciding the application for amendment, which if allowed, would have the effect of the suit being tried and decided in the High Court.",

Mr Singla also referred to Section 2(1)(i) of that Act which defined the expression ―Specified value‖ in relation to a commercial dispute to mean the valuation of the subject matter  in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with Section 12 which shall not be less than rupees one crore or such higher valuation as may be notified by the Central Government. Section 12 (1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act stipulates that in determining the ‗specified value‘ of the subject matter of the commercial dispute in a suit, where the relief sought relates to immovable property or to a right therein, the market value of the immovable property, as on the date of the filing of the suit, should be taken into account. It was, therefore, contended by Mr Singla that since the value of the immovable property on the date on which the suit was originally filed was Rs. 1 crore, the stipulation as regards ‗specified value‘ indicated in Section 2(1)(i) read with Section 12(1)(c) was clearly satisfied.

He submitted that the suit does not have any element of a ‗commercial dispute‘ as defined in Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act.

The reason being that the present suit is essentially one seeking cancellation of General Powers of Attorney, Sale Deeds and a decree for possession. Neither General Powers of Attorney nor sale deeds can be regarded as ―agreements relating to immovable property‖. A sale deed brings about a conveyance of property and cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be construed as an ―agreement relating to immovable property‖.

He argued that initially, the suit was filed as quia timet action, thus the relief for enhancement of the damages as mentioned in the present application is malafide. It is done deliberately after the ordinance is passed by the Parliament. He submitted that in case the plaintiffs have now calculated the damages from Rs.20,05,000/-to Rs.2 crores, they should file a separate suit against the defendant. In support of his submissions, learned Senior counsel has referred to a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kuldip Singh v. Subhash Chander Jain and others, (2000) 4 Supreme Court Cases 50 (paras 5, 8 & 12) which reads as under:- “5. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Shri Jaspal Singh, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant has submitted that in the suit filed by the plaintiff- respondents they were seeking an injunction against an apprehended injury likely to be caused by nuisance not in existence on the date of the suit which injunction could not have been granted in the facts and circumstances of the case. In his submission the action initiated by the plaintiff-respondents was quia timet action which, on the settled legal principles, was premature on the date of initiation and hence ought not to have been entertained. The learned counsel for the appellant has invited our attention toFletcher v. Bealey [(1885) 28 Ch D 688 : 54 LJ Ch 424 : 52 LT 541] which in his submission is the leading authority on the point. Shri V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff-respondents has, on the other hand, supported the judgment of the High Court.",

An actually-existing nuisance is capable of being assessed in terms of its quantum and the relief which will protect or compensate the plaintiff consistently with the injury caused to his rights is also capable of being formulated. In case of a future nuisance, a mere possibility of injury will not provide the plaintiff with a cause of action unless the threat be so certain or imminent that an injury actionable in law will arise unless prevented by an injunction. The court may not require proof of absolute certainty or a proof beyond reasonable doubt before it may interfere; but a strong case of probability that the apprehended mischief will in fact arise must be shown by the plaintiff. In other words, a future nuisance to be actionable must be either imminent or likely to cause such damage as would be irreparable once it is allowed to occur. There may be yet another category of actionable future nuisance when the likely act of the defendant is inherently dangerous or injurious such as digging a ditch across a highway or in the vicinity of a children's school or opening a shop dealing with highly inflammable products in the midst of a residential locality.",

Therefore, he submitted that though the merit is not to be considered at the time of considering the application for amendment, the said aspect has to be decided after the trial but still the plaintiffs are showing the prima-facie proof that the intention of the plaintiffs is not malafide. He further submitted that admittedly, after passing of the order dated 12th December, 2011, the defendant continued to manufacture and sell the impugned Bull Smart Backhoe Loader and made considerable profits.

It is settled law that in case the separate suit from the same cause of action is maintainable, it would be appropriate to allow the amendment in the plaint unless the amendments are barred by limitation. Admittedly, the said situation has not occurred in the present case. It is a continuous cause of action as per the settled law by the Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Bengal Waterproof Ltd. Vs. M/s. Bombay Waterproof Manufacturing Co., AIR 1997 SC 1398 (para 20) which reads as under:- “20. ……It is now well settled that an action for passing off is a common law remedy being an action in substance of deceit under the Law of Torts. Wherever and whenever fresh deceitful act is committed the person deceived would naturally have a fresh cause of action in his favour. Thus every time when a person passes off his goods as those of another he commits the act of such deceit. Similarly whenever and wherever a person commits breach of a registered trade mark of another he commits a recurring act of breach or infringement of such trade mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at each time of such infringement to the party aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in such a case when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of proper relief, for all times to come in future defendant of such a suit should be armed with a license to go on committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off with impunity without being subjected to any legal action against such future acts.”",

The plaintiffs at that time had also undertaken to pay the requisite Court fee on the account of the defendants being liable to pay in excess of the amount of Rs.25 lac. Learned Senior counsel for the plaintiffs submits that since the plaintiffs have re-assessed the damages likely to be served, therefore, the relief for rendition of accounts is likely to assess at Rs.1 crore in view of the statement of accounts produced by the defendants.

The appellant had filed a suit claiming that he is the proprietor of a trade mark “KUNDAN” and “KUNDAN CAB” in respect of PVC wires and cables and that the respondent was using the appellant's trade mark. Permanent injunction, rendition of accounts and other reliefs were claimed. The appellant applied for an amendment of the suit. The application for amendment was granted by the trial court. The High Court, however, by the impugned order, has disallowed only one portion of the amendment, namely, where the appellant sought to raise the valuation of the suit from Rs 1,00,000 (Rupees one lakh) to Rs 10,00,000 (Rupees ten lakhs). The High Court has held that such a claim is arbitrary and not based on any cogent material. The High Court has held that the application to raise valuation is not bona fide as it is done with the purpose of taking the suit out of the jurisdiction of that court.",

                        "content": "It is settled law that while considering whether the amendment is to be granted or not, the court does not go into the merits of the matter and decide whether or not the claim made therein is bona fide or not. That is a question which can only be decided at the trial of the suit. It is also settled law that merely because an amendment may take the suit out of the jurisdiction of that court is no ground for refusing that amendment. We, therefore, do not find any justifiable reason on which the High Court has refused this amendment. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and that of the trial court is restored. We, however, clarify that as the appellant has now raised the claim from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakhs, the trial court will determine, whether or not court fees are correctly paid”.",

The Supreme Court has also dealt with the objection raised by the defendant in the said case in para 9 of the application. The relevant paras are reproduced as under:- “2. The facts giving rise to the present litigation in a nutshell are as under: the appellant, who has been described as a plaintiff hereinafter, filed a suit against the present respondent, who has been hereinafter described as a defendant, for specific performance of a contract in relation to the suit property. The suit property was initially valued at Rs 13,50,000 (Rupees thirteen lakhs and fifty thousand only). The plaintiff, thereafter, realised that market value of the property in question was around Rs 1,20,00,000 (Rupees one crore and twenty lakhs only) and therefore, filed an application for amending the plaint. The said application for amendment was rejected by the trial court and thereafter, the aforestated writ petition was filed by the plaintiff challenging the order rejecting the amendment application. The said petition has also been dismissed and therefore, the plaintiff has approached this Court and prayed that the impugned judgment confirming the order rejecting the amendment of the plaint be set aside and the plaintiff be permitted to amend the plaint so as to state correct value of the property in question, which is Rs.1,20,00,000.",

The right to appeal is a vested right that accrues to the litigant from the date the lis commences although it may be actually exercised later when the adverse judgment is pronounced. The said right can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise. The said position of law was laid down beyond pale of controversy by a Constitution Bench of the  Supreme Court in the decision reported as AIR 1957 SC 540 Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry & Others. The Supreme Court followed the celebrated decision of the Privy Council reported as [1905] A.C. 369 The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v. Irving, wherein, it was observed that right to appeal was not a mere matter of procedure but qualitatively different. Further, the Court cited with approval the luminous observations of the Queen's Bench Division in the decision reported as 1884-12 QBD 224 Hough v. Windus, at p. 237 to the effect that a statute should be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested right. Para 23 of the decision in Gari Kapati Veeraya’s case reads as under:- “23. From the decisions cited above, the following principles clearly emerge :  (i)  That the legal pursuit of a remedy, suit, appeal and second appeal are really but steps in a series of proceedings all connected by an intrinsic unity and are to be regarded as one legal proceeding.  (ii)  The right of appeal is not a mere matter of procedure but is a substantive right.  (iii)  The institution of the suit carries with it the implication that all rights of appeal then in force are preserved to the parties thereto till the rest of the career of the suit.  (iv)  The right of appeal is a vested right and such a right to enter the superior court accrues to the litigant and exists as on and from the date the lis commences and although it may be actually exercised when the adverse judgment is pronounced such right is to be governed by the law prevailing at the date of the institution of the suit or  proceeding and not by the law that prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of the filing of the appeal.  (v)  This vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise.”",

It is that wherever Parliament in an earlier statute has directed its attention to an individual case and has made provision for it unambiguously, there arises a presumption that if in a subsequent statute the Legislature lays down a general principle, that general principle is not to be taken as meant to rip up what the Legislature had before provided for individually, unless an intention to do so is specially declared.

The appellant had filed a suit claiming that he is the proprietor of a trade mark “KUNDAN” and “KUNDAN CAB” in respect of PVC wires and cables and that the respondent was using the appellant's trade mark. Permanent injunction, rendition of accounts and other reliefs were claimed. The appellant applied for an amendment of the suit. The application for amendment was granted by the trial court. The High Court, however, by the impugned order, has disallowed only one portion of the amendment, namely, where the appellant sought to raise the valuation of the suit from Rs 1,00,000 (Rupees one lakh) to Rs 10,00,000 (Rupees ten lakhs). The High Court has held that such a claim is arbitrary and not based on any cogent material. The High Court has held that  the application to raise valuation is not bona fide as it is done with the purpose of taking the suit out of the jurisdiction of that court.",

It is also settled law that merely because an amendment may take the suit out of the jurisdiction of that court is no ground for refusing that amendment. We, therefore, do not find any justifiable reason on which the High Court has refused this amendment. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and that of the trial court is restored. We, however, clarify that as the appellant has now raised the claim from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakhs, the trial court will determine, whether or not court fees are correctly paid”.",

The facts giving rise to the present litigation in a nutshell are as under: the appellant, who has been described as a plaintiff hereinafter, filed a suit against the present respondent, who has been hereinafter described as a defendant, for specific performance of a contract in relation to the suit property. The suit property was initially valued at Rs 13,50,000 (Rupees thirteen lakhs and fifty thousand only). The plaintiff, thereafter, realised that market value of the property in question was around Rs 1,20,00,000 (Rupees one crore and twenty lakhs only) and therefore, filed an application for amending the plaint. The said application for amendment was rejected by the trial court and thereafter, the aforestated writ petition was filed by the plaintiff challenging the order rejecting the amendment application. The said petition has also been dismissed and therefore, the plaintiff has approached this  Court and prayed that the impugned judgment confirming the order rejecting the amendment of the plaint be set aside and the plaintiff be permitted to amend the plaint so as to state correct value of the property in question, which is Rs.1,20,00,000.",
