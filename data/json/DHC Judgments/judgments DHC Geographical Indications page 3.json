When further time for the said purpose was sought on 20th December, 2010, the defendant was restrained from using the name “TOLD MOM” and the label which it was then using and to which objection was taken in the plaint.

The defendant ultimately proposed to change the name of its product from “TOLD MOM” to “TALL MOM” but which proposal was rejected by the plaintiff as recorded in the order dated 19th September, 2012.",

Sugars‟ also is prominently displayed on the packaging / label of the products bearing the mark „TOLD MOM‟ and which also distinguishes the two products.",

The difference between IMFL, as the product of the plaintiff is and country liquor, as the defendant claims its product to be, was enquired and it was further enquired as to whether country liquor can be described as rum. The defendant thereafter filed an additional affidavit to the effect that the description by the defendant of its product as rum is in accordance with the Rules prevalent in the State of Punjab, where the defendant‟s product was being marketed and explaining the difference between „Country Liquor Rum‟ and „IMFL Rum‟. It is further stated in the affidavit that country liquor and IMFL are sold through separate licenses. It is thus contended that since the product of the plaintiff is IMFL and the product of the defendant is country liquor, both cannot be sold through the same trade channels shops / vends and for this reason also there is no possibility of confusion amongst the purchasing consumers. In a written note of submissions on record, it is further the case of the defendant that while the product of the plaintiff is sold for Rs.260/-that of the defendant is sold for Rs.110/-.",

                        "content": "The senior counsel for the defendant has referred to / argued:  (i)  To paras No.65 to 68 and 72 to 77 of Khoday Distilleries Limited (Now known as Khoday India Limited) Vs. The Scotch Whisky Association (2008) 10 SCC 723 laying down that when and how a person is likely to be confused is a very relevant consideration; where the class of buyers is quite educated and rich, the test to be applied is different from the one where the product would be purchased by the villagers, illiterate and poor; that ordinarily alcoholic beverages would be purchased by their brand name and when the product is to be purchased both by villagers and town people, the test of a prudent man would have to be applied. It was further held that the test to be applied in a country like India may be different from the test in England, United Sates of America or Australia;  (ii)  Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma Vs. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories AIR 1965 SC 980 as relied upon in Giani Gurcharan Singh Vs. Madhusudhan Singh 2011 (45) PTC 533 (Del) laying down that in an action based upon infringement, if the mark used by the defendant is visually, phonetically or otherwise so close to the registered trademark of the plaintiff that it is found to be an imitation of the registered trademark, the statutory right of the owner of the registered trademark is infringed; it is contended that there is a difference between identical and similar; that Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories supra was a case of identical and not similar; that thus the trademark has to be seen in its entirety. Reference in  this regard was invited to paras No.7 and 8, 26 to 29 of Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories with emphasis being placed on that being a case of imitation and close resemblance and which is not a case here.  (iii)  On enquiry, it was told that the Trademarks Act does not distinguish between IMFL and country liquor, with both being placed in the same class;  (iv)  Attention was however invited to Law of Trade Marks & Geographical Indications by Mr. K.C. Kailasam, Second Edition 2005 on page 490 whereof in the commentary under Section 29, it has been opined by the learned author that the classification of goods and services adopted by the Registry is not the determining or guiding factor for ascertaining similarity of goods and services and the classification is only an administration system, to facilitate search for conflicting marks and examination by the Trademarks Registry. It was thus argued that in the classification under the Trademark Rules, medicines for humans and animals are placed in the same class and thus classification is immaterial. Reliance in this regard was also placed on para No.5 in Chapter V of Kerly‟s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition opining that the fact that certain goods or services may fall within the same class is no evidence that they are of the same description which is the important criteria in considering the restrictions on registrations;  (v)  Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. Vs. The Zamindara Engineering Co. (1969) 2 SCC 727 laying down that though the defendant may be using the plaintiffs mark, the get up of the defendant's goods may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff‟s good and the prices may be so different that there would be no probability of deception of the public. (I may however add that the said observation is in relation to an action of passing off and the Supreme Court observed that in an infringement action, an injunction would issue as soon as it is proved that the defendant is improperly using the plaintiff‟s trademark). (The counsel for the plaintiff also drew attention to para No.6 of the said judgment holding the statutory protection is absolute in the sense that once a mark is shown to offend, the user of it cannot escape by showing that something outside the actual mark itself distinguishes his goods from those of the registered proprietor);  (vi)  Cadila Health Care Ltd. Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (2001) 5 SCC 73 but in which case also there was no registered trademark;  (vii)  The senior counsel for the defendant under instructions also offered the undertaking of the defendant not to sell the goods under the trademark „TOLD MOM‟ and „TOLD MOM Label‟ outside the State of Punjab and / or otherwise than through the Country Liquor Vends;  (viii)  Attention was invited to Section 29(2) of the Trademarks Act and it was contended that the present case would at best fall in Sub-clause (b) thereof, as of similarity to registered trademark and identity or similarity of goods covered by the registered trademark and not in Sub-clause (c) providing for identity with the registered trademark and identity of the goods and it was contended that the presumption under Section 29(3) of likely confusion on the part of the public is available only to cases falling under Sub-clause (c) and not to cases falling under Sub-clause (b);  (ix)  that the judgments relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiff in his written note of arguments on record are of identity of trademark and where the case is not of identity but of similarity, the test as in case of passing off will apply. Attention in this regard was invited to K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar Vs. Shri Ambal & Co., Madras PTC (Suppl.) (1) 258 (SC) relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiff;  (x)  Oxford English Reference Dictionary, Second Edition was cited to contend that „Monk‟ is pronounced as „Mank‟;  (xi)  Kalindi Medicure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 2006 (33) PTC 477 (Del.) where ex parte injunction granted in favour of the registered proprietor of „LOPRIN‟ brand in respect of pharmaceutical products against the use of the word / mark „LOPARIN‟ also in relation to pharmaceutical products  was vacated inter alia for the reason, of the plaintiff‟s product being a non schedule product; while the defendant‟s product was a Schedule-H product, while the plaintiff‟s product was taken orally and sold as a pill, the defendant‟s product was intramuscularly injected with aid of a syringe; and, other factors viz. design, get-up of packing, price, weight etc. and the curative quality of the two products;  (xii)  Carew Phipson Limited Vs. Deejay Distilleries Pvt. Limited AIR 1994 Bom 231 wherein interim injunction was refused on the ground that customers buying the alcoholic beverages subject matter in that case would normally be educated and discerning and are likely to refer to the house mark/trade mark „Blue Riband‟ while buying the same and not simply ask for „Gin N Lime‟ or „ Gin N Orange‟.  (xiii)  McGregor-Doniger Inc. Vs. Drizzle Inc. 599 F.2d 1126 where the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit held that even close similarity between two marks is not dispositive of the issue of likelihood of confusion and similarity in and of itself is not the acid test; whether the similarity is likely to provoke confusion is the crucial test and further holding that difference in price when standing alone though may be insufficient to establish competitive distance but is clearly a factor to be considered along with others in measuring product proximity;  (xiv)  McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Volume 2, para No.23.04[4][e], opining that confusion means more than a call to the mind and it is argued that merely because „TOLD MOM‟ may remind of „OLD MONK‟ is no reason to hold „TOLD MOM‟ to be capable of causing confusion; and  (xv)  Toho Company Ltd. Vs. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 645 Federal Reporter, 2d Series 788 where the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit held that garbage bag seller‟s use of „Bagzilla‟ and slogan „monstrously strong bags‟ posed no likelihood of confusing consumers by suggesting that the trash bags were made, sponsored or endorsed by creators of „Godzilla‟ character.",

(DB) after considering most of the judgments cited hereby on behalf of the defendant, held that the test to be applied is of deceptive similarity and it is to be seen whether the two marks are structurally and phonetically similar and would cause deception in the mind of the consumer and upheld the removal of the trademark „FORZID‟ for the reason of the same being deceptively similar to the earlier registered trademark „ORZID‟, both in relation to pharmaceutical products;  (x)  Identical features on the two labels were highlighted; Reference was made to Volume L. RPC Page 12 to contend that the action of the defendant is dishonest; the defendant initially agreed to change its label but subsequently changed its mind;  I may add that the counsel for the plaintiff in his written note of arguments has also referred to:  (I)  Munday Vs. Carey Vol.XXII, No.10 And Trade Mark Cases, 273 (Club Vs. Hub) where not only the phonetic similarity but dishonesty in adoption was also found;  (II)  Bale & Church Ld. Vs. Sutton Parsone & Sutton & Astrah Products Vol.LI. Reports of Patent, Design, And Trade Mark Cases 129 (Kleenoff Vs. Kleenup) where the use by the defendant of „KLEENUP‟ was held to be so nearly resembling the plaintiff‟s registered mark „KLEENOFF‟ as to be calculated to cause goods sold under the mark „KLEENUP‟ to be taken as the goods of the plaintiff and the test of ordinary memory of ordinary purchaser was applied;  (III)  Essco Sanitation, Delhi Vs. Mascot Industries (India), Delhi 1982-PTC-302 (Essco Vs. Osso) where it was held that a purchaser will seldom have two marks before him and cannot retain in his mind every detail of the mark which he has once seen and will have a general recollection of the nature of the trademark;  (IV)  Pepsico, Inc. Vs. Pure Water Beverages 2011 (47) PTC 147 (Del.) (Aquafina Vs. Aquafine) Where the test of essential features of the mark / label was applied;  (V)  Devi Pesticides Private Ltd. Vs. Shiv Agro Chemicals Industries 2006 (32) PTC 434 (Mad.) (DB) (Super Boom Vs. Boom Plus) holding that where the similarity is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff‟s rights are violated; and  (VI)  K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar Vs. Ambal & Co., Madras PTC (Suppl) (1) 258 (SC) (Ambal Vs. Andal) laying down that nobody can abstract the name and use a phonetically equivalent of it and escape the charge of piracy of the mark pleading that the visual aspect of his mark is different from that of the plaintiff and further holding the name „ANDAL‟ to be not ceasing to be deceptively similar to the name „AMBAL‟ because it was used in conjunction with a pictorial device.",

Though I must confess that the undersigned at least has not till now found so. However at the same time, the vends/shops for country liquor and IMFL especially on the highways and in smaller towns are found adjacent to or in close proximity to each other. It is also not as if the defendant is engaged in the business of sale and marketing of country liquor only. It is the case of the defendant in its written statement itself that it is one of the fastest growing companies and has entered into a technical alliance with M/s Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd., a leading Scotland based Scotch Company, for bottling of imported Scotch and has a vast distribution network in North India owning more than 3000 retail outlets in the States of Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and having a IMFL bottling capacity of 1,50,000 cases per month and country liquor production of over 2,00,000 cases per month. To allow such an entity as the defendant use of the mark “TOLD MOM”, if found to be similar or deceptively similar to the registered trademark “OLD  MONK” of the plaintiff, when both marks are being used for marketing of rum, merely because the rum of the defendant presently falls in the category of Country Liquor and the rum of the plaintiff falls in the category of IMFL would in my opinion be in infringement of the trademark of the plaintiff and affecting the rights of the plaintiff as the proprietor of the registered trademark. It is for this reason only that the undertaking offered by the defendant not to sell the goods under its trademark “TOLD MOM” and “TOLD MOM Label” outside the State of Punjab and/or otherwise than through the Country Liquor Vends is not found to be sufficiently protecting such rights if found of the plaintiff. The use by the defendant of the trademark “TOLD MOM” if found to be similar or deceptively similar to the trademark “OLD MONK” of the plaintiff is likely to affect the goodwill attached to the trademark of the plaintiff. A trademark which distinguishes the goods of one person from those of the other is infringed not only when a average consumer thereof is led into buying the goods of the latter presuming the same to be of the former but also when such consumer by consuming the goods of the latter, under the impression that they are of the former forms an impression/opinion of the quality of the said goods and which impression/opinion guides the further purchases by the customer of the said goods and the reputation which the customs propagates of the goods.",

It is not as if the defendant‟s product is selling for tens of rupees as compared to the plaintiff‟s product of hundreds of rupees. There is plethora of research on the internet indicating that price is a key determinant for access to alcohol and that young people, binge drinkers and heavy drinkers prefer cheaper drinks and those groups are especially responsive to price. Studies have consistently shown that lower socio-economic groups and people with limited disposable income (young people, indigenous groups and heavy drinkers) are more directly impacted by the price of alcoholic products and spirits are twice as price sensitive as wine and beer. A study titled Evidence for the Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Reduce Alcohol-Related Harm conducted in or about the year 2009 by World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe has shown that if prices are raised, consumers reduce their overall consumption and tend to shift to cheaper beverages with heavier drinkers tending to buy the cheaper products within their preferred beverage category. A difference of a hundred odd rupees is not found to be such  which will distinguish the two products. Moreover, in alcoholic beverages, different products in different price range under the same trademark are not unknown. Ready example of Johnnie Walker ranging from the Red to the Blue including Black and Double Black Label, though a high end product, and of beers of varying strength and quality and different prices can be given.",

It was further held that while examining such cases in India, what has to be kept in mind is that the purchaser of such goods in India who may have absolutely no knowledge of English language or of the language in which the trademark is written and to whom different words with slight difference in spellings may sound phonetically the same has to be kept in mine. The test, the Supreme Court held which has to be applied is, whether the misrepresentation made by the defendant is of such a nature as is likely to cause an ordinary consumer to confuse one product for another due to  similarity of marks and other surrounding factors. The Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. supra cited with approval the earlier judgment in Corn Products Refining Co. Vs. Shangrila Food Products Ltd. AIR 1960 SC 142 laying down that English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by English men, which is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity.

The same two marks may be described as similar if the consumers thereof are highly discernable and identical if they are not. The same is the position with respect to identity and similarity of the goods. A highly priced cosmetic item consumed generally by the so-called creamy layer of the society may not be held to be identical but only similar to another cosmetic item. However here  as aforesaid, inspite of the distinction created by the Excise Laws between the product of the plaintiff and the defendant, with the former product falling in the category of IMFL and latter in the category of country liquor, by description of both as rum, the distinction under the Excise Laws dissipates.  I thus find not only identity of the mark of the defendant with the mark of the plaintiff but also identity of the goods covered by both the marks and the case to be falling in Section 29(2)(c) and in which cases as per Section 29(3), the likelihood of confusion on the part of public has to be presumed.",

Even though they may not be the part of the trademark, but because of commonality dilute the difference if any in the remaining label. The Supreme Court as far back as in Parle Products (P) Ltd. Vs. J.P. & Co., Mysore (1972) 1 SCC 618 held that while comparing only the broad and essential features are to be considered and it would be enough if the impugned mark/label bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him.

Though paragraph 4 of Ruston & Hornsby Ltd. supra appears to suggest so but an uncertainty has arisen owing to the language used in paragraph 91 of Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd supra also. The Act, in Section 29 lays down the test of identity, similarity or deceptive similarity with the registered trademark only and not of confusion as in the case of passing-off, on the  anvil of not only similarity of marks but also of prices, trade channels etc. The Act, in Section 2(h) defines deceptive similarity also on the touchstone of resemblance likely to deceive or cause confusion and not extending to pricing, trade channels etc. In my view, since the infringement action is statutory, the test of infringement cannot be extended beyond the parameters of the statute, by incorporating therein factors of pricing, trade channels etc. which are not laid down as tests of infringement in the statute.",

The defendant no. 1 is carrying on business in Mumbai and the defendant no. 2 is the commissioner of customs (Import) Special Investigation and is also having office in Mumbai. The chief commissioner of customs is added as defendant in order to create jurisdiction of this court.  b)  The plaintiff, if aggrieved by the order of Defendant no. 2 had an efficacious remedy available to it under Section 128 of the Customs Act 1962 and could have approached the commissioner of the customs (Appeals) for redressal of its grievances. Therefore, the plaintiff has approached the wrong forum.  c)  The plaintiff’s suit is barred under section 9 of the code of civil procedure as the plaintiff has already opted to file the cancellation petition against the patent before Intellectual Property Appellate Board.  d)  That the defendant no. 2 has done nothing wrong in law as the defendant no. 2 passed all the orders under the rules of 2007 after according the opportunity of being heard to the parties. Thus, the plaintiff suit is bad in law.  e)  On earlier occasion, the right holder approached the Commissioner of custom for enforcement of the patent rights. At that point of time, the custom officials dis not suspend the clearance of the goods and thereafter a writ petition bearing no. 1353/ 2010 was preferred before Bombay High Court which stood withdrawn by the defendant no. 1 wherein the court directed that the  matter would be decided in accordance with the provisions of law. The customs officials are thus doing their duty under the law and nothing else.  f)  It is stated as per the Rule 7 of the Rules of 2007, it is found that the patents granted to the right holders that the process of manufacturing engraved design articles on metals and non metals and improved laser markings and engraving machines is infringed. Thus, the prima facie case has been established by the right holder and nothing wrong has been done by the defendant no. 2. The custom officials have judged the same in those parameters. The plaintiff has filed the replication and rejoinder thereof. The matter thereafter came up for hearing of the pending applications.",

                        "content": "Mr. Hemant Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff has made his submissions which can be outlined in the following manner:  I)  Firstly, Mr. Singh has argued that the present case is maintainable within the jurisdiction of this court as the plaintiff case is based on the threats given by the defendants by way of the complaints and all other actions and there are clear apprehensions that the defendants are likely to interdict the consignments of plaintiff within the jurisdiction of this court. The said fact has been pleaded in the plaint. Mr. Singh has read para 29 of the plaint which reads as under:  “This Hon’ble Court has the jurisdiction to try and entertain the present suit under section 20 (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 on account of plaintiffs having its registered office at Delhi and is carrying on business at Delhi. The frivolous complaint filed by the defendant no. 1 before defendant no. 2 at Mumbai has adversely affected and caused irreparable injury to the business of the plaintiff at Delhi, due to the dynamic effect of the threat of alleged infringement of the  Defendant no. 1 impugned Patent and wrongful interdiction of the plaintiff’s import consignments by the Defendant no. 2. The Defendant no. 3 is also located at Delhi. The part of cause of action has also arisen at Delhi and within the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court.”  Mr. Singh therefore argued that the averments made in the plaint clearly reflect that the plaintiff’s grievance is based on apprehensions that the threats extended by the defendants would have dynamic effect which means that the said threats are/ will consequently harming/ harm the plaintiff in Delhi as well which they have done in Mumbai and thus, this court has jurisdiction to entertain and try the present proceedings.  II)  Mr. Singh, learned counsel has further argued that this court recognized the said principle in the similar cases where there is a likelihood or apprehension that the defendant will harm or injure the plaintiff by exercising a jurisdiction over the subject matter when the plaint avers so.  In order to buttress his argument, Mr. Singh relied upon the following the judgments  i) Jawahar Engineering Company and Ors. v. Jawahar Engineers Pvt. Ltd. reported in 1983 PTC 207.  ii) Pfizer Products, Inc. v. Rajesh Chopra & Ors. reported in 2006 (32) PTC 301 (Del.).  In Pfizer v. Rajesh Chopra (supra) wherein the learned single judge of this court after analyzing the law on the subject of jurisdiction has clearly preserved the actions premised on the threats and has observed that the judgments rendered by the courts in Dhodha House and subsequent line of authorities did not overrule the judgment rendered in Jawahar case (supra) and thus the suit based on  the apprehensions or likelihood of injury within the jurisdiction of the court is maintainable. The learned single judge in paras 6, 7 and 8 observed as under:  “6. Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties, it becomes clear that the point which requires resolution in this matter is what is the ratio of Dhodha House (supra) and whether Dhodha House (supra) in any way unsettles and what has been laid down in Jawahar Engineering (supra). For this purpose, it would be necessary to examine both these decisions in some detail.",

                        "content": "I shall take up Jawahar Engineering (supra) first. Amongst other grounds and issues raised in that case, a Division Bench of this court was faced with the question of territorial jurisdiction in the context of Order 7 Rule 10 of the CPC. The court observed as under:  “There is another ground for holding that the Court has jurisdiction. Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that a suit like the present can be filed wherever the cause of action wholly or partly arises. The plaintiff has prayed for an injunction regarding a threatened breach of a registered trade mark. The learned Single Judge held that the Delhi court does not have jurisdiction on the ground of any sale having been made in Delhi, but does have jurisdiction on account of the advertisement having appeared in the Trade Marks Journal. The real point which gives the Court jurisdiction is not the place where the advertisement has appeared, but the fact that the trade mark is sought for sale in Delhi amongst other places. Furthermore, when an injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the threat should have become a reality before the injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the threat should have become a reality before the injunction and it can even be sought for a threat that is still to materialise.  An injunction being prohibitive in nature is intended to prevent something that is likely to happen. Once the plaintiffs have learnt that the defendants have applied  for registration of trade mark in Delhi, they can claim an injunction to prevent any sale of the infringing product in Delhi. In this sense, the Court will have jurisdiction whether any sale in Delhi has taken place or not. In any case, as already stated, the decision is of a preliminary nature, once the exact scope of what the defendants intend to do is known, it is open to the court to return the plaint. In that sense, it is not a final decision and is not open to appeal at the preliminary stage being not a final adjudication.”",

                        "paragraph_number": 29,
                        "content": "In that case what had happened was that the plaintiffs had learnt that the defendants had applied for registration of the trade mark in Delhi. The advertisement had also appeared in the Trade Mark Journal in various places including Delhi. The Single Judge in that case held that the advertisements in the Journal were not sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the courts in Delhi. A preliminary issue was framed when the matter was before the Single Judge and the issue was : 'Has this court jurisdiction to try the suit? This issue was taken up and on an examination of the evidence, it was found that there was no sale of diesel oil engines in Delhi. The defendants also had claimed that they had not advertised their products in Delhi. The Single Judge hearing the matter held that the jurisdiction of the court could not be invoked as there was no actual sale. He held that there was an advertisement in a Journal called “Parwez” which is published in Ludhiana. He further held that these advertisements were not sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the courts in Delhi. The learned Single Judge also observed that apart from these advertisements, the same had been advertised in the Trade Mark Journal published by the Registrar of Trade Marks at Delhi as a result of which the jurisdiction was conferred in the courts at Delhi. The learned Single Judge hearing the matter did not say anything with regard to the filing of the application at Delhi. It is in this context that the aforesaid observation of the Division Bench was made and it is, Therefore, clear that the observation made by the Division Bench that the place where the advertisement has appeared does not give the court jurisdiction, is in line with what has been decided by the Supreme court in Dhodha House (supra) as will be apparent hereinbelow. However, the Division Bench observed that when an injunction is sought it is not necessary that the threat should have become a reality before an injunction is prayed for and it can even be sought when there is a threat that is still to  materialise. Therefore, the ratio in Jawahar Engineering (supra) is that mere advertisement in the Trade Mark Journal would not give a court jurisdiction. However, a threat that the offending goods could be sold at a particular place would definitely give jurisdiction to the court in such a place. An important aspect of the matter is that the Division Bench also held that an injunction being prohibitive in nature is intended to prevent something likely to happen and once the plaintiffs had learnt that the defendants had applied for registration of a trade mark in Delhi, they could claim an injunction to prevent any sale of the infringing product in Delhi. The Division Bench, Therefore, held that the filing of an application for registration of a trademark in Delhi would give rise to a threat perception in the minds of the people that the offending goods would be sold in Delhi and that would be sufficient to give the courts in Delhi jurisdiction to entertain a suit for passing off.”  Accordingly, Mr. Singh submitted that the present suit is maintainable before the jurisdiction of this court as the same is covered by the observations of this court in Jawahar (Supra) and Pfizer(supra).  III)  Thirdly, Mr. Singh has argued that the actions of the defendant no. 2 by interdicting the consignments which are being imported on the basis of the complaint of the defendant no. 1 are illegal and vexatious as the defendant no. 2 is not within its power to hold the consignments on the basis of the infringement of the patents. Further, this is more so when the defendant no. 2 has been informed about the grounds of the challenge of the patent, therefore, the actions of the defendant no. 2 pursuant to such notice by the plaintiff are illegal.  This is due to the reason that clause 4 of the notification provides for very limited powers to the defendant no. 2 which is to act as an implementing authority so far as the patent infringement is concerned.  Mr. Singh argued that Patent Act and the rules made thereunder no where provides for the adjudicatory functions  assigned to the custom controller or commissioner. Nor, the Custom Acts provide for the same (except the section 11 which does not provide any such powers) and the IPR rules of 2007 which if read with the circular No.41/2007 dated 29th October 2007 would make it clear that the custom authorities are merely acting as implementing authority and would not indulge into the adjudicatory enquiry as to infringement.  On the other hand, Mr. Singh submitted that Section 104 of the Patent Act 1970 (as amended on 2005) clearly provides that once the challenge to the validity of the patent is set up in an infringement proceedings, the matter shall be immediately transferred to the High Court for adjudication. Therefore, the jurisdiction to determine the cases where the challenge is laid in the infringement proceedings vests exclusively with the High Court. Therefore, even assuming that there is any such power to determine the said infringement to the custom controller, once the said challenge is laid before the controller, which is a administrative body cannot proceed to adjudicate the infringement claim and should await the decision of the competent court on merit by adjourning such complaint and should relegate the parties to the civil court. Till that time, the defendant no. 2 should not proceed to act upon the complaint of the defendant no. 1. The continuance of the same by the defendant no. 2 is thus completely illegal and without jurisdiction and consequently causing irreparable harm to the plaintiff.  IV) Mr. Singh, learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that it is the question of the interpretation of the Rules of 2007 along with the circular which have to be interpreted together. It is argued that the defendant no. 2 besides being not the appropriate authority under the  law to determine the infringement of patent issues is also institutionally incompetent to determine the said infringement. Therefore, the said domain of determination of infringement of patent cannot be assigned to the custom controller though it is a different matter that somehow the customs are given the powers to interdict the goods being imported on the basis of patents as an implementing authority.",

                        "content": "Per Contra, Mr. Amarjit Singh Chandhiok, learned ASG and Senior counsel along with Mr. Kamal Nijhawan, learned counsel for the defendant no. 2 and Mr. Amey Nargolkar, learned counsel for the defendant No.1, have made their submissions which can be summarized in the following manner:  a)  Firstly, learned counsel for the defendants has argued that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain and try the present proceedings. It is argued that no part of cause of action has arisen in Delhi. The defendant no. 2 Delhi office has been added in order to make the jurisdiction of the court which this court otherwise does not possess.  It is argued by the learned counsel that the court does not exercise jurisdiction where the small fraction of the cause of action arises. Rather, the judicial trend leans towards the court’s exercising jurisdiction at the places where the substantial part of the cause of action arises.  The defendant nos. 2 and 3 are not necessary parties, they have been impleaded in the suit only for the purpose of invoking jurisdiction. No notice under Section 80 was served  upon them nor leave granted by the Court at the time of registering the suit, Mr. Chandiok submitted they may be deleted from the array of the parties.  b)  Secondly, learned counsel appearing for the defendants argued that the actions of the defendant no. 2 by suspending the release of the goods on the basis of the infringement of the patents is a legally permissible scope of enquiry by virtue of section 11 of the Customs Act read with the Rules of 2007. Thus, the said actions of the defendant no. 2 cannot be categorized as groundless threat or what can be called as frivolous action. Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff in the present form is not maintainable as there is no groundless threat extended by the defendant no. 1 by approaching the defendant no. 2. The defendant no. 1 has rather taken the recourse to the law by approaching the custom officials who have to perform their duties as per Act. Therefore, it is not proper for the plaintiff to call the said process as groundless threat and the remedy of the plaintiff lies somewhere else but not certainly by filing the suit.  c)  Thirdly, learned counsel for the defendants have argued that the powers of the custom officials or defendant no. 2 in relation to suspension of the release of the goods on the grounds of the infringement of the patent is the mandate of the International obligations of India with WTO (World Trade Organization) regime. The TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement of 1994 mandates the member countries to make such measures. In pursuance to the same, the said measures are taken and the said rules of 2007 are framed and circular dated 29th October 2007 is issued.  In these circumstances, the defendant no. 2 is well within its powers to suspend the release of the goods on the  grounds of the infringement of the patents and the plaintiff’s submission on the ground that the defendant no. 2 is an implementing authority on the basis of the circular is incorrect as the circular only adds a note of caution which is that extreme care should be exercised while detaining the goods on the basis of the infringement of the patents. But the import of the said clause in the circular does not imply that the defendant no 2 is powerless to detain the goods. This is clearly the misreading of the circular as well as the notification. Thus, the plaintiff’s interpretation of the notification is incorrect and illegal.  d)  Fourthly, it is argued that the custom officials are empowered not merely to detain the goods on the basis of infringement of the patent but the powers are wide enough enabling the officials to go on to see whether any such imports effected will violate or contravene any law for the time being in force. This would mean that the general powers of the custom officials are wide enough to check and detain goods on any grounds and the same cannot be fettered in the manner in which the plaintiff is contending. Thus, if that is so, then, there is no reason why the same should also not hold good for patent. Further, the interpretation must be given to the Rules and the circular which would preserve such powers of the custom officials rather than to say that the custom officials are powerless to detain the goods when the powers are wide enough enabling them to do so.  e)  It is argued that the plaintiff had an efficacious alternative remedy available under Section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962 and the plaintiff could have approached the Custom Commissioners (Appeals) for redressal of its grievances.",

The reference is invited to the Supreme Court dictum of Exphar S.A & Anr v.Eupharma Laboratories Ltd , (2004) 3 SCC 688 wherein Hon’ble Justice Ruma Pal (as her lordship then was) speaking for the apex court observed as under:  “Besides when an objection to jurisdiction is raised by way of demurrer and not at the trial, the objection must proceed on the basis that the facts as pleaded by the initiator of the impugned proceedings are true. The submission in order to succeed must show that given those facts the Court does not have jurisdiction as a matter of law. In rejecting a plaint on the ground of jurisdiction, the Division Bench should have taken the allegations contained in the plaint to be correct. However, the Division Bench examined the written statement  filed by the respondents in which it was claimed that the goods were not at all sold within the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court and also that the respondent No. 2 did not carry on business within the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court. Having recorded the appellants' objections to these factual statements by the respondents, surprisingly the Division Bench said:  \"Admittedly the goods are being traded outside India and not being traded in India and as such there is no question of infringement of trademark within the territorial limits of any Court in India what to of Delhi\".  Apart from the ex-facie contradiction of this statement in the judgment itself, the Division Bench erred in going beyond the statements contained in the plaint.” (Emphasis Supplied).  From the bare reading of the afore quoted observations of the apex court in Exphar (supra), there seems to be settled position in the law that the averments made in the plaint have to be seen as a correct while testing the jurisdiction of the court and the court should proceed to return the plaint only when the court does not have the jurisdiction as a matter of the law and not when it requires an enquiry into facts.",

The learned Division Bench of this court observed:  “There is another ground for holding that the Court has jurisdiction. Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that a suit like the present can be filed wherever the cause of action wholly or partly arises. The plaintiff has prayed for an injunction regarding a threatened breach of a registered trade mark. The learned Single Judge held that the Delhi court does not have jurisdiction on the ground of any sale having been made in Delhi, but does have jurisdiction on account of the advertisement having appeared in the Trade Marks Journal. The real point which gives the Court jurisdiction is not the place where the advertisement has appeared, but the fact that the trade mark is sought for sale in Delhi amongst other places. Furthermore, when an injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the threat should have become a reality before the injunction is sought, it is not necessary that the threat should have become a reality before the injunction and it can even be sought for a threat that is still to materialise.  An injunction being prohibitive in nature is intended to prevent something that is likely to happen. Once the plaintiffs have learnt that the defendants have applied for registration of trade mark in Delhi, they can claim an injunction to prevent any sale of the infringing product in Delhi. In this sense, the Court will have jurisdiction whether any sale in Delhi has taken place or not. In any case, as already stated, the decision is of a preliminary nature, once the exact scope of what the defendants intend to do is known, it is open to the court to return the plaint. In that sense, it is not a  final decision and is not open to appeal at the preliminary stage being not a final adjudication.",

                        "content": "The said observations of the Division Bench of this court in Jawahar (Supra) make the following things clear:  a)  That the suits premised on apprehended wrong or threatened damage finds a place in the law and can be entertained by the court even if the tort itself might not have been perfected or the said threat actually does not have culminated into reality  b)  The observations of the Division Bench of this Court in Jawahar (Supra) were made again in similar circumstances wherein the objection relating to territorial jurisdiction of this court was taken as a matter of demurer and the court’s determination to return the plaint as a matter of law in the preliminary stage like in the present case was inconclusive and that is the reason why the division bench raised a note of caution that the plaint can be returned if in the later stage, it is discovered otherwise.  c)  The careful reading of the observations of the Division Bench in Jawahar(Supra) would also make it clear that when the averments made in the plaint do not ex facie make it clear that the territorial jurisdiction cannot be invoked as a matter of law, the court should not return the plaint. Then, the same very question of jurisdiction becomes a mixed question of fact and law which has to be necessary postponed till the time, the said fact is conclusively established one way or other in the trial. In the case of Jawahar (Supra) too, the court was unclear about the establishment of the fact as to whether such threat which was likely at that time would be going to be reality in the jurisdiction court or not, that is why the court said that at the preliminary stage, it is not wise to  return the plaint treating it to be mixed question of fact and law.  Now, it is to be seen as to whether the judgment of Division Bench of this court in Jawahar (Supra) holds the field or not.  The discussion relating to the same has been done in extenso by the learned Single Judge of this court (Hon’ble Badar Durrez Ahmed J) in the case of Pfizer Products, Inc (supra) wherein the learned single judge proceeded to analyze the observations of the Jawahar (Supra) alongside the recent line of authorities emanating from Supreme Court like Dhodha House &  Patel Field  Marshal Industries vs. S.K. Maingi & P.M. Diesel  Ltd., 2006 (32) PTC 1 (SC) which clearly defines what is called “carrying on business” and “part of cause of action”. The learned Single Judge after carefully analyzing the case of Jawahar (Supra) proceeded to observe that the Dhodha House (supra) and other line of authorities do not overrule expressly the decision of Jawahar (Supra) and rather Dhodha House distinguishes Jawahar on the ground that it is not applicable to Dhodha’s facts, thus, the decision of Jawahar (supra) is a good law. In the words of the learned Single Judge, it has been observed thus:  “Now, I come to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dhodha House (supra). In Dhodha House (supra), the Supreme court was concerned with two civil appeals; one in respect of Dhodha House and the other in respect of PM Diesel. In the case of Dhodha House, which came up to the Supreme Court from the Allahabad High Court, no application for registration had been filed by the defendants anywhere in India. Insofar as the case of PM Diesel Limited is concerned, the application was filed in the Trade Mark Registry at Bombay and the parties were also residents of Rajkot. That was a case which came to the Supreme Court via the Delhi High Court. In fact, before the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court three contentions as  regards the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court were raised. The first being under Section 62 of the Copyright Act, 1957 on the ground that the suit was a composite suit under the Copyright Act as well as under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The second contention being that the defendants had sought registration of the trademark at Delhi. The third contention was that the defendants were selling goods under the impugned trademark at Delhi. Insofar as the third contention was concerned, the Division Bench made no observation and the suit continues before the Delhi High court as would be apparent from a reading of paragraph 59 of the said decision. Insofar as the first question is concerned that pertains to the intricacies of a composite suit being filed under two separate causes of action and with regard to the joinder of causes of action under Order 2 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Code with which we are not concerned in the present proceedings. On the second aspect that is that the defendants had sought registration of the trade mark at Delhi, it is clear that no application had, in point of fact, been made in Delhi. The application was made in Bombay and the parties were residents of Rajkot. The Supreme Court in the case of Dhodha House (supra) held that the second contention for conferring jurisdiction on the court at Delhi was not available.  Referring to the decision of the Division bench in the case of Jawahar Engineering (supra), the Supreme Court observed as under:",

                        "content": "The said decision has no application in the instant case for more than one reason. For the purpose of registration of a trade mark, an application must be filed in the branch office of the Registrar of Trade Marks. It is not in dispute that under Section 5(3) of the 1958 Act, the Central Government has issued a notification in the Official Gazette defining the territorial limits within which an office of the Trade Marks Registry may exercise its functions. The office of the Trade Marks Registry at New Delhi exercises jurisdiction over the States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh and  National Capital Territory of Delhi. Whereas in M/s Dhodha House v S.K. Maingi, no such application has been filed, admittedly in M/s Patel Field Marshal Industries &Ors v M/s P.M. Diesels Ltd., the Delhi office has no jurisdiction as parties are residents of Rajkot and an application was filed by the Appellant for registration of its trade mark at Bombay. If an objection is to be filed, the same has to be filed at Bombay. Page 0714 An advertisement by itself in a journal or a paper would not confer jurisdiction upon a court, as would be evident from the following observations of this Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v Utpal Kumar Basu and Others : (Emphasis Supplied)  Therefore, broadly speaking, NICCO claims that a part of the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court because it became aware of the advertisement in Calcutta, it submitted its bid or tender from Calcutta and made representations demanding justice from Calcutta on learning about the rejection of its offer. The advertisement itself mentioned that the tenders should be submitted to EIL at New Delhi; that those would be scrutinised at New Delhi and that a final decision whether or not to award the contract to the tenderer would be taken at New Delhi. Of course, the execution of the contract work was to be carried out at Hazira in Gujarat. Therefore, merely because it read the advertisement at Calcutta and submitted the offer from Calcutta and made representations from Calcutta would not, in our opinion, constitute facts forming an integral part of the cause of action. So also the mere fact that it sent fax massages from Calcutta and received a reply thereto at Calcutta would not constituted an integral part of the cause of action.",

It merely said that the decision has no application in the case before it. One of the reasons granted was that the application had not been filed in Delhi. Although the Supreme Court had noted that the office of the Trade Marks Registry at New Delhi exercised jurisdiction over the States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh and National Capital Territory of Delhi, the Supreme Court categorically observed that in the case of Dhodha House no application at all had been filed whereas in the case of P.M. Diesels Ltd the Delhi office of the Registrar of Trade Marks had no jurisdiction as the parties were  residents of Rajkot and the application for registration itself had been filed at Bombay. It is in this context that the Supreme court held that the decision in Jawahar Engineering (surpa) would not be applicable to the facts of the case before it. To make it clear, since the application for registration in the two cases before it had not been made within the territory of Delhi, the Supreme court found the decision in the case of Jawahar Engineering (wherein such an application was made in Delhi) to be inapplicable to the facts of the case before it. The ratio of the Supreme Court decision in Dhodha House (supra) therefore, in my view, is not that the filing of an application at the Registrar of Trade Marks at a particular place would not clothe courts at that place with territorial jurisdiction to entertain the matter. The ratio is that an advertisement by itself in a Trade Mark Journal would not confer jurisdiction upon a court within whose territorial limits the advertisement is published or is seen. That ratio does not militate against what has been held in Jawahar Engineering (supra). Therefore, the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the defendants are not tenable and I find that the decision in the case of Jawahar Engineering (supra) covers the present case which has not been unsettled by the Supreme Court in Dhodha House(supra).” (Emphasis Supplied)",

Lahoti (as his lordship then was) observed thus:  \"A court seized of a suit and a prayer for the grant of ad interim relief may be faced with a doubt or challenge as to the availability of jurisdiction to try the suit in a variety of circumstances. The court has to act as under :-(a) In the case of inherent lack of jurisdiction apparent on the face of the record, court cannot exercise jurisdiction over the suit so as to pass any interlocutory order or grant interim relief; (b) If it appears from a bare reading of the plaint that the court does not have jurisdiction to try the suit, the plaint itself may be returned for presentation to a proper court under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC; (c) If the suit appears to be barred by any law, the plaint may be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 Civil Procedure Code ; (d) It may be a disputed question of fact or law or both-whether court has jurisdiction over the suit or not. Such a question if it be a pure question of law it can be decided on hearing the parties on a preliminary issue. Such a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the -suit being laid by the defendant as a pure question of law, it is incumbent upon the Judge to determine that question as a preliminary issue before making absolute the rule issued earlier; (e) If the determination of jurisdiction of the Court is a question of fact or mixed question of fact and law requiring evidence to be adduced before recording a finding, the determination of the question may in appropriate, cases be liable to be postponed till after the determination of all or several other issues if the evidence to be adduced by the parties may be common on the issue of jurisdiction and such other issues.\" (Emphasis Supplied)",

Following the dictum of Division Bench in State Trading Corporation (Supra), the correct recourse in such cases would be to postpone the determination of such question till the conclusion of trial as it requires determination some facts along side the application of law.

                        "content": "On the conjoint reading of the rules of 2007 read with the circular made thereunder, the following position relating to scheme of suspension of clearance of goods become clear:  a)  That the commissioner of customs is empowered to suspend the clearance of the goods on the ground when “he has a reason to believe” on the basis of the notice given by the right holder and the said suspension of the clearance of the goods based on the suspicion that the said goods are infringing the intellectual rights of the right holder. This is provided under rule 7 meaning thereby that the custom commissioner will suspend the clearance on the basis of reason to believe and suspicion of the infringement.  b)  The later part of rule 7 further mandates that the custom commissioner has to immediately inform the importer about the said suspension. Further sub rule (3) and (4) also indicates once the proprietor does not join the proceedings, the goods shall be released after the time limit fixed under sub rule (3) and rule (4) of the rules. Further sub rules (6) to (8) also provides for the similar provisions of release of goods where the right holder does not join the proceedings, the goods shall be released. All these provisions are indicators of  the scheme relating to the working of this suspension mechanism provided under the customs.  On the one hand, the custom officials are empowered to suspend the clearance basing upon their suspicion of infringement, likewise the corresponding the safeguards are provided for the importer so that there should not be any abuse of the powers and the suspended goods must be released immediately if the suspicion which formed the basis does not culminate into the conclusive reason to believe.  Only once the customs have reason to believe after their suspicion has actually become their opinion or reason to believe that the goods are infringing the intellectual property rights by exercising the enquiry on the subject suspended goods, the customs are further empowered to confiscate the goods under the sub rule 9 of the Rule 7.  For the purpose of the formation of the opinion post the suspension, the rule 5 provides only a guideline so far it relates to determination of infringement intellectual property right whereby the customs can seek assistance from the right holder technical or otherwise in order to form of his opinion as to whether the goods infringe the intellectual property rights of the holder or not. The said assistance or information or technical expertise as per the rules can be taken from the right holder by the custom for the purposes of forming their opinion. Further Rule 8 provides some light relating to such opinion formation by enabling the parties to do the examination of the suspended goods. Rule 8 thus provides that the customs shall allow a right holder and the importer or their duly authorized representatives to examine the goods, the clearance of which has been suspended, and may provide representative samples for examination, testing and analysis to assist in determining whether the goods are pirated, counterfeit or otherwise infringe an intellectual  property right, without prejudice to the protection of confidential information.  Thus, the custom officials are empowered mainly exercise their discretion to form the opinion as to infringement basing upon the version of the right holder and the importer.  There is only a limited scope of enquiry whereby the customs can either call upon the right holder to assist or the importer or the right holder to take the samples for testing and then determine. Such kind of limited scope of enquiry may be sufficient for the formation of the opinion relating to the intellectual property rights where the eye is sole arbiter or where by testing the article in the laboratory, it can be found that the said article is genuine or counterfeit or by looking into the article carefully.  The said Rules of 2007 thus provide for bare minimum provisions for determination of complex nature of intellectual property rights like patent infringement. The said rules primarily are meant for those kinds of intellectual property rights where infringement is easy to determine on the basis of the look and feel of the article where either eye is sole arbiter or where limited enquiry is required for determination. The said rules nowhere guides the custom commissioner as to how to read the specification of patent, how to arrive at the positive finding of the patent infringement and also nowhere guides the commissioner as to what he has to do once the challenge is set up against the infringement of patent claim by the importer. The said rules also overlook the participation of the civil court which has jurisdiction to determine infringement claims under the patent act. Thus, overall the said rules overlook the scheme of infringement of patents enquiry as provided under the Patent Act. All the factors are indicators to the effect that the  role of the commissioner in such cases of infringement of patent is extremely limited as no such powers are either conferred or vests in the commissioner of the customs.  The said Rules of 2007 nowhere provide the detailed mechanism of determination of complex intellectual properties issues like validity of the patent which corresponds to the mechanism provided under the Patent Act. Under the Patents Act, the jurisdiction to decide the infringement of the patent rests exclusively with the civil court and it is decided in favour of the right holder only once the patent is found to be valid one by the civil court after setting aside the challenge laid to the validity of the patent. This is due to the reason that there is no presumption of the validity of the granted patent under the law of patents unlike trade mark act or copyright act. (kindly see the judgment of  the Bishwanath Prashad Radhey Shayam Vs. Hindustan Metal Industries, AIR 1982 SC 1444 of Supreme Court where the Apex court opines so)  Thus, if the goods are suspended on the basis of the suspicion of the customs authority on the allegations of grounds of infringement of patent, the customs cannot straightway allowed to believe that the said allegations are in fact true unless the grounds of the validity of the patent are determined. This is unlike the scheme of other intellectual property rights, where the certificate of the registration shall form prima facie proof of validity.  Thus, the Rules 7 to 11 by themselves nowhere provide the mechanism for determination of the validity of the patent nor gives the ample chance to the importer to raise such grounds of the validity of the patent before the customs. This scheme under the rules as it is couched in the present form raises doubts as to how in the absence of such rules and mechanism of determination, the customs can be given such  powers of adjudication of the claims relating to patents without amendments to the Patents Act relating to the same. Thus, it raises further doubts as to how the interpretation given by the customs that they are empowered to determine the infringement of the patent after the formation of the rules is correct.  c)  The doubts which arise after reading of the rules of 2007 seem to be clarified somehow by the circular dated 29th October, 2007 by providing the note of the caution as well as some indications as how the custom authorities are allowed to act under the rules relating to infringement of patent claims. The said circular provides that while the mandatory obligations under Articles 51 to 60 of the TRIPS dealing with border measures are restricted to Copyright and Trade Marks infringement only, the said Rules deal with Patents, Designs and Geographical Indications violations as well, in conformity with the practice prevailing in some other countries, notably EU countries. While it is not difficult for Customs officers to determine Copyright and Trade Marks infringements at the border based on available data/inputs, it may not be so in the case of the other three violations, unless the offences have already been established by a judicial pronouncement in India and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order. In other words, extreme caution needs to be exercised at the time of determination of infringement of these three intellectual property rights.  The reading of the said guidelines under the circular again makes it clear that the customs are allowed to make the enquiry relating to the patent acting as an implementing authority of the orders of the civil court. However, the another sentence in the same circular provides that an extreme caution to be exercised by the customs again enables the customs to argue that such cannot be the  interpretation of the rules as this noting in the circular only acts as a note of caution nowhere eliminates or take away the powers of the customs of suspend the goods on the basis of infringement of the patent.",

The defendant no.2/customs further argue that the said rules are provided in view of the obligation of India mandated under the TRIPS Agreement. Thus, the ambiguity in the interpretation of the rules along with the circular continues to remain as circular in one sentence seems to clarify the same but in another sentence again retains the confusion intact. Thus, it has become necessary to revisit the TRIPS regime as to see what has been provided there under as a matter of practice",

                        "content": "From the collective reading of the Articles provided under the TRIPS agreement, the following aspects can be said to  have come to light relating to the scheme of border measures mandated by the TRIPS agreement:  a)  Article 51 provides for the different kind of treatment relating to border measures when it comes to trade mark, copyright infringement on the one hand vis-a-vis the infringement of the other forms of intellectual property rights. The said article 51 uses the expression “shall” making it obligatory upon the member states to provide for the procedure for the suspension of the goods on the basis of the suspicion of the right holder relating to the infringement of the trade mark or copyright pirated goods. Curiously, the same very article uses the expression “may” which making it optional for the member countries to provide such mechanism for other forms of intellectual properties with the proviso that the conditions set out in this chapter are met with.  The closer reading of the article 51 reflects the intention of the draftsmen which is that they are conscious about the nature of intellectual property rights and corresponding enforcement of the same by custom authorities as an institution. Further, the draftsmen are also conscious that the same kind of treatment cannot be accorded to trade mark, copyright, patent and all other forms of intellectual properties when it comes to border measures by empowering the custom officials in the same manner. That is the reason why, the mandate under the TRIPS is obligatory qua the trade mark and copyright infringement and optional qua the patent and other forms of intellectual property.  Furthermore, the said article 51 is also indicative of the intention of the draftsmen to provide for extra safeguards in relation to border measures in case the member countries opts to provide for the procedures relating to border measures in relation to the “other forms of intellectual  properties”. These extra safeguards are in the form of insistence that “the requirements of this section are met”. Thus, the said differential treatment under article 51 which is optional for the member state is further conditioned by the fact that the requirements of this section are to be complied with.  b)  Now the question arises what are the requirements of this section which articles 51 insist that to be satisfied. The answer can be traced by further reading the entire section especially by conjoint reading of article 53 and article 55. The said collective reading of articles make the entire scheme complete, workable and all comprehensive relating to border measures when it comes to the enforcement of the other forms of intellectual property rights.  c)  The scheme of border measures which is emerging from the collective reading of article 53 and 55 can be summarized in the following manner:    There is classification of the suspensions of the goods which can be affected by the custom officials in relation to border measures in respect of patents etc into two parts. First, is the kind of suspensions done by the custom officials on the basis of the decision of judicial authority or other independent authority and the second one is relating to the suspension of the release of the goods done by the custom authorities other than basing on the decision of the judicial authority or independent authority. The said distinction is apparent from the reading of article 53(2).    So far as it relates to suspension of the release of goods conducted other than on the basis of the decision of judicial authority or independent authority,  the treatment of such goods are conditioned by two distinct independent eventualities.  First is the case, where such goods were suspended from the release for a stipulated time period as provided under article 55 which is 10 days which is further extendable as provided within which the right holder has to inform that whether right holder or any other party other than the importer has lodged the infringement proceedings before the competent court or the proceedings before the competent authority leading to the merits of the case has been lodged and upon such information, the custom officials can review the decision of suspension.  However, if the right holder does not inform within the period provided or extended as per article 55 about the launch of infringement proceedings within the competent court or authority, then the said proceedings before the custom official shall lapse and the goods shall be released.  Second, is the case where the infringement proceedings are launched within the time provided under article 55 before the competent court and authority and thereafter, the provisional relief or interim relief or directions are given or issued to the custom officials to continue with the said suspension order until further orders. Then, the custom officials shall act accordingly, for the purposes of provisional measures, the provisions of article 55 and article 50 (6) are relevant. This is again clear by reading article 53 and 55 together.",

But that simplified process shall be only in consonance with Article 11(1) where under there is a mutual agreement between the right holder and importer to enable the customs to proceed for destruction by way of admission of rights. Thus, instead of determining the infringement, the customs can proceed to destroy the goods on the basis of admission of the rights by the importer as per Article 11 (1). The said procedure is provided under article 11 (1) where within 10 days a written agreement from declarant or the importer can be furnished wherein he can express his intention to abandon those goods and basing upon which the customs can proceed. In all other cases where there is a contest, article 13 shall apply.  b)  Under Article 13 mandates the right holder to inform the customs , “within 10 days of the suspension that the right holder has initiated the proceedings before the competent court for determination of infringement of intellectual property rights failing which the goods shall be released.  c)  The Article 14 of the said regulations deals with the suspected goods which are suspended on the basis of infringement of patents, designs rights etc shall be released provided the information about the initiation of infringement proceedings is given as per Article 13 (1) and no precautionary measures are ordered by the said competent authority and time limit prescribed under article 13 has expired.

The learned author in the said book analyses the scheme of the regime under Border Controls in relation to patent matters by identifying the participants in the regime, one of which is the patent court. The learned author observes thus:  “19.2 The regime includes various players. First, the competent custom service or authority (in the United Kingdom, the Commissioners), which may include a central administrative office and local ports offices. Secondly, there is an applicant who is the right holder, meaning the proprietor of the patent in question (or his licencee or their respective representative). Thirdly, is the person who makes the custom declaration, who is usually the importer. Fourthly, there is a consignee. Finally, there is the authority competent to determine the certain matters under the regime, whose position, existence and status is somewhat unclear. (foot note appended to this sentence provides that probably, the domestic court having jurisdiction in relation to patent disputes, see C-223/1998 in Re : Adidas, 1999 ECR I-7081) (Emphasis Supplied)",

Thus, this court took the aid of international covenant which formed the basis of the rules of 2007 in order to find out the true import of the regime under the TRIPS agreement and used it as an aid to construction of such rules.

While it is not difficult for Customs officers to determine Copyright and Trade Marks infringements at the border based on available data/inputs, it may not be so in the case of the other three violations, unless the offences have already been established by a judicial pronouncement in India and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order. In other words, extreme caution needs to be exercised at the time of determination of infringement of these three intellectual property rights”.[underlined/in bold for emphasis] 4.5 As is evident from the above wording of the Circular No. 41/2007-Customs dated 29th October, 2007, that the Circular merely seeks to drive a note of caution with regard to the determination of infringement in case of patents, designs and Geographical Indications and does not in any manner, take away the powers of Customs authorities to act on imported goods infringing Patents Act, conferred by Section 11 of Customs Act, 1962 and Notification 51/201 Customs (N.T).

                        "content": "The events pursuant to the orders passed by this court dated 30th November 2011 are highlighted as under:  a)  On 19th December 2011, this court while exercising its powers under article 226 of the Indian constitution again passed the order in the W.P.(C) 6878/2011 titled as Kingtech Electronics (India) Pvt. Ltd v. Union Of India which is in the consonance with the interpretation accorded to the rules in the order dated 30th November 2011, the said order dated 19th December, 2011 reads as under:  I have heard learned counsel for the parties on the aspect of grant of stay of the impugned communication dated 30.03.2011, whereby the Deputy Commissioner of Customs has suspended the clearance of the goods of the petitioners covered vide a Bill of Entry No. 2979282 dated 16.03.2011 by placing reliance on Rule 7 (1) (a) of the Intellectual Property Rights (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules, 2007. The said rules provides that “where the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, based on the notice given by the right holder has a reason to believe that the imported goods are suspected to be goods infringing intellectual property rights, he shall suspend the clearance of the goods.”  The Government of India being conscious of the  complexity involved in the matter and determination of competing claims of, inter alia, patent issued a circular dated 29.10.2007, wherein it was, inter alia, observed:  “While it is difficult for Customs officers to determine Copyright and Trade Marks infringements at the border based on available data/inputs, it may not be so in the case of the other three violations, unless the offences have already been established by a judicial pronouncement in India and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order. In other words, extreme caution needs to be exercised at the time of determination of infringement of these three intellectual property rights.”  The petitioner imported a consignment of mobile phone instruments which is covered by the aforesaid Bill of Entry. Respondent No. 4 objected to the said import by the petitioner on the ground of infringement of its patent by filing an application before the Commissioner of Customs. It is informed that this application runs into about 12,000 pages. Since respondent No. 4 claims to have obtained registration of patent, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs has passed the aforesaid order dated 30.03.2011.  The relevant part of this order reads as follows:  “M/s. Telefonaktiebolagat LM Ericsson [PUBL], Sweden has registered their five Intellectual Property Rights as given in Annexure I at this Commissionerate under Intellectual Property Rights (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules, 2007.  The right owner has stated that 18 models listed in Annexure-II, of G’Five brand of mobile phones infringes their intellectual property rights and has requested for the suspension of the consignments of above mentioned models of G’Five brand of phones in accordance with IPR (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules, 2007.  Since the above said consignment contains models as listed in Annexure-II, clearance of the goods is suspended in terms of Rules 7(1)(a) of the Intellectual Property Rights (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules, 2007.”  A perusal of Rule 7, as extracted above, shows that an order may be passed by the Deputy Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, only upon having a reason to believe that the imported goods are suspected to be goods infringing intellectual property rights. The impugned order, prima-facie, does not disclose on what basis the Deputy Commissioner of Customs has entertained the “reason to believe” that the goods in question infringed the patent claimed by the respondent No. 4.  Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has also placed reliance on the order dated 30.11.2011 passed in I.A. No. 19079/2011 in CS(OS) No. 2982/2011, which also deals with the aforesaid rule and notifications dated 29.10.2007. The Court in this interim order has observed:  “21. In case clause 4 of the notification dated 29.10.2007 is read in a meaningful manner, it becomes clear that as far as the case of other three violations, i.e., Patents, Design and Geographical Indications, are concerned, unless the offences have already been established by a judicial pronouncement in India, the custom department cannot take action contrary to clause 4 of the notification.",

He has drawn my attention to various provisions of the Customs Act and in particular, to Sections 104 & 105 thereof. He submits that under Section 115, the Court which is confronted with a dispute regarding patents may appoint scientific advisors.   The impugned order does not show any application of mind by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs to the claim made by respondent No. 4 with regard to the alleged infringement of its patent by the petitioner or the validity thereof. Respondent No. 4 has not approached a competent Court to assert its claim to patent and, on that basis, to seek an injunction against release of the petitioner’s consignment.  In view of the aforesaid position, I stay the operation of the impugned order. The respondents should release the consignment of the petitioner. However, the same may not be released for a period of ten days to enable the respondent No. 4 to approach the Civil Court to seek appropriate remedy.  No observation made by me in this order shall prejudice the case of either party before the Civil Court.  The application stands disposed of.  Counter-affidavit be filed by the respondent authorities within four weeks. Rejoinder thereto, if any, be filed before the next date.  List on 06.03.2012.

FAO(OS)  63/2012  wherein the Division Bench passed the order that the defendant did not wish the press the appeal. Thus, the order dated 30th November 2011 was thus affirmed by the Division Bench though it was an ex-parte order.  c)  When both these orders of the learned single judges of this court were in force and Division Bench order dated 8th February 2012 was also in force, in the teeth of these orders, the circular dated 27th March 2012 is surfaced into the picture giving its own interpretation to the provisions of Customs Act, rules and earlier circular dated 29.10.2007 clarifying the position totally contrary to what has been stated by the learned single judges of this court.",

This edifice was built on two pillars. Provisions of the Patents Act were relied upon to impress that registration of patent per se does not lead to any presumption of its validity inasmuch as whenever suit for injunction is filed by the patent  holder on the basis of such registration, the defendant can always set up a defence that registration was not valid and it is for the Civil Court to go into this aspect without seeking cancellation of the registered patent from the registering authorities. It is submitted that such mechanism was not available with the customs authorities and therefore, they were incompetent to arrive at any such conclusion and could not act only on the basis that there was valid registration in favour of the patent holder.",

Commissioner of Customs had no authority to pass order of suspension of clearance of its goods. In support of this argument, respondent no.4 and 5 had relied upon Circular No.41/2007 dated 29.10.2007 issued by the Government of India which inter alia reads as under:- “4. It is pertinent to mention that while the mandatory obligations under Articles 51 to 60 of the TRIPS dealing with border measures are restricted to Copyright and Trade Marks infringement only, the said Rules deal with Patents, Designs and Geographical indications violations as well, in conformity with the practice prevailing in some other countries, notably EU countries. While it is not difficult for Customs officers to determine Copyright and Trade Marks infringements at the border based on available data/inputs, it may not be so in the case of the other three violations, unless the offences have  already been established by a judicial pronouncements in India and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order. In other words, extreme caution needs to be exercised at the time of determination of infringement of these three intellectual property rights.”  In nut shell, case of the respondents no.4 and 5 in the said petition, as well as before us, was/is that unless there is a judicial pronouncement in favour of the such an intellectual property right holder, there cannot be any suspension of clearance  of imported goods.",

Thus, each form of the intellectual property whether it be Copy Right, Trade Mark, Patent Designs Act and Geographical  once under these Rules power was given to the Dy. Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, to suspend the clearance of goods based on notice given by the right holder after forming an opinion that he had “reason to believe”  that imported goods are suspected to be infringing intellectual property rights, the competent authority had adequate jurisdiction to exercise power and this exercise is not dependent upon an injunction order of the civil court. His submission was that the respondents no.4 and 5  in their  writ petition had not challenged the validity of these Rules and, therefore, the Rules were to be given their full effect as they exist. Attention was drawn to the following judgment in this behalf:  “13. The factual basis in all these appeals is identical. The facts clearly show that in every case the pay-fixation of the junior was done under the Fundamental Rules and there were justifiable reasons for fixing the junior at a higher pay then his seniors in the cadre. It was not disputed that the said pay fixation was in conformity with the Fundamental Rules Neither before us nor before the courts below the validity of Fundamental Rules was challenged by any of the parties. Without considering the scope of these Rules and without adverting to the reasons for fixing the juniors at a higher pay, the High Court and the Tribunal have in an omnibus manner come to the conclusion that whenever and for whatever reasons' a junior is given higher pay the doctrine of 'equal pay for equal work' is violated and the seniors are entitled to the same pay.”",

It is pertinent to note that this position, viz. the validity of a patent is not guaranteed by the grant, is now expressly provided in Section (<javascript:fnOpenGlobalPopUp('/ba/disp.asp','24819','1');>)13(4) of the Patents Act, 1970. In the light of this principle, Mr. Mehta's argument that there is a presumption in favour of the validity of the patent, cannot be accepted”  He thus submitted that there was no presumption to the validity of the patent even after registration which still has to be suspended independently and that can only be done in Civil Court. He contrasted the provisions of Section 104 of the Patent Act read with Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act which provision raises presumption about the validity of a registered trademark. His further submission was that before there could be suspension  of the clearance of the imported goods on the ground that they are violating the patent rights of the right holder, two issues need to be addressed namely;  (a)  Grant is valid  (b) Imported goods infringed that patent.  On the first aspect, he argued that validity of the grant cannot be adjudicated upon by the Dy.

In this behalf he tried to impress that in the instant case itself the appellant had placed on record 12000 pages to establish its patent rights, there was no mechanism with the Dy. Commissioner of Customs to examine the issue that patent was rightly registered and to compare it with so called infringing goods of the respondent and record “reason to believe” that there was such infringement. He argued that as per the scheme under the Patents Act, such an exercise could only be taken by the Civil Court. Conscious of this fact, the Central Government had issued Notification dated 29.10.2007.

Suspension of  clearance of imported goods.- (1) (a) Where the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, based on the notice given by the right holder has a reason to believe that the imported goods are suspected to be goods infringing intellectual property rights, he shall suspend the clearance of the goods.  (b) The Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, may, on his own initiative, suspend the clearance of goods , in respect of which he has prima-facie evidence or reasonable grounds to believe that the imported goods are goods infringing intellectual property rights.  (2)  The Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, shall immediately inform the importer and the right holder or their respective authorised  representatives through a letter issued by speed post or through electronic mode of the suspension of clearance of the goods and shall state the reasons for such suspension.  (3)  Where clearance of the goods suspected to be infringing intellectual property has been suspended and the right holder or his authorised representative does not join the proceedings within a period of ten working days from the date of suspension of clearance leading to a decision on the merits of the case, the goods shall be released provided that all other conditions of import of such goods under the Customs Act, 1962, have been complied with:  Provided that the above time-limit of ten working days may be extended by another ten days in appropriate cases by the Commissioner or an officer authorized by him in this behalf.  (4)  Where the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, has suspended clearance of goods on his own initiative and right holder does not give notice under rule 3 of the Rules or does not fulfill the obligation under Rule 5, within five days from the date of suspension of clearance, the goods shall be released provided that all other conditions of import of such goods under the Customs Act, 1962, have been complied with.  (5)  Where the clearance of goods has been suspended, customs may, where it acts on its own initiative, seek from the right holder any information or assistance, including technical expertise and facilities for the purpose of determining whether the suspect goods are counterfeit or pirated or otherwise infringe an intellectual property right.  (6)  Where the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs, as the case may be, has suspended clearance of goods on his own initiative and right holder has given notice under rule 3 of the Rules and fulfilled the obligations under Rule 5, but , the right holder or his authorised representative does not join the proceedings within a period of ten working days from the date of suspension of clearance leading to a decision on the merits of the case, the goods shall be released provided that all other conditions of their import under the Customs Act, 1962, have been complied with:  Provided that the above time-limit of ten working days may be extended by another ten working days in appropriate cases by the Commissioner or an officer authorized by him in this behalf.  (7)  In the case of perishable goods suspected of infringing intellectual property rights, the period of suspension of release shall be three working days which may be extended by another four days subject to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or the officer authorized by him in this behalf that such extension shall not affect the goods.  (8)  Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules, in the case of suspension of clearance of perishable goods on the basis of notice of the right holder or his authorized representative, the right holder or his authorized representative shall join the proceedings as required under these Rules within three working days or the extended period as provided in sub-rule (7) and in case of suspension of clearance of perishable good by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs,  as the case may be, on his own initiative, the right holder shall give notice, execute a bond and join the proceedings as required under these Rules within three working days or the extended period as provided in sub-rule (7) , as the case may be, failing which the goods shall be released.  (9)  If within ten working days or the extended period under sub-rule (6), as the case may be, and within three working days or the extended period as provided in sub-rule (7) of this rule in the case of perishable goods, the right-holder or his authorized representative joins the proceedings, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, having reasons to believe that the goods are goods infringing intellectual property rights and liable to confiscation under section 111 (d) of the Customs Act, may seize the same under section 110 of the Customs Act.  suspension of clearance leading to a decision on the merits of the case. LPA 1104/2011 Page 17 of 26 20. The order was passed under Rule 7 (1)(a) of the IPR Rules. This order could be passed on the satisfaction that the competent authority had „reason to believe‟ that the imported goods are suspected to be the goods infringing the intellectual property rights. After going through the complete text of Rule 7 of IPR Rules, it becomes clear that such an order for suspension of clearance of goods can been passed on the aforesaid belief either on the notes given by the right holder of the intellectual property rights or even by his own initiative. After the passing of the order of suspension the importer is to be informed about the suspension order stating the reasons for such suspension. Thereafter, in further proceedings the right holder has to join within a period of 10 working days from the date of  Merit of the case means that thereafter adjudication has to take place by the appropriate authority as to whether the goods imported in fact infringes the intellectual property rights of the right holder. While doing this exercise the appropriate authority can seek any information or assistance from the right holder including technical expertise and facilities for the purpose of determining whether the suspect goods are counterfeit or pirated or otherwise infringe an intellectual property right. There is a specific clause stipulating time bound period to determine this question in case of perishable goods. If ultimately the authority determines, having reason to believe that the goods are infringing intellectual property rights and liable to confiscation under Section 111(d) of the Customs Act, it may pass the orders seizing the same under Section 110 of the Customs Act, as per the provision of Rule 7 (a) of the IPR Rules.  clearance are infringing goods, the same can be disposed of in accordance LPA 1104/2011 Page 18 of 26 21. Before such a final order is passed, right is given for examination of these goods by right holder under Rule 8 of the IPR Rules. For this purpose, the competent authority is authorized to examine the goods, the clearance of which has been suspended, and may provide representative samples for examination, testing and analysis to assist in determining whether the goods are pirated, counterfeit or otherwise infringe an intellectual property right, without prejudice to the protection of confidential information. The right holder is also entitled to seek additional relevant information relating to the consignment which has been suspended for clearance as per the provisions of Rule 9 of the IPR Rules. The additional relevant information relating to consignment which has been suspended for clearance is also to be supplied to the importer. Once it is determined that the goods suspended from  with the provisions of Rule 11 of the IPR Rules which reads as under:- “11.Disposal of infringing goods. -(1). Where upon determination by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, it is found that the goods detained or seized have infringed intellectual property rights, and have been confiscated under section 111 (d) of the Customs Act, 1962 and no legal proceedings are pending in relation to such determination, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, shall, destroy the goods under official supervision or dispose them outside the normal channels of commerce after obtaining 'no objection' or concurrence of the right holder or his authorized representative:  Provided that if the right holder or his authorized representative does not oppose or react to the mode of disposal as proposed by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, within twenty working days after having been informed, or within such extended period as may have been granted by the Commissioner at the request of the right holder, not exceeding another twenty working days, he shall be deemed to have concurred with the mode of disposal as proposed by the Deputy Commissioner of Customs or Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be:  Provided further that the costs toward destruction, demurrage and detention charges incurred till the time of destruction or disposal, as the case may be, shall be borne by the right holder.  (2)  There shall not be allowed the re-exportation of the goods infringing intellectual property rights in an unaltered state.  (3)  The Deputy Commissioner of Customs or  Assistant Commissioner of Customs , as the case may be, may on his own, or at the request of the right holder, retain samples of goods infringing intellectual property rights prior to their destruction or disposal and provide the same to the right holder or importer if such samples are needed as evidence in pending or future litigations.”",

                        "content": "Undoubtedly, as per definition of “intellectual property” given in Rule 2(b) of the IPR Rules, patent as defined in the Patents Act, 1970 is also included as the intellectual property. Likewise, “right holder” is the person who is the owner of protected intellectual property right. The IPR Rules, 2007, therefore, applies to all kinds of intellectual properties namely Copyright, Trade Marks , Patents as well as geographical indications. These Rules do not put Trade Marks and Copyright in one category and Patents and geographical indications in other category. Thus, a patentee, who is registered patent holder, has right to get himself registered under these Rules. In these circumstances, if the conditions contained in Rule 7 of the IPR Rules are satisfied, the authority mentioned in those Rules has adequate jurisdiction to exercise power to suspend the clearance of goods even in respect of those cases where the goods inspected are, in the opinion of the competent authority, suspected to be goods infringing the patent right of the patentee. Notwithstanding the aforesaid plain reading of the Rule, the problem has arisen because of the complexities involved in the nature of  the patent rights even when the right holder is having a patent which is duly registered under the Act. It is correct that even in such a situation, in a suit infringement of patent, the defendant can raise a counter claim for revocation of a patent and in these circumstances, when such a counter claim is made the matter is to be dealt with by the High Court alone for adjudication/decision. As per Section 13(4) of the Act, the validity of a patent not guaranteed by the grant and there is no presumption in favour of the validity of the patent.

                        "content": "So far so good. However, what follows from the aforesaid is that when a patent holder files a suit for infringement, the defendant is given right to contend that such a grant was not warranted and that should be revoked. When a counter claim for revocation of patent is made the Court is to look into the same and this aspect would be considered while deciding the suit for infringement of patent filed by the patent holder and also while deciding the application for injunction. At this stage, the question which would fall for consideration would be as to whether it is necessary that this aspect is to be considered only by the Court through judicial pronouncements? To put it otherwise, whether the competent authority under the IPR Rules, 2007 is not competent to go into this question and, therefore, it is debarred from passing any order of suspension of clearance of goods sought to be imported merely because the case relates to the patent?  As pointed out above, insofar as plain reading of IPR Rule is concerned, it is not the position. The competent authority is given right to form an opinion that he has „reason to believe‟ that the imported goods are suspected to be  infringing the intellectual property rights which include patent right as well. These Rules have not been challenged by the respondent though such a right is reserved in the writ petition filed by the respondent in which impugned order is passed. Even Mr. Chandra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent no.4 itself conceded that there may be clear cut patent violation cases and in those simple matters the competent authority could pass the orders. However the poser would be, how to decide the case whether the case is simple or complex. Secondly, in any case, it is the competent authority who has to arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves complexities and, therefore, exercising extreme caution, the competent authority may pass appropriate orders that it is not possible to arrive at “reasons to believe”. We are of the opinion that the discretion is to be left with the authority under Rule 7 to relegate the parties to civil proceedings. Per se, the patent cases cannot be excluded from the ambit of IPR Rules or particularly Rule 7.",

This clause states that mandatory obligations under Articles 51 to 60 of the TRIPS dealing with the border measures are restricted to Copyright and Trade Marks infringement only. However, it also recognizes that notwithstanding this position insofar as IPR Rules are concerned they deal with the Patents, Design and Geographical Indications violations as well, which have been framed in conformity with the practice prevailing in some countries, notably EU countries. Thus, in the opening portion of clause 4, there is a recognition to the effect that the Rules also deal with the patents violations as well. In the later portion, however, it is recognized that though  for a Custom Officer determining the Copyright and Trade Marks infringements may not be difficult based  on available data/inputs, it may not be that easy in case of other three violations including Patent, unless the offences have already been established by a judicial pronouncement in India and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order. However, at the end what is mentioned is that the Custom Officers has to exercise extreme caution “at the time of determination of infringement of these three intellectual property rights”. Thus, no doubt, it is emphasized that the case of patent violation may pose problem for Custom Officers and unless the offence has already been established by the judicial pronouncements and the Customs is called upon or required to merely implement such order, it would not pose any difficulty. Otherwise, there may be difficulties and in the absence of judicial pronouncement, extreme caution is to be exercised at the time of determination of infringement of such a right. It clearly follows therefrom that power of determination is not taken away from the Custom Officers in case of violation of patent right and even when there is no judicial pronouncements. The Custom Officer is asked to exercise extreme caution.",

The determination of infringement may not be easy for the Custom Officers;  (b) When there is already a judicial pronouncement determining the violation, the custom would be required to implement such an order and that position may not pose problem;  (c)  However, in the absence of such a determination, the competent authority is advised to exercise extreme caution.  What follows is that in the absence of judicial pronouncement, in the case of patent violation, the determination is to be done by the authority stipulated in Rule 7 though with extreme caution. What can be deduced therefrom that while exercising this extreme caution, the competent authority would in a simple case of violation may determine whether there is a violation or not and pass necessary orders under Rule 7 and other IPR Rules. However, in case the competent authority is of the opinion that the case involves serious complexity and such a determination as to whether there is an infringement or not, is not possible, the competent authority has the discretion to relegate the parties to civil proceedings. This according to us is the interpretation which is to be given to the Rules read with the aforesaid Notification dated 29.10.2007. Otherwise, the said Notification cannot be read in the manner which totally annihilates or supplant a particular provision of the Rules, as rightly contended by Mr. Bhushan. We thus do not agree with the view of the learned Single Judge that in the absence of judicial order, the Dy. Commissioner of Customs had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. In fact if it is incumbent for the patentee to just approach the Court and obtain a judicial order, there is no need to invoke the machinery under these rules as the purpose of the patentee would be served by getting that judicial order enforced.",

However, prima facie in view of the statement made in the plaint, the objection raised is not sustainable as in the case of Girdhari Lal Gupta v.  M/s K. Gian Chand Jain & Co., Delhi-6; AIR 1978 Delhi 146, it was observed as under:  “14. Just as there are two kinds of legal injury that may be caused by the static and dynamic effects of registration, former confined to the place of registration and the latter extending beyond it, similarly, a person interested may fall into either of two categories. Firstly,  a person interested may be aggrieved by a legal injury to his own interest in property, business, reputation, etc. He is thus a person aggrieved and as such has locus standi to make the application. The place where the injury occurs is the place where his interest has been adversely affected. The cause of action, therefore, arises at the place where the legal injury to his existing private interest has occurred. As already stated above, if a person merely intends in future to use such a design then no present interest of such a person is injured and, therefore, the only injury of which he can complain is that his future activity is prevented by the existence of the registration. That cause of action will relate to the place of the registration. The expression \"person interested\" is quite common in legislative drafting. For instance, it is used in S. 18(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Its purpose is to confine the competence to make an application to a person who has his own interest to be served by such application, It intends to exclude a mere busy body from making such an application though none of his interests has been affected. In other words, a person interested is a person aggrieved by the existing situation or by the cause of action.",

                        "content": "In Association of Data Processing Service Orgn. v. William B. Camp, (1970) 397 U. S. 150, and Clemon Barlow v. B. L. Collins, (1970) 397 US 159, the question sharply arose as to what precisely should constitute the standing of a plaintiff as distinct from the reviewability of the dispute by the court and the merits of the dispute. Justice William Dauglas speaking for the majority expressed the view that not only the competence of the plaintiff to file the suit on the allegation that the has suffered a legal injury in fact, but also the question whether the interest sought to be protected by him by way of the suit is within the range of legally protected interests together formed the locus  standi of the plaintiff. Justice Brennan, with whom Justice White joined, expressed the minority view that the allegation of legal injury by the plaintiff was sufficient to confer standing on him and to make him a person interested in filing the suit. The question whether the interest sought for by him was legally protected interest was a part of the merits of the ease or may be a part of the reviewability of the question raised by the plaintiff, but was no part of the plaintiff's capacity to sue. Fortunately in the present case, we are not concerned with the question whether standing includes merely capacity to sue or whether it includes a legal right or a part of the legal right to sue. Under S. 51-A if the petitioner is a mere pro bono publico, he would have to make the application in that High Court within the local limits of which the registration enures and continues attacking it on one of the grounds specified in S. 51-A. But, if the petitioner is a person whose private commercial interests are injured, then the place where the commercial interests are injured is included in the requirement of S. 51-A that the application can be made only by the person interested. A part of the cause of action or the subject-matter is, therefore, situated in Delhi. The application under S. 51-A can, therefore, be made at Delhi or at Calcutta, but in no other High Court.",

                        "content": "The registration of the design and its continuance in the Register of Designs is only a part of the subject-matter. What the respondents complain is not merely of the registration. They rather complain of the impact or the effect of the registration which extends far beyond the place where the Register of Designs is kept. The effect of the registration of the design under the Act is to confer a copy right in the design on the appellant. This copyright prevents the respondents from using the same design so long as the registration subsists in favor of the appellant. The copyright effect of the registration is felt in Delhi and would be felt at any place where it prevents  In Workmen of Shri Rangavilas Motors (P)  Ltd. v. Shri Rangavilas Motors (P) Ltd.,  competitors of the appellant from using the registered design for their own purpose. Viewed in this way a part of the subject-matter of the application under S. 51-A would be seen to be at Delhi where the alleged legal injury and the damage in fact is said to have been suffered by the respondents though the rest of it may be at Calcutta where the entry in the Register of Designs rests. It is not only the static entry in the Register of Designs, but also the dynamic effect of the copyright all over the country, which causes injury to the competitors of the appellant. These injured persons would have the right to make the application to the High Court having jurisdiction over the place in which this injury has occurred. AIR 1967 SC 1040 (supra), the order was passed at the Head Office of the company at Krishnagiri. It was that order which was the injury done to the workmen. It was, therefore, argued that the nexus of the subject-matter to the appropriate Government was between Krishnagiri which was in the State of Tamil Nadu and the Govt. of Tamil Nadu at Madras which had the jurisdiction over Krishnagiri, But, the Supreme Court repelled this argument with the statement that \"but the order was to operate on a workman working in Bangalore.\" By that observation the Supreme Court held the subject-matter to be at Bangalore and not at Krishnagiri. The nexus, therefore, was with the appropriate Government, viz., the Government of Mysore.”",
