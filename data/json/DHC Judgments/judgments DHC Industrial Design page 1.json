                        "content": "The two plaintiffs filed a suit for permanent injunction against the defendants under Section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000 read with Section 55 of the Copyright Act, 1957. The first plaintiff (hereafter “Dart”) is a Delaware, USA incorporated company; the second plaintiff, i.e., M/s. Tupperware India Pvt. Ltd. (hereafter “TIPL”) is an Indian company. Dart claims ownership and possession to the proprietary know-how, innovative  technology, intellectual property rights and trade secrets in creating the designs used for the manufacture of its products commonly known as Tupperware products. These products-so the suit says-are the result of artistic work in the form of product drawings, mould drawings and moulds over which copyright is claimed. Dart contractually granted to TIPL the right to use its moulds to manufacture Tupperware products and the right to use and apply the proprietary and registered designs in respect of those products for manufacture and offer for sale in India. Dart alleges that it has registered the proprietary designs in relation to the Tupperware products globally and in India as well. As the designs of these products are new and original, they have become extremely popular in the Indian market and have acquired tremendous goodwill and reputation. The extensive and longstanding use, reliability, high quality and wide publicity of the Tupperware products, has resulted in TIPL‟s substantial goodwill and reputation in India for the Tupperware products so much so that these products are identified by the customers by their respective design(s) and for being innovative and high quality products. The plaintiffs also claim that these products have won several design awards the world over. The Guinness Book has listed Tupperware products amongst ten greatest inventions of the 20th century. It is one of the seven US companies to recently receive the '2004 Good Buy Award' for its 'Stuffable Storage Containers' which is an award given by the Good Housekeeping Institute in USA. Details of awards won by the plaintiff over the years are furnished along with the plaint. The plaintiffs have also filed various newspaper and magazine clippings to show the goodwill and reputation which Tupperware products enjoy.",

This is an undisputed fact. The suit alleged that the defendants copied the plaintiff's design for their products i.e. food grade plastic storage containers and infringed the plaintiff's designs in these products. The defendants‟ infringing products‟ designs are identical to the designs of the plaintiffs‟ products. Such infringement entitles the plaintiffs to seek restraint of the defendants from manufacturing and marketing these products. These actions of the defendants amount to: (a) design infringement under Section 20 of the Designs Act; (b) copyright infringement under Section 55 of the Copyright Act; (c) defendants are passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs by copying trade address and trade name etc. which is confusing and similar to that of the plaintiffs goods. Therefore passing off action in injunction is also maintainable; (d) The defendants have copied the designs by adopting reverse engineering methodology; (e) the impugned act of the defendants also amounts to unfair competition and unfair trade practices which also entitles the plaintiffs to claim injunction against the defendants. The  plaintiffs described 12infringing articles of the defendants; description of these articles is set out in Para 6 of the impugned judgment.",

They visited the premises and submitted their reports after preparing inventories. The first four defendants filed a common written statement. The eighth and ninth defendants filed separate written statements. The written statements filed on behalf of the first four defendants urged several preliminary objections. One, that the suit filed by the plaintiff under Section 22 of the Design Act is not maintainable and 12 designs in question were previously published; thus neither new nor original. It was also urged that the first defendant is the sole proprietorship firm of fourth defendant; the second, third and fifth defendants had nothing to do with the suit. The sixth defendant too had nothing to do with the business of the first defendant and was only purchasing the material from the first and fourth defendants. The locus standi of TIPL to file the suit is also challenged on the ground that registration of the designs is in favor of Dart. TIPL was not a licensee to use these designs in India. The territorial jurisdiction of this Court to entertain and try the suit was challenged. The maintainability of the suit under Section 55 of the Copyright Act was challenged stating that the plaintiff has made the disclaimer vis-à-vis the copyright while obtaining the design registrations. It was also alleged by the defendants that there was no trademark or copyright infringement and there is no question of any confusion. It is also contended that passing off action under the Design Act is not even maintainable.",

The products and mark are distinct and have been marketed in cardboard packing material. TIPL,  however sells its products in loose form. The written statement urged that there was a lot of difference between the two trade-marks namely 'Tupperware' of the plaintiff and 'Signoraware' of the defendants and, therefore, question of confusion and deception does not arise. The first four defendants manufacture the products in colours, which were never used by TIPL in India. The designs in question are in public domain and the first and fourth defendants prepared them with their own skill and labour and are entitled to do so. They gave their explanation how each design is in the public domain. The eighth defendant stated that he is neither a distributor/stockist nor in any way connected with Techno Plast (first defendant) or its trade; rather it is a company formed with the main objective of dealing in Medical and Pharmaceutical products and has nothing to do with the sale of the goods in question. The ninth defendant took an identical plea.  Impugned judgment",

                        "content": "As to design infringement, the single judge noticed previous decisions  of this court and various other courts, on the meaning of “publication”1 and concluded that it meant, contextually, the availability of knowledge or awareness about a particular design in relation to specific articles or products. If such information was available in the public domain that designs were registered in favour of an applicant (here, Dart) it did not strengthen its case, because registration was only prima facie evidence of novelty and originality, the essential requirements of design protection in law. In sum, the learned single judge ruled that the materials to destroy novelty and to say that the designs were previously published were contained in the book revised new edition (C) 1989 \"The Tupperware Cook\". The single judge then stated that at the stage of granting or refusing temporary injunction, the court has to assess the prima facie strengths of the parties. The Court took note of an earlier decision, Ravinder Kumar Gupta v. Sh. Ravi Raj Gupta and Ors.2 that “......The Court has to consider and look at the designs in question with an instructed eye and say whether there is or is not such a substantial difference between that which had been published previously and the registered design as to enable the proprietor of the registered design to say that at the date of registration that was a new or original design and, therefore, properly registered.”  1Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd. v. Airfix Ltd.1 , Hills v Evans1862 LJ (Ch) 457; Gopal Glass Works Limited v. Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs &Ors and 12006 (33) PTC 434 were relied on and cited by the Single judge to determine what kind of publication was necessary to undermine novelty. The Single judge relied on Gopal Glass where it was stated that: “When the novelty of an article is tested against a prior published document, the main factor required to be adjudged is the visual effect and the appeal of the picture illustration….If the visual effect of the pattern, the shape or the combination of the pattern, shape, dimension, colourscheme, if any, are not clear from the picture illustrations, the novelty cannot be said to have been destroyed by prior publication, unless there are clear and unmistakable directions to make an article which is the same or similar enough to the impugned design.”  21986 PTC 50,  The single judge also relied on B. Chawla & Sons v. Bright Auto Industries3 , where it was held that there were only little variations in the products already existing and that adding a curve here or there in shape which is well recognized shape of an article of common use in the market cannot make it an article new or original in design. Such a claim was devoid of newness and equally devoid of originality. In the light of all these prima facie findings and observations, it was held by the single judge that the designs lacked originality and the plaintiffs were not entitled to temporary injunction on the ground of infringement of design copyright.",

                        "content": "The copyright infringement claim of the plaintiff was based on the plea that there existed copyright in the drawings, because they were a product of considerable skill and expense, spent by Darts‟ experts. The claim here was that the drawings were “artistic works” under Section 2(c)(i) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Each mould – created with such drawings cost approximately US $ 200,000 to US$ 1,000,000 (approximately equivalent to Rs. 88 lakhs to Rs. 4.4 crores) and has a life of 30 years. Since these works were created during the course of the employment of such experts with Dart, by reason of Section 17 of the said Act, it became copyright owner of the artistic works. The plaintiffs relied on Sections 13 and 14 of the Copyright to say that the bundle of rights flowing from these entitled them to exclusive rights and that the drawings of moulds also gave them right over 3D and 2D objects and articles; the defendants used such objects and with computer aided programs, were able to misuse the drawings.",

                        "content": "The impugned judgment rejected copyright claims, stating colour and colour combination by virtue of Copyright Act, cannot result in exclusivity under the law and the case of alleged infringement of copyright under  Section 45 of the Act is not maintainable. It was also observed that the copyright claimed by the plaintiffs ceased to exist under Section 15 of the Copyright Act. Samsonite Corporation v. Vijay Sales4 was relied on for purpose. It was stated that the drawings in question were prepared by the plaintiffs for the purpose of creating designs for the products to be launched, as alleged in the suit. Description of various processes -from conceptualization of idea, creation of drawings, and moulds, leading to the manufacture of the product was for the purpose of product creation. Microfibres Inc. v. Girdhar & Co. &Ors5 , Polymer Papers Ltd. v. Gurmit Singh and Ors6 and Samsonite Corporation v. Vijay Sales (supra) were followed and applied. The single judge held that since industrial drawings and designs were for the purposes of manufacturing of filter related machines or components and as such clearly fell within the meaning of design -defined in the Designs Act. The court held that the claim of copyright in the industrial drawings and designs, which were being used for manufacturing purposes, is not maintainable. The plaintiff‟s argument that Tupperware Products were “reverse engineered” by using its drawings with computer techniques possibly by 2D or 3D scanning was held to be something that required evidence. However, prima facie, the court held that that once drawings were made for creating the ultimate product design, the copyright in the said drawings cannot be claimed under the Copyright Act. It was observed that Section 15 of the Copyright Act provides that once a design is registered under the Designs Act, copyright therein shall not subsist. Such a copyright in any design ceases even when any article to which the design has been applied has been reproduced more than 50 times  3AIR1981Delhi95  41998 (18) PTC 372  5128 (2006) DLT 238  62002 (25) PTC 327 (Del.)  by an industrial process by the owner of the copyright. The underlying message is that the Designs Act governs copyright in an industrial design. If a design is registered under that Act it is not entitled for protection under the Copyright Act. Warner Brothers v. Roadrunner7 was cited and relied on. However, the court felt that since there were serious disputes which needed evidence before the plaintiff could establish copyright infringement by showing that its copyright survived despite design copyright registration and also show that such copyright had tremendous reputation, it would not be safe to injunct the defendants.",

                        "content": "The single judge considered the allegation of passing off, which was based on claim of visual similarity and likelihood of confusion. The impugned judgment states that the plaintiff‟s representative noticed that women who were visiting the defendants‟ stall in an exhibition were getting confused as to whether the products on display were the products of Tupperware and whether the said products were an imitation. Noting that in a report, the plaintiff admitted that the salesman was asserting that their products, namely Signoraware Products though were a look alike of Tupperware Products, they were being sold at half the price of Tupperware Products. Thus, the representation held out by the defendant was not that the goods were Tupperware Products. On the contrary, representation was that they were the products of a different manufacturer namely Signoraware Products and were being sold at half the price of Tupperware Products though they were look alike of Tupperware Products. Thus, in terms of this statement by the plaintiff, the defendants were not passing off their goods as that of Tupperware Products. The representation was that though they were similar to Tupperware, they were also cheap. This representation about half  the price of the Tupperware Products meant that the defendants were making it clear that though the products were not Tupperware Products but they were equally good and were sold at half the price of Tupperware Products. The single judge also observed prima facie that the defendants were, at the most, puffing up their product by alleging that they were of the same quality as Tupperware Products and selling at half the rates but had not created or tried to create any confusion. Rather, they were selling their own product, represented to be as good as that of plaintiffs‟ products. The question of passing off, therefore, did not arise. In Microfibres Inc. v. Girdhar & Co. and Ors. (supra), the Court denied injunction, inter alia, on the ground that the two products were sold under a totally different trade name. For these reasons, it was held that prima facie, there was no confusion and the claim for passing off, was not strong.  71988 FSR 292  Submissions by parties",

In the case of Tupperware products, the goods sold are known for their uniqueness and novelty, the world over. The shapes and functional features of the products, were unique; even the overall get up-including the colour combinations used for each article, have independent design and trade dress appeal. Emphasizing that the court should be careful in analyzing the passing off claim, it was submitted that a plain comparison of the plaintiffs‟ Tupperware goods and products with that of the Defendants‟ goods and articles would bring home the proof that the defendants were copying the plaintiff‟s designs; they showed visual similarity and likeness to the plaintiff‟s Tupperware goods. Learned counsel relied on Lakshmikant Patel v Chetanbhai Shah10 where it was held that:  \"8. It is common in the trade and business for a trader or a businessman to adopt a name and/or mark under which he would carry on his trade or business. According to Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 12th Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading business or any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill that the Courts will protect. An action for passing off will then lie wherever the defendant-company‟s name, or its intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the proceedings; the Court will have regard to the way in which the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the proceedings. Where there is probability of confusion in business, an injunction will be granted even though the defendants adopted the name innocently.",

The law does not permit any one to carry on his business in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients in believing that the goods or services belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name in connection with his business or services which already belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers and clients of some one else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.\"",

It was submitted  in this context that the Trademarks Act recognizes that shapes are capable of protection and are included in the expression “trade-mark”.12 He relied on the decision of the Bombay High Court in GorbatschowWodka KG 13 . Counsel highlighted the test indicated by the Court in that case, which is extracted below:  11 2000 PTC 83  “The test is whether the shape that has been adopted by the Plaintiff is one that is adopted capriciously, purely to give the article a distinctive appearance or characteristic of the goods of the manufacturer. If that be so, the manufacturer may be able to establish that he has a reputation and goodwill in the distinctive appearance of the article itself which would furnish a cause of action in passing off.”  The appellant/plaintiffs also submit that conscious deception and striking resemblance in shape, configuration and pattern of the Infringing Products to the Tupperware Products is evident from a first glance at the infringing products without going into the minute details of size, capacity, design, material used, colour combinations, product finish and the logos and trade names. Several cases are cited in support of the contention that colour combinations, shape and colour etc are important source identifiers which cannot be appropriated by a rival trader, without legal consequences. 14",

The decision is in error, in concluding that only if 'product drawings' were intended for manufacture, as against the  purpose of keeping the artistic quality of the said drawings, then such 'product drawings' would not qualify as 'artistic work' under Section 2(c)(i) of the Copyright Act,1957. It is contended that the decision in Samosonite Corporation was wrongly relied on. It is emphasized that the Division Bench judgment in Micro FibreInc vs Girdhar & Co15 holds that original paintings/works which may be used to industrially produce the designed article would continue to fall within the meaning of „artistic work' defined under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act and would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection as evident from the definition of 'design' under Section 2(d) of the Designs Act. It is further submitted that moulds are 'engravings' covered within the definition of 'artistic works' under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act and that under Section 14 (c) of the Copyright Act, the Appellants have exclusive rights to reproduce the artistic work in any material form. The impugned judgment erred in not considering that the Appellants copyright in the 'moulds' and in the 'drawings' has been infringed by the defendants as they have, by a reverse process of preparing drawings from the plaintiffs products and moulds therefrom, infringed copyright twice, once in the 'drawings' and again in the 'moulds'.

These vested Dart with copyright in the said designs by virtue of Section 11 of the Designs Act, 2000 and acquired an exclusive right to apply and cause to be applied to the  Tupperware products the registered design comprising the features of shape, pattern and configuration etc. which appeal to the eye. These designs were original and novel and were created with the extensive knowledge, search, skill, labour and monies invested over several years by Dart‟s engineers and experts. Dart allowed and consented to TIPL‟s use of the said registered designs on the Tupperware Products as part of a worldwide arrangement as well as for the Tupperware Products to be offered for sale in India by TIPL. Unlawful use constituted a piracy of the registered design under Section 22 of the Designs Act, 2000. The defendants use of the same designs, are a fraudulent or obvious imitation of Dart‟s registered designs to enable sale of the infringing products. The striking similarity between Tupperware Products and the infringing products results in consumer‟s confusion evidenced from the market survey report dated 10.12.2004 submitted by AC Neilsen ORG MARG, an independent reputed survey organization. The affidavit of the Notary Public who witnessed the reaction of consumers during a visit by him on 18.11.2004 to the IITF also records similar observations. It was contended that the single judge‟s prima facie opinion that Dart‟s registered designs were invalid due to lack of novelty or originality due to their prior publication is erroneous. It was argued that the claim of prior disclosure of the designs was wrongly accepted by the impugned judgment. They argued that the defendants' allegation that some of the registered designs are common to trade were unproved and are mere bald allegations. They disputed the defendants‟ plea with reference to the Tupperware catalogues on the ground that photographs shown in the catalogues do not show designs as a whole and that there was a lack of depiction of the registered design shape, features, pattern configuration etc. The visual effect of the picture illustration in the said catalogues does not  12Under the Trade Marks Act 1999, the shape of goods is now statutorily recognized as being a constituent element of a trademark.

Reliance on the publication in the price lists produced by the defendants on the record of the present case is misplaced and misconceived as the price lists do not relate to the product but only to a part of the product.

                        "content": "On the merits, learned counsel submitted that 13 designs asserted in the plaint are relating to the articles like Bowls, Casseroles, Lunch Boxes, etc., which on the face of them are commonly placed and lack novelty and  originality within the meaning of Designs Act. The learned Single Judge analyzed features of each of these respective articles and came to the conclusion that all 13 designs were “pre-published” in nature and were trade variants of known designs. Counsel invited attention of the Court to the article-wise comparison of prepublication made by learned Single Judge in para 27 of the impugned judgment. It was submitted that having regard to the limited parameter for appellate intervention the single judge‟s decision should not be upset. Counsel submitted that mere registration or the fact that the appellant asserted that its products were unique or novel did not necessarily mean that they indeed were. The designs claimed to be unique or novel, were fairly commonplace; the incorporation of some features such as lines etc. did not per se mean that they became unique or design protectable. 20. It was submitted that no fault can be found with the single judge‟s opinion that design protection refusal meant facially that some other vague and unarticulated trademark right could be successfully asserted. In this context it was submitted that though the decision in Microlubesis an authority for the proposition that the lapse of design protection (at the end of the period prescribed for the duration of design registration) did not preclude existence of right to protect trade dress, through an action for passing off, there had to be strong grounds to claim that relief. Likewise, counsel submitted that Laxmikant Patel was in the context of trade dress in respect of label, packaging and get up. In the present case, the shape of the product having been held to be not unique or novel cannot claim to be distinctive, which is the basis for a passing off action. Learned counsel particularly relied on the following observations of the single judge:  16(1990) Suppl. SCC 727  17(2013) 9 SCC 221  “Thus, as per this statement of the plaintiff, the defendants were not passing off their goods as that of Tupperware Products. The  representation was that though they were of the same type as Tupperware but sold cheap. The very fact that they were representing that they were at half the price of the Tupperware Products means that the defendants were making it clear that though the products were not Tupperware Products but they were equally good and were sold at half the price of Tupperware Products. It is also interesting to note that the plaintiffs themselves say that the comparison of the two products through their experts have revealed that the goods of the defendants are not as good in quality as that of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the defendants were, at the most, puffing up their product by alleging that they are of the same quality as Tupperware Products and selling at half the rates. Thus, they have not created or tried to create any confusion but have clearly told that they are selling their own product which is represented to be as good as that of plaintiffs products. The question of passing off, Therefore, would not arise. The latin maxim \"Caveat Emptor\" meaning let the buyer beware would, Therefore apply. It was not the case of the plaintiff nor could it be that the trade name of the two products have no commonality as the plaintiffs' products are sold under the trade name of 'Tupperware', whereas the defendants' trade name is 'Signoraware'.”  Lastly, learned counsel relied on the judgment of the UK Chancery Division in Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK18for the submission that to protect any claim for distinctive shape of a mark, the applicant must prove that a significant proportion of the relevant class of persons regards the trade mark (as opposed to any other trade mark which may also be present) as indicating the origin of the goods.",

It was urged that though the Division bench ruling in Microfibres (supra) segregates the independent copyright in works of art, it cannot be asserted that copyright can subsist in drawings of purely functional day to day articles, unless they have inherent or minimum creativity.

I have seen before'. Reliance was also placed on Gopal Glass Works Limited v. Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs and Ors.21 , where Calcutta High Court stated that in undermining the novelty of a design registration, prior disclosure must be of the pattern, shape and/or configuration applied to the same article. That High Court‟s observations about publication are as follows:  “When the novelty of an article is tested against a prior published document, the main factor required to be adjudged is the visual effect and the appeal of the picture illustration….If the visual effect of the pattern, the shape or the combination of the pattern, shape, dimension, colour scheme, if any, are not clear from the picture illustrations, the novelty cannot be said to have been destroyed by prior publication, unless there are clear and unmistakable directions to make an article which is the same or similar enough to the impugned design.”  191957 RPC 239  20 1862 LJ (Ch) 457  The impugned judgment relied on Paras 3.89, 3.92, 3.93, 3.96, 3.121,3.147 and 3.181 Russell-Clarke on Industrial Designs (Sixth Edition). It was then noticed that novelty and originality was the bedrock of design protection law and that if the alleged infringer was able to show lack of novelty due to existence of the same design prior to its claim by the plaintiff, the action had to fail.

The manufacture of each final product commences from the conceptualization of the idea for a design followed by a tedious and lengthy  process involving extensive research and application of labour, skill and judgment of the experts employed by Dart, which had relied on an expert‟s affidavit describing the process of conceptualization and creation of the designs. This, according to Dart, showed that the drawings were its 'artistic works' under the proviso of Section 2(c)(i) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Since these works were created during the course of the employment with Dart, by reason of Section 17 of the said Act, Dart became copyright owner of the artistic works. The plaintiffs relied on Sections 13 and 14 of the Copyright Act; they are entitled to bundle of exclusive right including the right to reproduce the artistic work i.e. the product drawing in any material form including depiction in three dimensions of a two dimensional work or in two dimension of a three dimensional work as well as to make any adaptation of the artistic work. It is also the case of the plaintiffs that the product drawings and mould drawings created by Dart determine the size and shape of the parts of the mould such that each part of the mould performs its function smoothly so as to arrive at the end product as designed. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants‟ products are an obvious imitation of the Tupperware Products and there is a material and sufficient degree of objective similarity amounting to deceptive similarity between the two products. Therefore, the defendants have, by manufacturing infringing products, produced 'infringing copies' as defined under Section 2(m) of the Copyright Act, 1957. The infringement is possible by use of computer techniques possibly by 2D or 3D scanning, along with other inspection and measurement tools followed by use of such assimilated designs to ultimately reproduce the assimilated designs in a tangible and finished form i.e. the infringing products.",

The court held that the claim of copyright in the industrial drawings and designs, which were being used for manufacturing purposes, is not maintainable. Prima facie, the single judge held that that once drawings were made for creating the ultimate product design, the copyright in the said drawings cannot be claimed under the Copyright Act. It was observed that Section 15 of the Copyright Act provides that once a design is registered under the Designs Act, copyright therein shall not subsist. Such a copyright in any design ceases even when any article to which the design has been applied has been reproduced more than 50 times by an industrial process by the owner of the copyright.

                        "content": "The term \"artistic work\" has been defined expansively in the Copyright Act. Section 15 (2) of the said Act does not apply to artistic works because of the definition of \"design\" (Section 2(d) of the Designs Act) which states that “design” means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether in two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms, by any industrial process or means…. and does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (43 of 1958) or property mark as defined in section 479 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or any artistic work as defined in clause (c) of section 2 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957).\" However, this ipso facto does not lead the court to agree with the plaintiff‟s contention. The language of Section 15 of the Copyright Act makes it clear that copyright does not subsist in a registered design. The rationale for this is that someone's choice of design registration is a conscious decision to use the underlying work, for mass production. The design then reaches, through the medium of the product or the article, a wider audience; it has a commercial element. This is of course possible in the cases of designs of products and articles that are sold widely or have a market. Such is not the case with an artistic work-typically a painting a drawing or even a sculpture for instance (which are closest species of copyrights that overlap with designs). Yet the transformation of a work of art into a design results in the  Copyright Act  Designs law.  possibility of its protection as a design. Section 15 (1) dictates that if this kind of work is registered as a design, there is no copyright protection. Section 15 (2) on the other hand, says that if a work is capable of design registration, and is not registered, but replicated as a product or article through a design more than 50 times through mechanical process, copyright in that work ceases. This dimension renders the issue complex, because works of art, primarily so, which are also capable of design registration or have been registered as design, would lose even copyright protection, thus undermining creativity and the efficacy of copyright protection itself. This paradox -and the strain in enunciating a satisfactory concord between these two disparate threads of thinking was noticed long ago, in King Features Syndicate Incorporated and Frank Cecil Betts, the Personal representative of Elzie Chrisler Segar, Deceased v. O & M Kleeman Ld.25 In that case, the anthropomorphic cartoon strip character \"Popeye the Sailor\" used in comics and later in films, was reproduced in the form of toys and brooches. The author, did not industrialize the cartoon character, but later, due to its popularity, he licensed some manufacturers to produce articles in the toys, brooches, etc. The House of Lords drew a distinction between copyright under the on the one hand, and \"design copyright\" under the relevant The Court concluded that such design rights are separate and their extinction did not result in cessation of copyright in the work (i.e., the cartoon character in question). It was held that:  241988 FSR 292  “……The statutory definition of design now in force is found in Section 19 of the Patents and Designs Act,1919, which replaces that given in Section 93 of the Patents and Designs Act, 1907. The operative definition so far as here material is: “ „Design‟ means only the „‟features of shape, configuration, pattern, or ornament  applied to any article „‟by any industrial process or means whether manual, mechanical, or chemical, “separate or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged “solely by the eye”. Thus design involves certain elements: there must be features of shape, configuration, pattern, or ornament and these must be applied (or intended to be applied in the words of Section 22 of the Copyright Act) to any article by way of industrial means or process. Section 22 emphasises the same aspects. Designs to which the section is to apply are those used or intended to be used as models or patterns to be multiplied by any industrial process. Thus a design may be the shape of a coal scuttle, a basin, a motor car, a locomotive engine or any material object, it may be the shape embodied in a sculptured or plastic figure, which is to serve as a model for commercial production, or it may be a drawing in the flat of a complex pattern, intended to be used for the manufacture of things such as linoleum or wall paper. Design copyright is thus to be distinguished from artistic copyright..”  251941 (48) RPC 207  The Supreme Court succinctly set out the object of the Designs Act and Parliamentary intention in affording protection to designs, in Bharat Glass Tube v Gopal Glass Works Ltd26 . The Court held as follows:  “The purpose of the (<http://indiankanoon.org/doc/931654/>)Designs Act is to protect novel designs devised to be applied to (or in other words, to govern the shape and configuration of) particular articles to be manufactured and marketed commercially. It is not to protect principles of operation or invention which, if profitable at all, ought to be made the subject-matter of a patent. Nor is it to prevent the copying of the direct product of original artistic effort in producing a drawing. Indeed the whole purpose of a design is that it shall not stand on its own as an artistic work but shall be copied by embodiment in a commercially produced artefact. Thus the primary concern, is what the finished article is to look like and not with what it does and the monopoly provided for the proprietor is effected by according not, as in the case of ordinary copyright, a right to prevent direct reproduction of the image registered as the design but the right, over a much more limited period, to prevent the manufacture and sale of article of a design not  substantially different from the registered design. The emphasis therefore is upon the visual image conveyed by the manufactured article. \"  26AIR 2008 SC 2520  The Division Bench ruling in in Microfibres27(supra) where the Division Bench observed as follows:  Designs Act section 2(c)  \"23. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between an original artistic work, and the design derived from it for industrial application on an article. This position is clarified by the use of the expression \"only\" before the words \"the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours\" in the definition of \"design\" in the . Therefore, the original artistic work, which may have inspired the creation of a design, is not merely the feature of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours which are created to apply to an article by an industrial process. The original artistic work is something different from the design. Secondly, the definition of \"design\" expressly excludes, inter alia, any artistic work defined in of the Copyright act, 1957.  ***********",

                        "content": "We thus summarize our findings as follows: - a.  The definition of ‗artistic work' has a very wide connotation as it is not circumscribed by any limitation of the work possessing any artistic quality. Even an abstract work, such as a few lines or curves arbitrarily drawn would qualify as an artistic work. It may be two dimensional or three dimensional. The artistic work may or may not have visual appeal.  b.  Section 14(c)  The rights to which a holder of an original artistic work is entitled are enumerated in of the Copyright act.  c.  It is the exclusive right of the holder of a Copyright in an original artistic work to reproduce the work in any material form. For example, a drawing of an imaginary futuristic automobile, which is an original artistic work, may be reproduced in the three-dimensional material form using an element, such as a metal sheet.  d.  Designs  Act  The design protection in case of registered works under the cannot be extended to include the copyright protection to the works which were industrially produced.  e.  Copyright Act  Designs Act  A perusal of the and the and indeed the Preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Designs Act makes it clear that the legislative intent was to grant a higher  protection to pure original artistic works such as paintings, sculptures etc and lesser protection to design activity which is commercial in nature. The legislative intent is, thus, clear that the protection accorded to a work which is commercial in nature is lesser than and not to be equated with the protection granted to a work of pure art.  f.  Section 2(c)  Section 2(d)  Copyright Act  Designs Act Copyright Act  The original paintings/artistic works which may be used to industrially produce the designed article would continue to fall within the meaning of the artistic work defined under of the Copyright Act, 1957 and would be entitled to the full period of copyright protection as evident from the definition of the design under of the Designs Act. However, the intention of producing the artistic work is not relevant. g. This is precisely why the legislature not only limited the protection by mandating that the copyright shall cease under the in a registered design but in addition, also deprived copyright protection to designs capable of being registered under the , but not so registered, as soon as the concerned design had been applied more than 50 times by industrial process by the owner of the copyright or his licensee. h.

                        "content": "For copyright protection (since the plaintiff asserts that the drawings of the products, i.e., bowls, etc) are “artistic works” the essential prerequisite for protection, should be “original” under the Act. The content of what is “original” has undergone considerable change from the previously applicable “sweat of the brow‟ doctrine spelt out in University of London Press (supra) to the “modicum of creativity” standard put forth in Fiest Publication Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service28 . The Supreme Court has also signified a shift in Eastern Book Company &Ors. v. D.B. Modak & Anr29 following the Canadian Supreme Court‟s judgment in CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada30 , it rejected the sweat of the brow doctrine, (which conferred copyright on works merely because time, energy, skill and labour was expended, that is, originality of skill and labour), and held that the work must be original “in the sense that by virtue of selection, coordination or arrangement of pre-existing data contained in the work, a work somewhat different in character is produced by the author”. The Supreme Court noticed that the two positions i.e. the sweat of the brow on the one hand, and “modicum of creativity” were extreme; it preferred a higher threshold than the doctrine of “sweat of the brow” yet, not as high as “modicum of creativity”. Therefore in India too, the law has recognized the  shift, and mandates that not every effort or industry, or expending of skill, results in copyrightable work, but only those which create works that are somewhat different in character, involve some intellectual effort, and involve a certain degree of creativity. This standard of originality is now applicable in respect of the plaintiffs‟ claim to copyright of its drawings. There are further limitations in the law of copyright such as the idea expression merger. By this, Courts have refused to protect (through copyright) the expression of an idea, which can be expressed only in a very limited manner, because doing so would confer monopoly on the ides itself. The decision in Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corporation v. Kalpakian31 is illustrative in this regard. The plaintiffs there sued the defendants asking them to refrain from manufacturing bee shaped jewel pins. The Court held that the bee shaped jewel pin was an idea that anyone was free to copy, the expression of which could be possible only in a few ways; therefore, no copyright could subsist in it.",

Though the court cannot comment on the veracity of such claim, at least the decision in Modak (supra) now binds it to examine every copyright claim closely, to see whether there is some minimum creativity. Now, the plaint nowhere discloses that the drawings (i.e. the artistic works here) have any inherent capability of art: it is evident that these drawings are of commonplace every day articles used in households. The idea expression doctrine, itself would prima facie prevent copyright protection because the depiction of daily articles cannot per se be  “enclosed” to create a monopoly where the legitimate monopoly (design right) which the plaintiffs could have claimed, has not been prima facie established by them. For these reasons, it is held that the single judge‟s reasoning as to the lack of prima facie strength in the copyright infringement claim, cannot warrant interference.",

Sales of those products, the amount spent on research and development etc. and various awards those products had taken was the basis that the plaintiffs‟ products are well known and have acquired household popularity because of their quality, technical and functional superiority. The defendants‟ household plastic containers i.e., the infringing products were advertised as 'Microwavable Crockery' made from food grade plastic material meant to be sold to the same class of consumers as Tupperware Products. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants infringed the design and copyright of the plaintiffs by manufacturing and selling infringing products which have a striking resemblance in shape, configuration and pattern of the Tupperware Products. The infringing products, i.e., household goods are being targeted to be sold to the same set of consumers as of the Tupperware Products. The plaintiffs relied on the applicability of the test of impression of an unwary customer, who would be misled into purchasing the infringing product, believing it to be that of the plaintiffs. The application of designs identical or similar to the Tupperware Product designs by the defendants to the infringing products is clearly creating and is likely to further create confusion and misconception in the minds of the customers leading them to  believe that the infringing products of the defendants are the products emanating from TIPL while in fact it is not so.

Moreover the defendants are actively trying to cash on the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs by imitating and/or advertising the design of \"Executive Lunch\" carry bag recently introduced in the market by the plaintiff which product of the defendants is identical in colour combination to the plaintiffs'  product and was found being sold by the defendants at the Trade Fair held in November, 2004. The brochure picked up from the India International Trade Fair shows a new design of the bag of the \"Executive Lunch\" which is identical in design, colour combination of green and black coloured check, shape and placement of the trade name, material and other configuration used in the bag recently launched by plaintiffs. The time lag between the launch of the infringing product and the Tupperware Product, being short, is helping the defendants in being successful in passing off the infringing products as Tupperware Product to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill acquired by the Tupperware Products. Such a practice is indicative of the intention of the defendants to not only make material and substantial imitation of the design of Tupperware Products but also an attempt to pass off the infringing products as Tupperware Products.  v)  Apart from the overall shape of the infringing products being identical to the shape of the Tupperware Products, one of the infringing products namely \"Crazy Bowl\" is identical in shape to the state of the art Tupperware Product namely \"Serving Bowl\" along with \"Seal for Bowl\" brought to India only for the purposes of being used as an incentive/promotional product and initially not yet sale but intended to be launched for sale in India in the near future. It is submitted that the design of the said product duly registered by plaintiff No. 1 in India is the state of art design using special moulding techniques and machinery to manufacture the said product. Though the plaintiff No. 2 has only distributed the said product as a promotional item to its sales force and has not yet launched the said product for sale in India, the defendants appeared to have obtained the said product either from a member of the sales force of plaintiff No. 2 or the defendants may have purchased the said product abroad. In the case of the said product the defendants appeared to have not only imitated the said product but have also infringed the copyright in the design. Moreover, the launch by the defendants of the said product in the Indian market after the date of its design registration in favor of the plaintiff No. 1 but prior to the launch of the Tupperware Product in India is also indicative of the defendants actively trying to cash on the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiffs by imitating the design of the \"Serving Bowl\" sold subsequently in the Indian market.

On the contrary, representation was that they were the products of different  manufacturer namely the Signoraware Products and were being sold at half the price of Tupperware Products though they were look alike of Tupperware Products. Thus, as per this statement of the plaintiff, the defendants were not passing off their goods as that of Tupperware Products. The representation was that though they were of the same type as Tupperware but sold cheap. The very fact that they were representing that they were at half the price of the Tupperware Products means that the defendants were making it clear that though the products were not Tupperware Products but they were equally good and were sold at half the price of Tupperware Products. It is also interesting to note that the plaintiffs themselves say that the comparison of the two products through their experts have revealed that the goods of the defendants are not as good in quality as that of the plaintiffs.

                        "content": "In the context of passing off, undoubtedly trade dress and the get up of the packaging, presentation of the product through label, etc constitute essential components of the goodwill and reputation of a commercial enterprise (Ref. Laxmikant Patel). William Grant & Sons Ltd v McDowell & Co Ltd33also supports such a proposition. Yet, for seeking even prima facie protection in the nature of interim injunction there should be material disclosing that the general public associates the shape in question (which is asserted by the plaintiff as their distinctive mark or get up) only with the plaintiff. Whilst in the case of trade dress in the form of label or mark, distinctiveness is easily discernable, in the case of shape based trade dress, the plaintiff has to necessarily show that the get up of the product or article (over which certain exclusivity or distinctiveness is claimed) has an integral association only with it. Unless this requirement is pleaded and established, (and for interim injunction purposes, at least prima facie) every product with  a commonplace shape would “ride” on the reputation of an exclusive trademark, based on a distinctive name, label or color combination of the packaging or label, etc. In this case, the distinctiveness of the shape of the product-asserted to be unique or solely associated with the plaintiff has not been so pleaded and established.  33 1994 FSR 690 (Del)",

                        "content": "a)  The plaintiff is a company running renowned chain of retail stores and galleries showcasing and selling unique lifestyle products which are classy and exclusive in design, style, pattern, quality and standard. The plaintiff’s stores under the name GOODEARTH sells the lifestyle, home making products and décor items which are exclusively designed at the creative house of the plaintiff Company by a specialized creative team and are unique.  b)  Defendants are engaged in the illegal acts of imitating the unique motifs, pattern, art works and designs of the plaintiff and applying the same in various permutations and combinations on their products for sale and thereby are directly engaged in illegal acts of passing-off, unfair competition and dilution. The defendant No.1 was working as a Design Consultant with the plaintiff company on retainership basis. The plaintiff is the originator, inventor and owner of the said motifs, pattern, designs and piece of art and the plaintiff is seeking restrain orders by way of present suit before this Court against the defendants who are adopting and using visually, structurally and deceptively similar motifs, pattern, designs and piece of art of the plaintiff and selling their products with the impugned design on their website www.indiacircus.com are clearly violating plaintiff’s rights. The defendants’ such acts constitutes passing off, unfair competition and dilution.  c)  The plaintiff is the original creator, inventor and owner of various designer collections including SERAI, PERIYAR, VRINDAVAN, BALI MYNAH, LOTUS, ROSE PRINCESS and FALCON and have been using the same on a wide range of products. The plaintiff is also the registered owner of copyrights in the art works of Periyar, Vrindavan and Lotus collections under the Designs Act, 2000.  d)  A comparison of the motifs, pattern, art works and designs of the plaintiff and the impugned articles visually, structurally and  deceptively similar look, art works, pattern, design and get up being sold by the defendants on their website www.indiacircus.com are reproduced in para 5 of the plaint.  e)  The defendant No.1 was working as a Design Consultant with the plaintiff company on retainership basis and had been associated with the plaintiff for almost 2 years. It is submitted that during these years of employment, the defendant No.1 had no rights in any of the art-work, motifs, patterns, designs he worked upon or dealt with in any manner whatsoever in as much as all the rights therein vested with the plaintiff company only. That in the year 2012 he left the plaintiff company and thereafter is providing for sale of identical patterns that too in relation to identical range of products on the website www.indiacircus.com with a malafide intent to encash upon the goodwill/reputation of the plaintiff. He had been employed with the plaintiff-company since 10th May, 2010 and since then his association was renewed from time to time. That the contract with defendant No.1 was renewed for the last time on 1st August, 2012 wherein his contract period was extended till 30th September, 2012. Thereafter, his contract with the plaintiff company was never renewed as per consent of the parties and he had ceased to be associated with the plaintiff company.  f)  The defendants are selling various products with the impugned motifs, art work, look, pattern and designs on their website www.indiacircus.com. By adopting deceptively similar designs,  art works and motifs, the defendants are trying to create confusion in the market and encash upon the goodwill and reputation earned by the plaintiff over the years. They are unfairly competing with the plaintiff by way of adopting the plaintiff’s unique art features, pattern, motifs and designs and using them on their articles.  g)  The plaintiff-company is in the business of manufacturing and selling creative, exclusively designed and unique lifestyle retail products such as home, décor, furniture, apparel and other related goods and has various retail stores located all across India. The plaintiff also has franchise arrangement in other countries like Singapore, Turkey and Nepal. The brand GOODEARTH is well-known in the world of lifestyle and art. The plaintiff has over 9 retail stores in India and an online store under the website www.goodearth.in. The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark GOODEARTH in several classes in India and abroad by virtue of the prior adoption.  h)  It is submitted by the plaintiff that the design team of the plaintiff creates unique designs with an inspiration from natural beauty like botanical images of flowers, leaves, mountain, trees or with an inspiration from lifestyles like Mughal images, luxury living etc. These motifs, logos, patterns, art-works and designs with painstaking efforts are tried in permutation and combinations over fabrics, cutlery items, paper items, glass etc. and thus after  long process a designed article is conceived and introduced to the market.  i)  The strength of the plaintiff lies in making innovative and catchy patterns of designs, keeping in mind the various preferences and requirements of consumers across classes. The plaintiff is constantly innovating new designs, patterns and motifs to cater to the changing needs and tastes of consumers. In fact since the beginning of the year 1996, the plaintiff has attained a turnover of around Rs.91 crores for the Financial Year 2012-2013.  j)  The plaintiff created, conceptualized and designed various designs including SERAI, PERIYAR, VRINDAVAN, LOTUS, BALI MYNAH, ROSE PRINCESS and FALCON to be used on various products including bath sheets, table cloths, mugs, bowls, teapots, etc. under their GOODEARTH'S Collection. The aforesaid collections are one of the most famous collections of GOODEARTH.  k)  The products of GOODEARTH have been extensively written about in various press articles, magazines and news letter. The public at large recognize the unique products of the GOODEARTH with them owing to their classy and memorable art work. Various such articles discussing the plaintiff’s range of products and their popularity in the market are being filed with the present plaint.  l)  Plaintiffs’ products are even sought after by foreign tourists who have heard about the plaintiffs due to the unparalleled reputation which has spilled beyond the geographical boundaries of India. The plaintiff’s design house at Khan Market (Delhi) is visited by foreign tourists on a daily basis. The reputation of the plaintiff has travelled both by being covered in print media and by word of mouth due to the high quality and enormous effort put into the designing of the products. The products of the plaintiff are also used extensively for gift purposes.  m)  The defendants through their website www.indiacircus.com are allegedly providing for sale of various products including cushion cover, mugs, bed sheets etc. with the motifs, art works, patterns, designing and prints which are a blatant copy of the plaintiff’s creativity. Undoubtedly, the defendants are subsequent adopters of the said motifs, art works, patterns and design and are using the same in respect of identical products range as that of the plaintiff in gross violation of the plaintiff’s rights.  n)  The defendants allegedly being in the similar business marketing various products in India, are obviously well aware of the worldwide reputation of the plaintiff. The sole endeavour of the defendants is to ride on the goodwill created by the plaintiff in its well known designs including Serai, Periyar, Vrindavan, Lotus, Bali Mynah, Rose Princess and Falcon Cushion to be used on  various products including bath sheets, table cloths, mugs, bowls, teapots, etc. Infact three designs of the plaintiff, i.e. PERIYAR, LOUTUS and VRINDAVAN are registered designs of the plaintiff under the Designs Act, 2000.  o)  The defendants by creating confusion in the market thereby attempting to passing off its designs as that of the plaintiff thereby not only violating valuable common law rights of the plaintiff but also causing substantial loss and damage to the plaintiff’s business and reputation at large.  p)  Since the purchase of the impugned products of the defendants is done online, the buyers are often confused with the products sold by the defendants as that of the plaintiff as the bare look of the products with the impugned design looks exactly the same. As the buyers do not have the opportunity to physically see and inspect the quality of the product when they purchase the same through the website, they are easily deceived as and when they receive the products as the same is not of the quality and standard that is maintained by the plaintiff company.  q)  The proliferation of identical motifs, logos, patterns and designs would lead to complete tarnishment and blurring of the plaintiff company’s goodwill which would be irreparable and un-compensable in the form of damages. The intention of the defendants is to ride piggy back on the success of the plaintiff company’s motifs, logos, patterns and designs. Such acts of unfair competition are also liable to be injuncted.",

                        "content": "As already mentioned, the defendants have filed the reply, written statement, counter claim as well as application for vacation of the interim order. The defence and all pleas raised by the defendants are common in the pleadings, the same is narrated as under:  a)  All the plaintiff’s designs in question are inspired by work of art available since centuries and the same are not being original designs as claimed by the plaintiff who is not the owner, inventor or creator of the same and no one can claim exclusive right on the Heritage/ Indian Tradition / Nature.  b)  It is the version of plaintiff that its designs namely Vrindavan, Periyar, Lotus are registered for being used on CUSHIONS and as such the said deigns used by the defendants on the cushions, amounts to infringement of its rights. But the plaintiff has failed to place on record any registration certificate and secondly the product CUSHIONS falls under Class 6 as mentioned in the Design Rules, 2001 whereas the plaintiff is claiming its registration under Class 5 and 7 of the Designs Rules, 2001. It is the case of the plaintiff that three designs of the plaintiff i.e. Periyar, Lotus and Vrindavan are registered designs of the plaintiff under the provisions of the said Act, though no documents in support of the same has been produced by the plaintiff. Apart from the said three designs, the plaintiff has also alleged imitation of other four designs i.e. Falcon, Rose Princess, Seria and Bali Mynah. No relief can be claimed or can  be granted to the plaintiff in respect of all the seven designs i.e. Falcon, Rose Princess, Periyar, Seria, Lotus, Bali Mynah and Vrindavan as the alleged designs of the plaintiff are not new or original. The registered designs (i.e. Periyar, Loutus and Vrindavan) were in public domain prior to the date of claim of the plaintiff and the products have been previously published.  c)  Since November, 2011 the defendant No.1 has started the defendant No.2 Company who has acquired an excellent reputation in its field with having over a few hundred products on its website and various designs. The defendant No.2 was established in November, 2011 who is engaged in designing, marketing, selling and retailing lifestyle products and also offering design label and sophisticated designs. The defendant No.2 (India Circus) is closely associated with defendant No.1, a well established and renowned designer who has also been associated with a number of lifestyle brands like 'The Elephant Company', 'The Bombay Store', 'Good Earth' (i.e. the plaintiff), Zeba, Godrej and Metro. Defendant No.3 offers defendant No.2 a technological backbone with his trail-blazing skills and experience with software. In the past defendant No.3 has worked on a handful of projects, crafting software meticulously tailored for each brand's management.  d)  The defendants have compared each design with the plaintiffs design as well. The details of inspiration by the defendants in order to also show that the plaintiffs’ all designs are pre-known,  prior published and some of them are in public domain for the last many centuries. The comparison chart is reproduced herein below:  Perusal of the aforesaid would demonstrate that though the design has been named as Falcon it is a picture of an emperor with a falcon in his hand. The design of the plaintiff - emperor standing with a falcon in his hand is a copy of an Indian Mughal painting dated around 1600-1605. The actual painting is presently kept at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  The plaintiff is aware of the same and hence it is not even the case of the plaintiff that the said design has been registered by them under the provisions of the said Act. However, the plaintiff is not claiming any right on the basis of registration of the said design, thus no case for infringement has been made out.  The said design is of a princess with a rose in her hand. The painting which is not on display but available on the web site of the Art Institute of Chicago. The design of the defendants apart from a princess with a rose has various other features and combination of colours.  In view of the aforesaid there is no way that the plaintiff can be heard to say that the plaintiff is the creator of the said design. The  plaintiff is aware of the same and hence it is not even the case of the plaintiff that the said design has been registered by them under the provisions of the Design Act. As the plaintiff is not claiming to be the registered owner of the said design, no case for infringement of design or passing off is made out.  The design of the plaintiff demonstrates that the same consist of two palm trees. A part of the design of the defendants also consists of Palm trees but there is a distinct difference even as far as the palm trees are concerned. The leaves of the palm trees in the design of the plaintiff and that of the defendants are of a different style. The design of the defendants apart from two palm trees has various other features like the elephant, flowers and a jail window and combination of colours. An identical painting of two palm trees is also available on wayfair.com called the Tropical Dance III by Megan  Duncanso. A design of a palm tree cannot be said to be a new or an original design or a design which has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any other country by publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the application for registration by the plaintiff.  The window in the both the designs is a window as found on Humanyun's Tomb and various other tombs. No proprietary in respect of the same can be claimed by the plaintiff. The design of the Plaintiff has the said window with a picture of an elephant standing in front of the window. No proprietary can be claimed by the plaintiff either in respect of the window or an elephant. The design of the defendants is an inspiration taken from the window which is found on  various tombs and an elephant inside the window. The two designs are not familiar. The two elephants in question are also not identical.  A design of a window found in a tomb or an elephant cannot be said to be a new or an original design or a design which has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any other country by publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the application for registration by the plaintiff. In view of the aforesaid, no case for passing off is made out.  The comparison of the design of the plaintiff and the defendants demonstrates that there is nothing in common or identical. There is no lotus in the design of the defendants as found in the design of the plaintiffs. The design of a lotus flower cannot be said to be a new or an original design or a design which has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any other country by  publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the application for registration by the plaintiff.  The perusals of the design of the plaintiff and the defendants demonstrate that the two are completely different. The trees in both the designs are placed differently and the designs of the palms are also different. The design of the defendants apart from palm tree has  various other features like the Gateway of India and people standing thereon and combination of colours. A design of a tree cannot be said to be a new or an original design or a design which has not been disclosed to the public anywhere in India or in any other country by publication in tangible form or by use or in any other way prior to the application for registration by the plaintiff. A similar design of Palms is also available on the website of Exotic India which is a part of a painting called Akbar and Tansen visit Haridas.  The design of the plaintiff i.e. Bali Mynah, no comparative chart has been provided by the plaintiff either in the suit or in the present application but a relief in respect of the same has been claimed. A perusal of the design of the plaintiff and the defendants demonstrates that there is nothing in common. The plaintiffs have not made out any case in the plaint or the present application as to what is the infringement committed by the defendants. In any event it is not the  case of the plaintiff that the said design in question has been registered by them.  So far as the claim of the Plaintiff regarding passing off is concerned, merely imitation and the similarity would not be sufficient and unless the intention to pass off is established the case of passing off is made out. The defendants have their own website www.indiacircus.com where the products of the defendants are sold. Any person buying the products manufactured by the defendants from their website will always be aware that they are buying the products of the defendants.",

                        "content": "Reply on behalf of the plaintiff to the defence raised by the defendants  The plaintiff has filed the rejoinder as well as reply to the application filed by the defendants for vacation of the interim order already granted on 1st May, 2014. The gist of the same are mentioned hereunder:  i)  The instant suit is a suit for passing off/ acts of unfair competition and not a suit for infringement of designs registered under the Designs Act, 2000 as the defendants have throughout in their reply tried to allege that (a) the design registration certificates have not been produced (b) the designs of the plaintiff are not  registrable under the Designs Act, 2000 as the same are not original designs.  ii)  The position with regard to passing off in designs has been settled by this Court in Mohan Lal, Proprietor of Mourya Industries vs Sona Paints & Hardwares and Micolube India Limited vs Rakesh Kumar Trading as Saurab Industries & Ors. 200(2013) DLT 322. It was held that in a passing off action the Plaintiff would have to establish the following ingredients:- (i)  that there is goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which the plaintiff offers, in the mind of the purchasing public, i.e., the consumers, who associate or are in a position to identify such goods or services by virtue of trademark used, which could include the get-up, trade-dress, signs, packaging, label, etc.  (ii)  that the defendant has employed misrepresentation which has made the consumers believe that the defendant’s goods are those of the plaintiff.  (iii)  And lastly, that the defendant's action has caused damage or is calculated to cause damage;  iii)  All the aforesaid conditions are satisfied in the present suit. It is submitted that the plaintiff enjoys formidable goodwill and reputation in respect of its unique designs, motifs and patterns. It is further submitted that motifs, logos, patterns and designs of the plaintiff have become so popular over the years that the purchasing public always associates or identifies such designs  with the plaintiff only and none else. The defendants are using such identical motifs, patterns and designs merely to take unfair advantage of plaintiff’s design and create confusion in the minds of the consumer with respect to such designs, motifs and patterns.  iv)  The defendant No.1 was a part of the plaintiff’s company when most of these designs were designed and created by the creative team of the plaintiff company. The defendant No.1 was aware of the sources from where the inspiration was drawn. After leaving the plaintiff company, the defendant No.1 had started designing the products using the same inspiration and using it in an identical manner as that of the plaintiff.  v)  The defendant No.1 being aware of the same is still using the said design in order to ride on the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff company and to encash upon the goodwill of the plaintiff and to compete with the plaintiff.  vi)  One of such designs is the PERIYAR design of the plaintiff which was created by the plaintiff’s team in the year 2003 and the defendant No.1 has always been aware of the originality of the said design and the rights of the plaintiffs’ vesting therein, there is no reasonable explanation whatsoever which has been given by the defendants in the reply for adopting such identical motifs.  vii)  The fact that the inspiration of Mughal art and architecture was never defendant No.1’s style of designing prior to joining the plaintiff’s Company i.e. May, 2010. The material placed on record would shows that the defendant No.1 had not created any  designs deriving inspiration from Mughal art and architecture prior to starting the defendant No.2 company. The defendant No.1 used to create designs deriving inspiration from household things, surroundings and even bollywood. In fact, the website of defendant No.1, i.e. www.krsnamehta.com shows the designing style of the defendant No.1. The entire range of products and designs that has been provided on the website are design which are inspired from flaura and fauna, surroundings and household. It was only after the termination of defendant No.1 that the defendant No.1 had started using such inspiration and designs identical to the plaintiff’s design merely to ride on the goodwill of the plaintiff.  viii)  The defendants stated that they had started the defendant No.2 company in November, 2011. However, defendant No.1 left the plaintiff company only in the year 2012. The defendant No.1 had never disclosed it to the plaintiff company that the defendant No.1 had started a new company and it was only in the year 2012 that the defendant No.1 had written an email to the plaintiff stating that he had accepted the role of Creative director in the defendant No.2 Company. There was a mutual understanding between the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 that the defendant No.1 would not work independently without seeking prior permission from the plaintiff company. Thus, act of defendant No.1 is unfair but is also guilty of breach of trust. Print out from the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India  showing the date of incorporation of the defendant No.2 company is already placed on record.  ix)  The defendant No.1 has not only copied the designs of the plaintiff Company but is also guilty of copying various other successful designs in the market and misappropriating the same in trade. An actual instance has been brought to the notice of the plaintiff company by way of an email dated 10th July, 2014 from Mr. Karan, Chief Coordinator of an Export Company wherein he showed his concern to the plaintiff about the defendant No.1’s conduct towards copying their patented system and various deigns. The copy of the said email is placed on record.",

Mere floral designs/Ornamentations/jails admittedly taken from nature are not protectable as they don't satisfy the test of original artistic work, nor is such right claimed. This Court has held that such elements are not protectable in Servewell Products Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. vs. Dolphin —  (2010)  43 PTC 507 (Del) — Para 18 which reads as under:- “18. There are two aspects which require consideration, even at the prima facie stage. One, whether there is the minimum creativity element, in the depiction of colours and their positioning, and if so, whether their combination  with elements, for which no copyright protection can be claimed, (i.e. the flowers) would render them original artistic works. The kind of colours depicted, and the shapes in which they are shown horizontal yellow bars or strokes, (in A-84938/09); blue stripe/ strokes forming the background for a pale yellow and white flower, (in A84944/09) Golden flora set in yellow (A-84940/09); violet flower petals set against horizontal violet and white stripes (A-84942/09) and tulips in vase, set in yellow (A84943/09) are commonplace. The colour depictions are in the form of broad lines or stripes, and appear to have been created by using some computer software, or else are plain brush strokes, matching the colours of the flowers and floral designs they underlay. They do not fulfil the new originality or creativity standard spelt out in Eastern Book Co. Such being the case, the mere combination of two non-copyrightable elements by itself – at least in this case, does not result in a new copyrightable artistic work. So far as A-84919 is concerned, no claim to any colour combination is made; in fact the copyright registration certificate attaches only a pink flower depiction. This Court is also mindful of the circumstance that copyright, based on originality or uniqueness is inadmissible to mere colours or colour combinations. For these reasons, the Court does not prima facie discern any copyright infringement.”",

                        "content": "The following decisions are also referred by the defendants’ counsel:  (i)  In Benchairs Limited v. Chair Centre Limited, (1972) FSR 397, Mr. Justice Graham of Chancery Division summed up the principles as follows:- \"The essence of passing off is, it is said by Mr. Watson, and I agree, the false representation by the defendant that his goods are those of the plaintiff, as has been laid down by the authorities for well over a century in numerous cases. This is for example, noted by Harman,  L.J. in in Hoffmann — La Roche v. D.D.S.A. [1972] R.P.C. 1 at 18, where he quotes the words of Lord Halsbury in Powell v. Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Co. Ltd. [1897] A.C. 710, who in his turn is quoting the words of Turner, L.J. in Burgress v. Burgess (1853) 3 De G, M & G. 896. If there is no such false representation there can be no passing off, and the mere copying of the shape of the plaintiffs' article is not in itself such a representation. Anyone is entitled, subject to some monopoly or statutory right preventing him, to copy and sell any article on the market, and false representation and passing off only arises when a defendant does something further which suggests that the article which he is selling is that of the plaintiff This he may do by a direct representation to that effect such as by the use of the plaintiffs' name or mark, or by an indirect representation such as by imitation of get-up by enclosing the article in a distinctive package which is similar to that used by the plaint: \"  (ii) In Hodgkinson & Corby Limited v. Wards Mobility Services  Ltd., (1995) FSR 169, it was held as under:- \"Now the ingredients of passing off are the \"classical trinity\" namely, (1) goodwill of the plaintiff (2) misrepresentation by the defendant, (3) consequent damage. The plaintiff's problem of proof when there is no manifest badge of trade origin such as a trade mark becomes hard. This is so in the case of a descriptive or semi-descriptive word such as \"Camel Hair\". It is perhaps even more so where one is concerned simply with the appearance of the article with no self-evident trade origin frill or embellishment. For people are likely to buy the article because of what it is, not in reliance on any belief of any particular trade origin. This is so whether they but it for its eye-appeal (e.g. glass dogs) or for what it does (e.g. the copy Rubik cube of  (iii)  In the same tone, Halsbury (Trade Marks, 4th Ed., 1984 Vol.48, para 187) says that in a passing off action the \"degree of similarity of the name, mark or other features concerned is important but not necessarily decisive, so that an action for infringement of a registered trademark may succeed on the same facts where a passing off action fails or vice versa\". As to vice-versa, Kerly says (para 16.12), an infringement action may fail where plaintiff' cannot prove registration or that its registration extends to the goods or to all the goods in question or because the registration is invalid and yet the plaintiff may show that by imitating the mark or otherwise, the defendant has done what is calculated to pass off his goods as those of plaintiff.  (iv)  In Schweppes Ltd. v. Gibbons, (1905) 22 RPC 601(HL) Lord Halsbury said, while dealing with a passing off action that \"the whole question in these cases is whether the thing – taken in its entirety, looking at the whole thing – is such that in the ordinary course of things a person with reasonable comprehension and with proper insight would be deceived\". Defendant's name on his goods is an indication of there being no case of passing off. In the present case, defendant's goods contain the words 'Cadbury' on their wrapper. As per the principle laid down in Fisons Ltd v. E.J. Godwin [(1976) RPC 653], the occurrence of the name 'Cadbury' on the defendant's wrapper is a factor to be considered while deciding the question of passing off. Similarly in King & Co. Ltd vs. Gillard and Co. Ltd.,  [22 RPC 327] and Cadbury-Schweppes Pvt. Ltd. vs. The Pub. Squash Ltd., (1981) RPC 429, it was held that the presence of defendant's name on his goods was an indication that there was no passing off, even if the trade dress was similar. The fact that the defendant's wrapper contains the word 'Cadbury' above the words PICNIC is therefore a factor which is to be taken into account.”  (v)  In S.M. Dyechem Ltd. vs. Cadbury Ltd., (2000) 5 SCC 573, the Supreme Court has held that in a passing off action, additions, get-up or trade-dress might be relevant to enable the defendant to escape. In infringement cases, such facts do no assume relevance. (It is pertinent to mention here that the above said decision referred by the defendants has been overruled by the subsequent judgment of Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., 2001 (21) PTC 300 (SC)).",

It is common in the trade and business for a trader or a businessman to adopt a name and/or mark under which he would carry on his trade or business. According to Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading business or any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off will then lie wherever the defendant companys name, or its intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the proceedings. Where there is probability of confusion in business, an injunction will be granted even though the defendants adopted the name innocently.",

The law does not permit any one to carry on his business in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients in believing that the goods or services belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly,  honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name in connection with his business or services which already belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.”  (ii)  In the case of B.K.

At p. 218 Lord Searman said:  \"THE tort is no longer anchored, as in its early nineteenth century formulation, to the name or trade-mark of a product or business. It is wide  enough to encompass other descriptive material, such as slogans or visual images which radio, television or newspaper advertising campaigns can lead the market to associate with the plaintiff's product, provided always such descriptive material has become part of the goodwill of the product. And the test is whether the product has derived from the advertising a distinctive character which the market recognizes.\"  (iii)  Salmond & Heuston in Law of Torts (20th Edn., at p.395) call this form of injury as “injurious falsehood” and observe the same having been “awkwardly termed” as “passing off” says as under:  “The legal and economic basis of this tort is to provide protection for the right of property which exists not in a particular name, mark or style but in an established business, commercial or professional reputation or goodwill. So to sell merchandise or carry on business under such a name, mark, description, or otherwise in such a manner as to mislead the public into believing that the merchandise or business is that of another person is a wrong actionable at the suit of that other person. This form of injury is commonly, though awkwardly, termed that of passing off ones goods or business as the goods or business of another and is the most important example of the wrong of injurious falsehood. The gist of the conception of passing off is that the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about themselves, are saying something about themselves which is calculated to mislead. The law on this matter is designed to protect traders against that form of unfair competition which consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation already achieved by rival traders.”  (iv)  As per Kerly (Law on Trade Marks and Names, para 16.16) passing off cases are often cases of deliberate and intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a defence though proof of fraudulent intention may materially assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception. Christopher Wadlow in Law of Passing Off (1995 Edn., at p.3.06) states that the plaintiff does not have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing off.

However, it is also mentioned in the plaint that the plaintiff has been using the same in commercial manner and there was no prior-user of the same by third party prior to the plaintiff why the defendant should copy the same when defendant No.1 has admitted that he was earlier dealt with the plaintiff. The argument of the plaintiff mainly on the conduct of the defendants. It is submitted by the plaintiff that the defendants have intentionally and deliberately using the same in order to harm the business of the plaintiff and furnish the goodwill and reputation. It is also argued that it is often the hallmark of all the well known designers that they use different sources of inspiration to come up with a new collection. It is submitted that what has to be considered is the creative manner in  which the inspiration is used and the manner in which such designs are applied to the products. In order to create an aesthetic design, the creative team of the plaintiff company travels to different parts of the world to understand the various aspects of the theme, creates the mood board and then works on the design. It is admitted by the plaintiff company that it has cautiously taken inspirations from various sources including Mughal art and architecture, flaura and fauna, rich heritage of India etc. to create such aesthetic designs and such inspirations are only used to guide the designers to understand the theme. The plaintiff company also has placed on record the journals which depict the story and inspirations for each collection of the plaintiff. The creative team of the plaintiff company draws inspiration from different sources including Mughal art and architecture, flaura and fauna, etc in order to create such aesthetic designs, motifs and patterns. The said motifs, designs and patterns have been created by the creative team of the plaintiff company and every design has a story behind it while the same was being created.",

                        "content": "It is a well settled law that even though the design is old in itself but if the same is applied to a new article to which it has never been previously applied, then the said design needs to be protected. The law has been crystallized in a catena of judgments wherein the Courts have held that in relation designs, expression “original” includes designs which though old in themselves but were new in their application.  (a)  In Gammeter Vs. Controller of Patents and Designs (1918) ILR 45 Cal 606, the Court had held that the test that has to be  applied to see whether a design is new or original or not is that the design must be new or original with reference to the kind of article to which it is applied. In the said case, the novelty band used by the plaintiff was held to be new and original even though the said band was similar to the bracelet produced by the defendants as the Court was of the view that the purpose and use of the band was entirely different from the purpose and use of the bracelet. It was further observed that the said band had never been previously applied to wrist watches and the fact that it had an immediate and lucrative sale strongly indicates that the article sold was useful novelty. It was further observed that applying an old design to a new use must be protected. (Relevant paras 10, 11, 16 17).  (b)  In Gopal Glass Works vs Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs (2007) 1 Cal LT 290 (HC), the Court had observed that in order to destroy the novelty of a design registration whether by publication or use or any other way, must be of the pattern, shape and/or configuration applied to the same article. It was further observed that when the novelty of an article is tested against the prior published document, the main factor required to be judged is the visual effect and appeal of the picture illustration. Further, the Court held that such visual effect and appeal of the pattern and/or configuration must be considered in respect of the article to which it is applied. (Relevant paras 32 to 38 and 45 to 47).  (c)  In Bharat Glass Tube Limited v. Gopal Glass Works Limited AIR 2008 SC 2520, the Supreme Court had observed that the expression ‘new or original’ in the context of designs has to be construed that whether the said design has ever been produced by any third party on that particular article or not. It was held that in the registration of a design two things are required to be considered together i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article. (Relevant Paras 6, 8, 10, 13, 14).  (d)  In Asian Rubber Industries v. Jasco Rubber 2013 (1) Bom CR 393, Paras 3, 13, 14, 15 & 19, the defendants had challenged the validity of the design of the plaintiff on the ground that the said design of the footwear registered by the plaintiff was not new or original as the said design was developed from ‘Padukas’ which design has been commonly available since centuries. In the said case, the Court was of the view that the plaintiff is not claiming to be the inventor of ‘Padukas’ and is not claiming exclusivity by way of a patent right. However, the plaintiff is claiming exclusivity in the ‘Creative Expression’ and the ‘Look and Feel’ of their products. It was further observed that in the recent past, it is not known that the said look and feel of Padukas with the modification of strap to support the foot has been applied by any person to footwear. Thus, application of design of Padukas – of its ‘Look and Feel’, to footwear by the plaintiff in the recent past certainly falls within the meaning of ‘Original’ as defined in the Act and includes the cases which the  old and themselves yet are new in their application (Relevant paras 3, 13, 14, 15, 19).  (e)  In Shiv Prasad Ram Dayal vs. Shyamlal Bhagirath 1962 Cri LJ 551, the question that arose before the Court is that whether the general ‘get-up’ of the Katta of Bidis of the accused is a colorable imitation of the Katta of the complainant. The relevant portion of the said judgment is provided hereunder:  “In the instant case we have both the kattas of bidis before us and can decide for ourselves whether the general ‘get-up’ of the katta of the accused is a colourable imitation of the ‘Katta’ of the complainant. What is compendiously called the ‘get-up’, is the general size, shape and dress in which the goods are presented to the buyer. Size and shape are common to the trade as the Bidi kattas are usually packed in like size and shape. It is the dress the material, color and decoration of the wrapper, the motif of the trade mark label and its colour combination, the lettering and their arrangements which gives to the goods their individuality.  Here again we must remember that it is only things which are put forward prominently that catch the eye and remain in the memory. The details are forgotten or at most, may only be faintly recollected, but the general theme may impress the memory. For this purpose, we must also beat in mind that the bulk of the purchasers of the Bidis would be unlettered rustics to whom the lettering on the wrappers or the labels may be meaningless. It is only the bold motifs of the design and the colour combination that will impress on their minds. It would be too much to expect them to remember the exact details of the marks, letterings or numbers when there was a great overall similarity in the motifs and the colour combinations. Thus for  example as pointed by Kerly on Trademarks a mark may represent a game of football; another mark may show players in a different dress and in very different positions; and yet as the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football, one may be held to be a colourable imitation of the other. In Re Barker’s Trade Mark (1885) 53 LT 23, a firm of distillers registered as a trade mark for their Cherry Brandy, a hunting scene, in connection with the word ‘sportman’. Some years afterwards another firm of distillers registered a trade mark consisting oil a hunting scene having no resemblance with the former and called his Cherry Brandy ‘Huntsman Cherry Brandy’. Kays, J., notwithstanding the dissimilarity in the designs held that the latter trade mark was calculated to deceive.”",

Bombay Crockery House 1984 (4) PTC 102 (Del), the court restrained defendants’ mark TRISHUL PERFECT and VIJAY PERFECT because defendants, up to 1981, were stocking and selling the stores manufactured by the plaintiffs under plaintiffs’ registered trademark PERFECT and SWASTIK PERFECT. Defendants could thus easily pass off their goods as those of plaintiffs.  (ii)  A former partner of a firm or a servant who has left his employer may set up a similar business and advertise his previous connection, in the absence of any contract to the contrary. He should not, however, any representation amounting to a suggestion that he is still connected with the former firm or that he is their successor.  (iii)  In Pompadour Laboratories v. Stanley Frazer (1966) RPC 7, where the defendants had formerly been manufacturing hair lacquer for the plaintiffs, used the message “Frazer Chemicals have manufactured hair lacquer for Pampadour Laboratories Ltd. for several years” on the goods and advertisements, it was held that this did not amount to an assertion that the defendants’ goods were the goods of the plaintiffs.  (iv)  In Arthur Fairest v. Fairest (1949) 66 RPC 275 defendant, a former managing director of the plaintiff company set up a similar business and used one of the vouchers issued by the plaintiff company in which his name was printed as managing director. Injunction was granted restraining the defendant from using the  vouchers as it amounted to a representation that the business carried on by the defendant was connected with the plaintiff company.  (v)  In Glenny v. Smith (1865)2 Drew & Sm 476, defendant was an employee of the plaintiffs, Thresher, Glenny & Co. of 152, Strand. After leaving their service he opened a shop in Oxford Street and placed on the shop windows the words “from Thresher & Glenny”, the word ‘from’ being in very small letters. Injunction was granted to restrain the defendant from using the name of the plaintiffs.  (vi)  In the case of J.K. Jain and Ors. Vs. Ziff-Davies Inc. 2000 (56) DRJ 806, where the subject matter of the suit were four titles used with respect to magazines, the basis of the plaintiff's suit is that the defendants/appellants were its licensee for publishing computer magazine under the trade mark \"PC MAGAZINE INDIA\" under a license agreement. As per the license agreement the appellants specifically agreed and acknowledged the copyright and trade marks of the plaintiff, not to exercise its rights under the agreement or otherwise claim any right or interest in trademarks beyond the rights given in the agreement. After the license stood terminated, the defendants/appellants started publishing four magazines, contrary to the terms of license. The Court on the issue of whether the words \"PC\", \"WEEK\", \"MAGAZINE\", \"COMPUTER\", \"SHOPPER\", \"USER\", \"INTERNET\", are descriptive or general  words, observed that as an ex-licensee, appellants were estopped from claiming that the mark was descriptive since the appellants under the terms of the agreement were unable to challenge the proprietary rights of the respondents trade mark or trade name on any ground. It was held that after termination of the license the very act of the Defendant/Appellant in publishing the four titles is contrary to the terms of the licence.",

(i)  In the case of Vicco Laboratories v. Hindustan Rimmer, Delhi, reported at AIR 1979 Delhi 114 the case of the plaintiff before Court was that the plaintiffs have been marketing the cream in a collapsable tube of 3 different sizes which has the distinctive get up etc. The collapsable tube has red background with floral design in yellow colour under the trade mark ‘Vicco Turmeric Vanishing Cream’ in the carton as well as tube in yellow strip in the bottom. The case against the defendant was that they have been marketing the vanishing cream in the carton and tube which are a colourable immitation of the plaintiff’s carton and tube under the trade mark ‘Cosmo’. This court granted the injunction against the defendant and held at para 13 as under:- “The plaintiffs claim passing off by the defendants of their product as and for the product of the plaintiff’s on the basis of copy of the distinctive get up and colour scheme of the collapsible tubes and the cartons by them. The defendants are not entitled to represent their goods as being the goods of the plaintiffs. The two marks “Vicco” and “Cosmo” used by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively are no doubt different and the mark “Cosmo” by itself is not likely to deceive but the entire get up and the colour scheme of the tube and the carton adopted by the plaintiffs and the defendants are identical in every detail and are likely to confuse and deceive the customer easily. The get up and the colour scheme of the plaintiff'’ adopted in every detail by the defendants for their tube and carton cannot be said to have been adopted by the defendants unintentionally.\"  (ii)  In the case of Nova Ball Bearing Industries vs. Mico Ball Bearing, 19(1981) DLT 20, it has been held at para 7 as under:- “A comparison of the two cartons “NOVA” and “JANI” would reveal that two cartons are exactly similar in size, colour scheme and get up, the only difference that the trade mark of the defendants is written at 5 places and that of the plaintiff at 3 places. The two cartons bear such a close resemblance that they can easily confuse and deceive a customer.”  (iii)  In Cases and Material on Trade Mark and Allied Laws, Vol.I at Page No.969, Muller & Phipps International Corporation & another v. Anita Cosmetics & another, following observations are made at para 5 page No.971:- “It is true that the use of the mark COUNTESS by itself is not likely to deceive the customers. But if the two containers CUTICURA and COUNTESS are put side by side, it becomes apparent that in the get up, colour scheme and the similarity the containers are so similar that they easily confuse and deceive the customers. The defendant No.1 has adopted the get up and colour scheme of the container to the plaintiffs’ in every detail and they are identical in appearance.”  (iv)  In the case of Sodastream v. Thorn cascade Co Ltd., reported at 1982 RPC 459, the plaintiffs were marketing the gas cylinders of grey colour under their trade mark ‘Sodastream’ and the defendants having also been marketing their black colour cylinders under their own trade mark ‘Thorn Cascade’, the proposals of the defendants to refill the grey colour gas cylinders of the plaintiff, even with their own trade mark amounts to passing off as the grey colour cylinder is distinctive of the plaintiffs in respect of which the reputation accrued in favour of the plaintiffs. Interlocutory injunction granted.  (v)  In another case reported in 1972 RPC 1, Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. A.G. v. D.D.S.A. Pharmaceuticals Limited, the plaintiffs manufactured and marketed chlordiazepoxide in distinctive black and green capsules bearing the word “Roche” on each capsule, the defendants also marked and advertised the drug chlordiazepoxide in black and green 10mg capsules which were identical to those of the plaintiffs except that they bore the letters “DDSA” instead of the plaintiffs’ name. The plaintiffs were granted interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from passing off capsules of the patented drug as the goods of the plaintiffs. It was held that marketing of the capsules by the defendants is almost identical to those of the plaintiffs was calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs. It was further held that there was a likelihood of confusion as both the capsules contained the same drug. The public were not concerned with the identity of the manufacturing of the capsules as long as the capsules contained the same substance and had the same effect.",

According to Karly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (9th Edn., para 838):  “Two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person acquainted with one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the  second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted. Thus, for example, a mark may represent a game of football; another mark may show players in a different dress, and in very different positions, and yet the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football. It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trade marked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own.”",

The defendants have failed to assign any explanation as to why they have adopted and used the product in similar designs for commercial purposes and in relation to the same business. Therefore, the interim order pertaining to the same is made absolute by disposing of both interim applications. As the products used by the defendants in relation to the design of Lotus and Bali Mynah is concerned, the design of the product are dissimilar substantially, the ex-parte order is accordingly vacated pertaining to them. However, the defendant is restrained from using the titles Bali Mynah and Rose Princess in relation to the similar business as that  of the plaintiff. However, they are entitled to use the said titles in respect of different activities and unconnected field of activities. With regard to Periyar design, the use of the same is given by the defendants during the course of arguments.",

The plaintiff is, therefore, allowed to give his own tentative valuation. Ordinarily the Court shall not examine the correctness of the valuation chosen, but the plaintiff cannot act arbitrarily in this matter. If a plaintiff chooses whimsically a ridiculous figure it is tantamount to not exercising his right in this regard.

The Court has held:  “No doubt law provides that in case of relief for rendition of account when the amount is not ascertained the plaintiff cannot be asked to give a specific and ascertained figure of the amount on which relief is sought in the suit.

Under Sec. 47 of the Patents Act, 1970, the grant of a patent is subject to certain conditions under sub-clause 1. One of them being, that a patent granted for any machine, apparatus or process may be imported or made by or on behalf of the government for its own use.

(O.S.) 1098/2008 :  “The general rule in regard to impleadment of parties is that the plaintiff in a suit, being dominus litis, may choose the persons against whom he wishes to litigate and cannot be compelled to sue a person against whom he does not seek any relief. Consequently, a person who is not a party has no right to be impleaded against the wishes of the plaintiff. But this general rule is subject to the provisions of Order 1 Rule 10(2) of Code of Civil Procedure ('Code' for short), which provides for impleadment of proper or necessary parties. The said provision makes it clear that a court may, at any stage of the proceedings (including suits for specific performance), either upon or even without any application, and on such terms as may appear to it to be just, direct that any of the following persons may be added as a party: (a) any person who ought to have been joined as plaintiff or defendant, but not added; or (b) any person whose presence before the court may be necessary in order to enable the court to effectively and completely adjudicate upon and settle the question involved in the suit. In short, the court is given the discretion to add as a party, any person who is found to be a necessary party or proper party. A 'necessary party' is a person who ought to have been joined as a party and in whose  absence no effective decree could be passed at all by the Court. If a 'necessary party' is not impleaded, the suit itself is liable to be dismissed.” (emphasis supplied)",

The question under reference rather invites the construction of Section 22 of the Design Act, 2000 so as to discern whether it permits a suit for infringement of Design by a registered proprietor against the another registered proprietor. The connected question which is required to be answered is more of the nature and characteristic of the monopoly right which is purely conferred by the Statute (which only upon the grant of the certificate provides some valuable rights including the right to sue for infringement) and under these circumstances, whether the registered proprietor of the Design can proceed to sue against another registered proprietor who is enjoying the same privilege by virtue of registration? In my opinion, the answers of both the questions are in negative considering the language of Section 22 of the Design Act in which the said Section has been couched and also considering the scheme of the Act.",

(2)  If any person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be liable for every contravention- (a)  to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a sum not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees recoverable as a contract debt, or  (b)  if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery of damages for any such contravention, and for an injunction against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages as may be awarded and to be restrained by injunction accordingly:  Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one design under clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand rupees:  Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for relief under this sub-section shall be instituted in any court below the court of District Judge.  (3)  In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19 shall be available as a ground of defence.  (4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the second proviso to sub-section (2), where any ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19 has been availed of as a ground of defence and sub-section (3) in any suit or other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), the suit or such other proceeding shall be transferred by the court, in which the suit or such other proceeding is pending, to the High Court for decision.  (5)  When the court makes a decree in a suit under sub-section (2), it shall send a copy of the decree to the Controller, who shall cause an entry thereof to be made in the register of designs.  Section 11. Copyright on registration.-(1) When a design is registered, the registered proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have copyright in the design during ten years from the date of registration.

                        "content": "The Scheme of the Section 22 (1) itself reveals that the rights which are conferred upon the design right holder are not to be exercised by \"any person\" other than a registered proprietor are provided under Section 22(1) of the Act and it shall not be lawful such person to apply the said designs else the consequences for contravention as provided under Section 22(2) of the Act shall follow. This construction of the wordings “any person” can be deduced by the careful reading of Section 22 and the reasons for non inclusion of the registered proprietor within its ambit are enumerated as under:  i)  Firstly, the language of the Section 22(1) is such which begins with the opening words “during the existence of copyright in any design”, it shall not lawful for any person to do the acts without the consent of the registered proprietor. The said Section 22 (1) by virtue of its very language presupposes two participants one being the registered proprietor and another being any person for whom, it shall not be lawful to do the acts as defined in sub-section 22 (1) is such “any person” without the consent of the registered proprietor. The language employed under Section 22 (1) nowhere permits a registered proprietor of the subsequent design to fit into ambit of Section 22 (1). The said “any person” has to be person other than the registered proprietor for whom, the said acts are unlawful without the consent of the registered proprietor. The person who is the registered proprietor himself cannot do unlawful act for applying the design and for whom the consent of the another registered proprietor is not the sine qua non as his entitlement stands at par with the first registered proprietor. Therefore, “any person” as stated in the Section 22 (1) has to be a person other than a registered proprietor. Any other view, would be doing injustice to the express wordings of the statute.  ii)  Subsection (2) of Section 22 has an immediate nexus with sub section (1), if the said any person does not fit within the purview of subsection (1), it cannot be said that the said “any person” shall contravene the provisions of sub-section (1), which would entitle him to the consequences provided under sub-section (2). All this would mean that once a registered proprietor of the design not fall within the purview of  “any person”, then it is inconceivable as to how he is found to violating the provisions of sub-section (1).  iii)  Here, the opportunity comes to analyze Section 22(3) also as it is generally understood that the courts are empowered to examine the correctness of the design certificate in an infringement proceedings. Let me therefore also have a look at Section 22(3) which reads as under:- “Section 22 (3) In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19 shall be available as a ground of defence.”  A careful reading of sub section (3) would reveal that the opening words of the section provide for the conditions for the applicability of the said sub section (3), the said conditions are in any suit or proceeding for relief under sub section (2), thus for the applicability of the sub section (3), the suit or the proceeding must relate to one contained under sub section (2) relating to contravention. It passes human comprehension as to when the registered proprietor does not fall within in the ambit of sub section (1), not found violating the sub section (1) under subsection (2), then how the provisions of sub section (3) are applicable in a case where there is one registered proprietor is suing another registered proprietor. If the infringement action itself is not maintainable as per the provisions contained in section 22 (1) and 22(2), where lies the opportunity to consider the invalidity of the registration of the said registered proprietor as the defendant under the provisions of sub section (3) of Section 22.  iv)  The court in such a case if proceeds to invalidate the said registered design right of the defendant by invoking Section 22 (3) would have to presuppose that there exists any such legal right to sue against the registered right holder when there exists none in law. Thus, Section 22 (3) cannot be given interpretation wider in amplitude to operate in a field for which it is not even enacted. By doing this would mean, judicial legislation of the enactment, which is impermissible in law.  v)  The question is not the suit is based on the uniqueness or newness of the design but the legal right to sue. If the suit is entertained for infringement against another registered proprietor, the court has to presuppose that there is any right in common law which entitles the court to conduct such enquiry as to invalidity of the registered design of the Defendant, when the language employed in the section no where permits a registered proprietor to be included within the ambit of the words “any person”. Such presupposing of the right in common law as if both the parties are before the court to prove the novelty and originality and whosoever succeeds in the same shall entitle for monopoly rights conferred by the statute no where exists. The creation of the said right to test the validity of the registered design of the Defendant in common law would be contrary to the nature and characteristic of Design right which is purely a monopoly conferred by statute and was never protected in common law which is akin to patent.  vi)  The occasion to test prima facie validity of the defendant’s design arises only when the right to sue exists at the first place as per Section 22 (1) and (2). In the absence of the said right created by the special statute, no a priori assumption of invalidity can be drawn and enquiry as to invalidity of the said design registration by the civil court shall be a jurisdictional error as Section 22 no where permits the same.  vii)  From the afore narrated pointers, it can be safely said that neither the plain reading of section 22 suggests that the registered proprietor can be subsumed within the meaning of “any person” nor the nature of monopoly permit any additional right to sue enabling the court to conduct the exercise of forming a prima facie opinion as to invalidity of the another registered proprietor’s design as defendant. Under these circumstances, it is doubtful as to how the suit for infringement can be maintained against another registered proprietor.  Let me now evaluate the submissions of the learned counsels for the plaintiff. Much emphasis has been laid by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the use of the expression “any person” under Section 22 of the Designs Act would tend to include a registered proprietor especially when  the continuing words “other than the registered proprietor” are missing. This argument is sought to be fortified by the argument that the courts are empowered to test the validity of the registered design in the infringement proceedings as per Section 22 (3) and therefore it is sought to be argued that the term “any person” cannot be given a narrow construction but should necessarily include the registered proprietor considering that the design registration nowhere involves examination process and limiting the scope of court’s interference would, in fact, undermine the monopoly rights.",

Thus, the courts have limited power to cancellation to test the validity in an infringement proceedings under sub-section (2) of the Section 22 of Design Act when the grounds of invalidity is taken as a ground of defence and not otherwise.

Taylor and has held as under: \"The rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor (3) is well recognised and is founded on sound principle. Its result is (1) I.L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488. (2) L.R. 63 IA. 372. (3) [1875] 1 Ch. D. 426, 431 that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act and has laid down the method in which that power has to be exercised, it necessarily prohibits the doing of the act in any other manner than that  which has been prescribed. The principle behind the rule is that if this were not so, the statutory provision might as well not have been enacted. A magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of investigation record a confession except in the manner laid down in Section 164. The power to record the confession had obviously been given so that the confession might be proved by the record of it made in the manner laid down. If proof of the confession by other means was permissible, the whole provision of Section 164 including the safeguards contained in it for the protection of accused persons would be rendered nugatory. The section, therefore, by conferring on magistrates the power to record statements or confessions, by necessary implication, prohibited a magistrate from giving oral evidence of the statements or confessions made to him.

But after the amendment and enactment of 2000 Act, as per the Design Act, 2000, the powers to hear cancellation vests before the Controller General of Designs and the High Court powers are in a away divested to hear cancellation petition except to the extent of hearing the challenges to the validity as a defence to the infringement proceeds. The rest of the powers to entertain cancellation are taken away by the Act of 2000. Once, the said powers are divested from this court by way of amendments carried out in 2000 and the controller is exclusively invested with such powers, it would be unwise to assume that the similar powers subsists with the civil court when the civil court has been retained with limited power to examine the validity in the cases where infringement suit is maintainable at the first place.  In the case of East India Corporation Ltd. Vs. Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd., 1991 SCR (2) 310, the Supreme Court observed that the when there exists an act which empowers the specialized tribunal to do the act and entertain a remedy and the Act is self contained code on the conferment of its remedies and rights, then the civil court jurisdiction to entertain the suit though not expressly barred but to the extent the jurisdiction is vested with the specialized tribunal can be implicitly barred if the Act is clear about the remedies provided under it and entrust the same to the tribunals. In the words of the Supreme Court, it was observed thus:  “Section 10 of the Act, as seen above, prohibits eviction of a tenant whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of that Section or Sections 14 to 16. These provisions as well as the other provisions of the Act  are a self-contained code, regulating the relationship of parties, creating special rights and liabilities, and, providing for determination of such rights and liabilities by tribunals constituted under the statute and whose orders are endowed with finality. The remedies provided by the statute in such matters are adequate and complete. Although the statute contains no express bar of jurisdiction of the civil Court, except for eviction of tenants in execution or otherwise, the provisions of the statute are clear and complete in regard to the finality of the orders passed by the special tribunals set up under it, and their competence to administer the same remedy as the civil Courts render in civil suits. Such tribunals having been so constituted as to act in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure, the clear and explicit intendment of the Legislature is that all questions relating to the special rights and liabilities created by the statute should be decided by the tribunals constituted under it. Although the jurisdiction of the civil Court is not expressly barred, the provisions of the statute explicitly show that, subject to the extraordinary powers of the High Court and this Court, such jurisdiction is impliedly barred, except to the limited extent specially provided by the statute.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

As such, the courts once faced with an infringement action can draw an inference as to invalidity and proceed with the infringement action on the basis of the invalidity of the said registered design. I find that the said contention is without any substance. The reason is simple which is that when the courts are conferred with a limited power to test the validity of the design only within the bounds of Section 22 (3) and not otherwise.

In the case of the present nature, the remedy itself is not provided under Section 22 (1) and (2) as the registered proprietor on true and plain construction of the provision does not fit within the ambit of the any person, thus, there is no reason to draw any such inferences at the place where there lies no remedy.",

The answer to the reference of question (1) is done in negative.  In end of the answer to the question No. 1, I would also like to address one more argument which has been raised by the counsel for the parties in order to support the view that this court should permit the suit by the one registered proprietor against another which is that the Design registrations are subjected to low level of the scrutiny before the Designs office and the said designs are granted quite easily by the Designs office. Therefore, this court’s ruling that the suit for infringement would not be maintainable against the registered proprietor would affect the registered proprietors adversely as the Designs are actually and in reality tested in the court of law. Thus, this court should take the view that the suit for infringement is maintainable against the another registered proprietor.

The key answer to the said question under reference is also not that solely because there is a reference of a kind of dual protection in the field of Design law and Trade Mark Law so far as shape of the articles are concerned in the authorities emanating from US and some in UK, the same should be followed as such in Indian law overlooking the avowed object and scheme of the Designs Act, 2000. For answering the said question Nos.2 and 3 under  the reference, there are some connected questions which are required to be answered which will enable this court to answer the reference. The said questions are; what is true nature of action which is based on passing off right and the Design right?; Whether the said action of passing off is available as remedy in the absence of any saving or preservation of the common law right under the Design Act?; Whether the objects and the legislative intent of Designs Act in India which are aimed at protection for limited period with no further extension permit any such extension of the monopoly rights in perpetuity by adopting the route of passing off thereby protecting the same very shape of article which was or is the subject matter of protection under Design Act? Whether the right available in the trade marks can be joined with the Design right which is mutually inconsistent with each other? I propose to answer the said very questions arising in the instant reference under the larger head of the question Nos. 2 and 3.",

First and foremost enquiry amongst the same is the true nature and characteristic of the Design Right. The Design right is a limited monopoly right conferred by a statute for an industrial article which has been used for commerce. The said right has been created by the framers of the law by enacting a separate enactment with a explicit intent that the articles containing the novel shapes and designs which are put into commerce but though also aesthetic in nature enjoy lesser monopoly than the ordinary Copyright. The Design right being purely an statutory right has its genesis in patents and is equated with a patent rights, however due to the aesthetic and ornamental features which  designable subject matter bears, the said right is called as Copyright in the Design. The said Design right is akin to patent right which has been seen below which becomes a basis to understand why the extension of monopoly over the designable subject matter is detrimental to the public policy and also against the underlying object of the Act.",

In the words of Author, it has been observed thus:- “51.4 A registered design is a statutory monopoly of up to 25 years duration, which is intended to give protection to the appearance, but not the function, of the whole or part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture and / or materials of the product and/ or its ornamentation…….”  “51.6 A proprietor of a registered design and certain licenses can bring proceedings for infringement against any third party who uses the design or any design which does not produce a different overall impression on the informed user. This applies to designs registered before the amendment of the  RDA 1949 ( Registered Designs Act) by the 2001 Regulations as well as to designs applied for is that the latter can be enforced against a third party who has not copied the proprietor‟s design. It is a true monopoly which is similar in many respects to a patent monopoly.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

However, the Designs Act was always the part of Patents Act earlier. The said design right is considered as privilege of the sovereign just like patents. The tests for evaluating the novelty in patents as well as the designs are same. The legislative history of Indian Design law reads as under:    The first legislation in India for protection of Industrial Designs was The Patents & Designs Protection Act, 1872. It supplemented the 1859 Act passed by Governor General of India for granting exclusive privileges to inventors and added protection for Industrial Design. The 1872 Act included the term ―any new and original pattern or design, or the application of such pattern or design to any substance or article of manufacture.    The Inventions & Designs Act of 1888 re-enacted the law relating to protection of inventions and designs and contained provision relating to Designs in a separate part.    The Patents & Designs Act enacted in 1911 also provided for protection of Industrial Designs.    The Patents Act, 1970 repealed the provisions of the Patents and Designs Act, 1911, so far as they related to Patents. However, the provisions relating to Designs were not repealed and continued to govern the Designs Law.    India joined the WTO as a ―member State in 1995. Consequently, the Patents & Designs Act, 1911 was repealed and the Designs Act, 2000 was enacted, to make the Designs Law in India TRIPS compliant. The definition of “design” in the Designs Act, 2000 is more or less the same as that of the 1911 Act. Novelty under the 1911 Act was determined with reference to India, whereas under the Designs Act, 2000 novelty is determined on a global basis.",

They are the bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be read, first as a whole and then section by section, clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute maker, provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context. With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.

The statement of object has been firstly considered by learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Microfibres Inc. Vs. Girdhar & Co. & Anr., 128 (2006) DLT 238 while answering the question as to whether the monopoly rights granted under the Design Act for a limited period can be extended by switching over the rights to Copyright Act. By answering the question in negative and applying Section 15 which clearly debars the same, the learned Single Judge observed thus:  “In order to appreciate the object of introduction of the new Designs Act of 2000, various proceedings were referred to by learned counsel for the defendants. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of The Designs Bill, 1999 provided that the intent was to ensure that the law does not unnecessarily extend protection beyond what is necessary to create the required incentive for design activity while removing impediments to the very use of available designs. The definition of 'design' has been amplified to incorporate therein the composition of line and colours so as to avoid overlapping with the Copyright Act regarding definition of 'design' in respect of 'artistic work'.  The proceedings from the Parliamentary Debate on the Bill were also referred to show that the concerned Minister of State had observed that the Act was being amended to 'provide help and protecting the rights of designers'.” (Emphasis Supplied)  “Furthermore, the legislative intent is also to be kept in mind which is to provide protection for a certain period of time for commercial exploitation. Thus, nature of protection is quite different for an artistic work under the Copyright Act which is for the lifetime of the author/creator + 60 years. This is not so in the case of commercial exploitation as under the Designs Act and the Patent Act the period is much lesser.

This is evident from the fact that Controller of Patents and Designs remains the same. The High Court is also the same which is High Court as defined in the Patents Act, 1970. The provisions of Patent Act, 1970 are applicable to the Designs Act as extended provisions. The Patent Agent is deemed to be the agent practicing before the Designs Office. The evidence certified by the Patents Office shall be admitted in the Court of law. The provisions relating to cancellation of design is similar to that of the patent. The tests relating to evaluation of novelty in Design is also the ones relating to Patents. The said composite scheme of Designs Act, 2000 clearly leads to a conclusion that the design monopoly though named differently as “copyright in design”, but it has trappings of patent so far as the nature and characteristic of the right is concerned. The said conclusion by fair reading of Designs Act being akin to patent is once read with the avowed objective of Designs Act wherein one of the objects is that to confer a limited monopoly right which should not unnecessarily be extended makes it crystal-clear that after the expiration of design right, the treatment of the said monopoly conferred by the design right shall be the same as that of patents which is that after expiration of design right, the same shall go to the public domain as in the cases of patent and in case, the said monopoly is extended, the same shall be contrary to the objects and scheme of Designs Act.",

                        "content": "Now, given the avowed object of the Designs Act and the legislative policy behind the Act of 2000, the question arises whether the amendments made in the 1999 Act of Trade Marks which include the Shape of the goods under the definition of the mark as per Section 2(1) (m) change the position in the said policy and also whether the monopoly rights under the Design Act can be extended on the availability of the remedy of the passing off by way of amendments carried out under the Trade Mark Act which can lead to a protection of the same subject matter doubly. The answer to the said questions is in negative. This is due to the following reasons:  I.  The amendments carried out in Trade Mark Act were done in the year 1999 though the Act were notified in the year 2003. The Design Act was drafted in the year 2000. The said Design Act was a later enactment of 2000. Still, the legislative policy and the object behind the passing the Act remains the same which is to grant the limited monopoly rights and not to extend the same so that the public could use the same freely.  It is well established principle of law that when there is inconsistency between two special laws operating in their respective fields, the conflict between the same has to be resolved by seeing objects behind the two special laws and interpretation must be devised so that both should operative and serve their relevant objects.  The said proposition was laid down in the case of Ashoka Marketing Limited and Anr. Vs. Punjab National Bank and Others (AIR 1991 SC 855) wherein the Supreme Court observed thus:  “In other words, both the enactments, namely, the Rent Control Act and the Public Premises Act, are special statutes  in relation to the matters dealt with therein. Since, the Public Premises Act is a special statute and not a general enactment the exception contained in the principle that a subsequent general law cannot derogate from an earlier special law cannot be invoked and in accordance with the principle that the later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws, the Public Premises Act must prevail over the Rent Control Act. The principle which emerges from these decisions is that in the case of inconsistency between the provisions of two enactments, both of which can be regarded as Special in nature, the conflict has to be resolved by reference to the purpose and policy underlying the two enactments and the clear intendment conveyed by the language of the relevant provisions therein. We propose to consider this matter in the light of this principle” (Emphasis Supplied)  Applying the said principle of law to the instant case, the legislative policy provided in the later enactment Design Act, 2000 was to confer the limited monopoly rights which should not be unnecessary extended so that public can freely use the said shapes and designs in the commerce. This object was kept in mind ever after making the amendments in the Trade Mark Act, 1999. Thus, the Design Act shall be continued to be guided by the same policy as contained in the statement of objects and reasons contained therein in the later Act. Accordingly, the legislative policy under the later enactment of 2000 cannot be abrogated when the legislature consciously devised the said policy even after making the amendments in the Trade Marks Act in the year 1999.  II.  Once the objects of the Design Act, 2000 provides that the monopoly rights are for limited period and the same should not be extended so that public can freely use the shape of the articles, the further extension of the rights under the guise of the passing off by calling it a dual monopoly would be against the policy and the purpose behind the Designs Act which is to make the shape of the articles in public domain for free use after expiration. It cannot be the case that on one hand the shape of the article is passed to public domain for free use by operation of law of Design Act and on the other hand, the same very shape is again taken away from the public and put into the bracket of the protection by granting monopoly rights in perpetuity by operation of another law which is a prior law and thereby in effect the public is debarred from using the said shape of the articles. The same cannot be legislative intent behind conferring the rights under the Trade Marks Act which would invariably be advantageous only to the particular class of the proprietors and which would also militate against the legislative policy of special law holding the field of Designs.  III.  The grant of the further monopoly rights under the guise of the passing off to the shape of the article even after the expiry of the Design would make the Design Act redundant or nugatory or otiose. This is due to the reason that proprietors who have already enjoyed the statutory right to exclude others which is equivalent to patents would be granted further monopoly rights which are inconsistent with the Design right provided under the Design Act by making their registration and the rights conferred as inconsequential.  IV.  The monopoly rights of the Design and Trade mark are mutually inconsistent with each other. This is due to the manner in which Trade Mark and Design rights operate, their nature, characteristic, policies behind the two laws and many other ways. The said differences can be enumerated as under:  a.  Where as the remedy under the Trade Marks Act is statutory as well as equitable in nature as it saves common law remedy, the rights and remedies under the Design Act are purely statutory in nature based on the strict word of statute.  b.  The rights under the Trade Mark Act are based on securing registration as well as rights exists in common law by way of prior user which may lead to distinctiveness of the mark in question in market. Unlike, the Trade Marks Act, the rights in Design Act are conferred only if the design is novel on the date of application as well as original. The said aspect of novelty is akin to law of patents which states that the invention must not be disclosed to public or pre published piece of art. Thus, whereas in Trade Marks Act prior user confers rights in common law; in Design Act is completely inconsistent in nature where prior user from the date of application destroys the rights as the same may lead pre publication in the eyes of the law.  c.  Trade Marks are Registered for the period of 10 years and are renewable thereafter for the further period of 10 years each time they are due for renewal. Thus, there is no limitation on the period of trade marks to remain in force. The same also holds good for trade marks rights exist in common law. The only  exception to the same is when the court declares that due to the long and extensive usage of the said mark, the said mark has become generic. On the other hand, the Design is registered for 10 years and further renewed for one more term of 5 years and in that way, the said right under the Design is for the limited period of time.  d.  Passing off right is saved by Trade Marks Act and not saved by Design Act.  e.  Validity of trade mark right cannot be seriously questioned by urging in defence in an infringement action under the Trade Marks Act (except on the limited grounds permitted by the Act and for the rest, there is a cancellation action under Section 57 which is available under the Act). On the other hand, every ground of cancellation under the Design Act is permissible to be urged as a defence to an infringement action by virtue of Section 22 (3) read with Section 19 of Designs Act.  V.  It is true that the definition of mark under Section 2 (1) (m) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides shape of the goods as marks, however, it is equally to be looked into that Designs Act of 2000 under Section 2(d) while defining design expressly excludes the trademark within the meaning of Section 2(1) (v) of Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 which after the repeal shall be corresponding definition of Trade Marks Act 1999. All this would mean that there is an express exclusion under the Designs Act anything which is capable of being trademark.  Therefore, a proprietor by electing to go for registering a design explicitly forecloses his right to claim the said article as a trademark which is evident from the definition of Design under Section 2(d) of Designs Act. In the case of M/s Ampro Food Products (Appellant) Vs. M/s Ashoka Biscuit Works and Ors (Respondents) AIR 1973 Andhra Pradesh page 17 which was passed in the old Designs Act containing similar exclusion, Hon’ble Justice Chinnappa Reddy (as he then was) held that design is different from a Trademark as by approaching the authority of Design Office a person has to declare that nothing contained therein is trademarkable. In the words of Hon’ble Justice Chinnappa Reddy it was observed thus:- “4. The respondent, it seems has applied for the registration of a trademark and Mr. Babulal Reddy, learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the application will be granted as a matter of course. Assuming so, I do not see how that will entitle the respondent to commit an act of piracy in regard to the appellant‟s registered design. It should be remembered that a trademark is different from a design. A design is necessarily part and parcel of the article manufactured while a trademark is not necessarily so. In fact, the definition of “design” in Section 2(5) of the Designs Act expressly states that it does not include any trade mark as defined in Section 2(1)(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. That is why the certificate of registration of the design contains a note which recites “The novelty in the design resides in the ornamental source pattern which appears only on the side of the biscuit as illustrated. No claim is made by virtue of this registration to any right to the use as a trademark of what is shown in the representations or to the  exclusive use of the letters appearing in the design.” This note does not give any right to the respondent or other biscuit manufacturer to commit an act of piracy of the design as defined in the Designs Act under the guise of using it as a trade mark. The respondent or other biscuit manufacturer may perhaps use the design as a trade mark on a wrapper or a label or otherwise but not so as to make it part and parcel of the biscuit in which case he could be committing an act of piracy of the design as defined in the Designs Act.” [Emphasis laid]",

One has to really go into more depth in order to understand and comprehend why such judgments are passed by the courts of the respective jurisdictions. In UK, the policy behind protection of design has undergone a significant change after much lobbying created by the proprietors which persuaded the British Parliament to pass legislations like Unregistered Designs Act where the designs are even protected in common law. Further, the Design Law in UK has been amended number of times and each time there is a shift in the legislative intent which has gone forward towards the protection and extension of the monopoly one way or other. Initially, the judgments passed by the UK courts took the consistent view which was also in consonance with their legislative policy as it then existed in UK which is also present in India under the current scenario which was not to extend the monopoly rights under the Design Act.  The Decision of House of Lords in the case of Re Coca-Cola Co.‟s Application, [1986] 2 All ER 274 the House of Lords speaking through lord Tempelman observed that an attempt to register the shape of the Coca-Cola bottle was “another attempt to expand on the boundaries of intellectual property and to convert a protective law into a source of monopoly.” The said view was also taken in the further decisions of UK. However, the amendments carried out in the Designs Act of UK from time to time and change the legislative policy also had an impact on the decisions of the Court. All this is evident from the legislative history behind the Designs Act as it was amended from time to time in England.",

                        "content": "The legislative history and the change in policy coupled with European Community Directives which were passed would itself narrate how the registered design law as it exists in UK is different in policy and object than that of Indian Designs Act, 2000. the changes made in the design law in UK can be sub categorized under the three heads which will enable a person to understand the changes in the policy made in UK that started as a fine distinction between the two monopoly rights that Designs Act and Copyright Act are completely distinct from each other and thereafter the link was established between the Registered Design and common law in order to undermine the characteristic of statutory nature of Design right. The effect of this policy change is that the shape of industrial commercial articles which were earlier aimed at giving a limited monopoly of 15 years due to its putting into commerce was extended either by giving a full copyright protection of 60 years in certain cases or in the alternative protected under the law of passing off by calling it as trade mark or trade dress. Such was never the original intent of the framers of the design law  but still due to peculiar circumstances existing in UK and in European countries, the said policy change was adopted and implemented in the national legislations. The said three heads by which one can discern the change and evolution of policy of dual protection in UK Design Law can be enumerated as under:-   Law prior to the year 1989-Prior to 1989, the copyright law in UK was governed by 1911 Act and thereafter the Copyright Act of 1956. Both the Acts provided that the copyright rights and the design rights are totally distinct in nature. The articles which are registrable under the Designs Act are given a limited monopoly rights and as such cannot be given copyright protection (Kindly see Section 10 of UK Copyright Act of 1956 and also see Section 22 of UK Copyright Act of 1911). The design law in UK was governed by the Registered Designs Act, 1949 which also confers a statutory monopoly upon the articles having novel shape and configuration. At that point of time when there was a clear legislative policy that Designs Act was passed with the aim to confer the limited monopoly rights to the proprietor and the same is distinct from that of copyright and it can never be extended. The judicial view which was prevalent at that point of time also supported the same conclusion.    In the case of Coca-Cola Co‟s, [1986] 2 All ER 274. It was observed by Lord Templeman, thus:- It is not sufficient for the Coca-Cola bottle to be distinctive. The Coca-Cola Co. must succeed in the startling proposition that the bottle is a trademark. If so, then any other container or any article of a distinctive shape is capable of being a trade mark. This raises the spectre of a total and perpetual monopoly in  containers and articles achieved by means of the 1939 Act. Once the container or article has become associated with the manufacturer and distinctiveness has been established, with or without the help of the monopolies created by the Patent Act, the Registered Designs Act or the Copyright Act, the perpetual trademark monopoly in the container or article can be achieved. In my opinion the 1938 Act was not intended to confer on the manufacturer of a container or on the manufacture of an article a statutory monopoly on the ground that the manufacturer has in the eyes of the public established a connection between the shape of the container or article and the manufacturer. A rival manufacturer must be free to sell any container or article or similar shape provided the container or article is labeled or packaged in a manner which avoids confusion as to the origin of the goods in the container or the origin of the article.”(Emphasis Supplied)  Likewise, in the case of Catnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith & Co [1978] FSR 405, Chancery Division of United Kingdom was concerned with the question whether by claiming a corresponding patent protection in the embodiment and disclosing the industrial drawing before the Patent Office, Can monopoly rights in the drawings be claimed under the Copyright in order to prevent the manufacture of industrial article basing upon the said drawing? Answer to this question is in negative. Whitford J. took the view that on the expiry of Patent there must be an implied licence covering any use of patent drawings and all other drawings on which the articles were based. In his popular speech which is often quoted by the courts of law in UK and in India, it was observed thus:- “In my view, by applying for a patent and accepting the statutory obligation to describe and if necessary illustrate embodiments of his invention, a patentee necessarily makes an election accepting that, in return for a potential monopoly, upon publication, the material disclosed by him in the [patent] specification must be  deemed open to be used by the public, subject only to such monopoly rights as he may acquire on his application for the patent and during the period for which his monopoly remains in force, whatever be the reason for the determination of the monopoly rights. If this be correct… upon publication the plaintiffs must be deemed to have abandoned their copyright in drawings the equivalent of the patent drawings” (Emphasis Supplied)    From the above, it is clear that the underlying policy prior to 1988 and 1989 prevalent in UK was to prevent extension of monopoly rights; be it copyright vis-à-vis design; designs vis-à-vis trade marks or in the alternative patent vis-à-vis copyright. There were contrary views which were taken in between by the courts below, however, the most popular ones which are often cited in India by the Superior Courts of England and denotes correct exposition of law has been discussed above.    Law after the year 1989-In the year 1988, the copyright and design laws in UK were amended which have brought change in the policy underlying the design law. In the book titled as Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis, the learned Author has noted the changes which were brought by 1988 amendments in the following words:- “43.5 This whole area of law was the subject of fundamental reform in 1988. The major features of the changes are as follows:- (1)  registered design legislation was amended, in particular to make registration more attractive by extending the life of the monopoly to a maximum of 25 years;  (2)  a new right was created to give some protection to those who designed novel articles, even if they were functional. This is called „design right‟.  (3)  the law of copyright was modified, inter alia, to remove industrial designs from its ambit; and  (4)  transitional provisions were put in place in respect of copyright which reduced the protection for industrial designs and abolished conversion damages.” [Emphasis supplied]",

                        "content": "From the reading of above, the position as it then existed in 1988 clarified the intentions of framers of law and policy which was to extend the monopoly rights in the commerce and industrially exploited articles in one way or the other. The life time of monopoly of design was extended and new right was created which is called design right which was actually an unregistered design right in order to undermine the statutory nature of the registered designs right. The unregistered design right conferred monopoly even to the shapes of functional articles for the period of 25 years. However, changes made in the year 1988 were just miniscule in nature as the policy governing even at that point of time was that though the design rights were extended monopoly of 25 years and additional design right was created but the intention was always to keep the design right and copyright distinct from each other.    Learned Author in his Book Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis summarizes the said changes brought by Copyright, Design and Patent Acts of 1988 in the following manner:- “43.31… The CDPA 1988 thus served the link between protection by means of copyright and by registered design and  instead created a link between protection by unregistered design right and/ or by copyright.”    From the reading of aforementioned observations, it is clear that the legislative changes were brought in the copyright regime wherein there was another right called Design Right which was created and the link between the copyright and unregistered design right was established which created room in the law for protection of design irrespective of their registration even in common law. (Emphasis Supplied)    With the enactment of Copyright, Design and Patent Act of 1988 in UK, some transitional provisions were inserted in the said Copyright Act which also affected the enforcement of copyright in the registrable designs. The said transitional provisions were enacted in the form of Section 52 and 53 of CDPA of 1988. The said sections are reproduced below:-",

                        "content": "Things done in reliance on registration of design.  (1) The copyright in an artistic work is not infringed by anything done—  (a) in pursuance of an assignment or licence made or granted by a person registered under the Registered Designs Act 1949 as the proprietor of a corresponding design, and  (b) in good faith in reliance on the registration and without notice of any proceedings for the cancellation [or invalidation] of the registration or for rectifying the relevant entry in the register of designs;  and this is so notwithstanding that the person registered as the proprietor was not the proprietor of the design for the purposes of the 1949 Act.  (2) In subsection (1) a “corresponding design”, in relation to an artistic work, means a design within the meaning of the 1949 Act which if applied to an article would produce something which would be treated for the purposes of this Part as a copy of the artistic work.    The overall object of these transitional provisions were that the two policies; one existing prior to 1988 and the one subsequent thereto  should apply to the designs which were existing earlier in the law and the new designs should continue to enjoy the limited kind of dual protection in the form of unregistered design right. The unregistered Designs which are derived from artistic copyright were given 25 years monopoly from the date of first marketing as an extended protection in common law. The said change was brought by the amendments with the aim that this will preserve the fine distinction between Design right and copyright. It is however highly doubtful whether the said actions and amendments brought by UK parliament really preserve such distinction or obliterates the same and establish a nexus between the Design right and common law right. Suffice it to say, that the said changes were made in UK law by giving such reasoning. The said object which was sought to be achieved by transitional provisions in CDPA 1988 has been explained very succinctly by the learned Author in his Book titled Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis. The relevant paragraph is reproduced below:- “43.52. As we have seen, an attempt was made under s 10 of the 1956 Act to restrict copyright protection for registrable designs to the same term of the design monopoly which would have existed had a registration been sought and obtained. Under the CDPA 1988, the same overall objective is sought to be achieved by s 52, although the form of the section is very different to its predecessor. The transitional provisions try to fuse these two regimes together. The copyright limiting provisions of s 52 of the 1988 Act apply to pre-August 1989 artistic works but the extent to which that section curtails copyright protection is determined by s 10 of the 1956 Act as follows: where s 10 applied to an artistic work at any time before 1 August 1989, s 52(2) now applies but the period of 25 years provided for by the latter is  replaced by a period of 15 years as defined under s 10 (3) of the 1956 Act. The general principle is that industrial exploitation plus sales prior to 1 August 1989 diminishes the period of protection and it is immaterial where the articles were manufactured. The effect of this transitional provision is nearly spent. To bring it into play and to start the clock running, the industrial exploitation and sales must have commenced before 1 August 1989; if they commenced later, s 52 applies without modification, 15 years from 31 July 1989 takes one to 30 July 2004 and any unauthorized sales by a third party must have taken place before that date to be infringing sales. The limitation period prevents such sales being actionable from 30 July 2010.”    In view of the above, it is clear that the legislative policies as framed in UK underwent a sea change with the passage of time and the said policies attempted to respect the fundamental difference between the copyright law and design law but at the same time also accommodated the interest of the proprietor by creating new kinds of rights which extended the monopoly rights which were earlier not existed in their law prior to 1988.  Thereafter, the judicial opinion on the subject also responded in consonance with the policy changes made in the national legislation of UK and therefore the judgments which were rendered for the period namely 1988 till 2000 onwards reflected legal position as it was existed in UK as per the change made in the law and public policy governing the field.    Law after the year 2001-The year 2001 has its own significance as a year which has changed the shape of design law as existed in UK and European Countries. There was a major policy change wherein it was not considered undesirable that one activity should be covered by two or more overlapping IP rights. In the year 2001, the European  Community had introduced a Directive No. 98/71/EC which virtually merged the design right into copyright right and extended the limited monopoly right of design right for 15 years to a full term of copyright of 60 years. The said European Directive mandated all the European countries including UK to change their domestic laws in consonance with the European community directives. The said policy change has been explained by the Author in his Book titled as Laddie, Prescott & Vitoria on The Modern Law of Copyright and Designs, Fourth Edition, Vol-II, Lexis Nexis wherein he has proceeded to state that the applicability of the said directive is an acceptance of the principle of dual protection in UK and in European region. The said observation of the author reads as under:-",

                        "content": "In Chapters 51-60 we discuss how our domestic law of registered designs has been significantly altered by the implementation of Directive 98/71/EC. The purpose of the Directive is to harmonize to a large extent the substantive, but not the procedural, laws of registered designs throughout the Community. However, it also contains within it a provision which has an impact on the issues we have been discussing in this chapter. One of the principles underlying the Directive (and the Community Designs Regulation which introduced Community registered and unregistered designs) is that of „cumulation‟. That is to say the piling of one intellectual property right on top of another. It is not considered undesirable that one activity should be covered by two or more overlapping intellectual property rights. More than that, the Directive prohibits, at least in some respects, attempts under national law to prevent such overlap. This is achieved by art 17 which provides:- “Relationship to Copyright  A Design protected by a Design right registered in or in respect of Member State in accordance with this Directive shall also be eligible  for protection under the law of the copyright of that state as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required shall be determined by each Member State”  Notwithstanding its broad wording, this is not attempting to create an entirely new type of copyright. What it is directed to is preventing national laws from prohibiting overlap between copyright and registered design rights. If, therefore, our domestic law had a provision which said „any design which is protected by a registered design cannot qualify for copyright protection as well‟, the Directive would override it. The design would be entitled to both forms of protection as if the domestic provision did not exist. We do not have any such provision. However, before we discuss the impact of art 17 on our UK domestic law, we need to consider it further.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

UK accepted the said policy changes in the form of Registered Design Regulations 2001 which came into force on 9th December, 2001.

In a landmark case titles as “The Trade Mark Cases” cited as 100 US 82(1879) decided in 1879, the Supreme Court of United States had evolved an important distinction between the Copyright, Patent rights and Trademark rights and the Supreme Court proceeded to observe that there lies a distinction between all these rights and the trademark has no necessary relation with the invention and discovery. In the words of Supreme Court it was observed thus:- “The ordinary trade-mark has no necessary action to invention or discovery. The trademark recognized by the common law is generally the growth of a considerable period of use, rather than a sudden invention. It is often the result of accident rather than design, and when under the act of Congress it is sought to establish it by registration, neither originality, invention, discovery, science, nor art is in any way essential to the right conferred by the act. If we should  endeavor to classify it under the head of writings of authors, the objections are equally strong. In this, as in regard to inventions, originality is required. And while the word writings may be liberally construed, as it has been, to include original designs for engravings, prints & c., it is only such as are original, and are founded in the creative powers of the mind. The writings which are to be protected are the fruits of intellectual labor, embodied in the form of books, prints, engravings and the like. The trademark may be, in generally is, the adoption of something already in existence as the distinctive symbol of the party using it. At common law the exclusive right to it grows out of its use, and not its mere adoption. By the act of Congress this exclusive right attaches upon registration. But in neither case does it depend upon novelty, invention, discovery, or any work of the brain. It requires no fancy or imagination, no genius, no laborious thought. It is simply founded on priority of appropriation. We look in vain in the statute for any other qualification or condition. If the symbol, however plain, simple, old, or well known has been first appropriated by the claimant as his distinctive trademark, he may be registration secure the right to its exclusive use. While such legislation may be a judicious aid to the common law on the subjects of trademarks, and may be within the competency of legislatures whose general powers embrace that class of subjects, we are unable to see any such power in the constitutional provision concerning authors and inventors, and their writings and discoveries.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

Therefore, the intention is clearly to permit such overlapping. In the words of US court it was observed thus:  “Under the power granted to the Congress in Art. I, § 8, cl. 8 of the Constitution, the Congress has enacted the copyright statute as Title 17, United states Code, and the patent statute as Title 35, United States Code.  In the two statutes, the Congress has created an area of overlap with regard to at least one type of su bject matter. Thus, the Congress has provided that subject matter of the type involved in the instant appeal is „statutory subject matter‟ under the copyright Statute and *1394 „statutory subject matter‟ under the design patent statute.

The Congress has provided that subject matter of the type involved in this appeal is „statutory subject matter‟ under the copyright statute and is „statutory subject matter‟ under the design patent statute, but the Congress has not  provided that an author-inventor must elect between securing a copyright or securing a design patent.

So far as the public  interests are concerned, there are two public interests which are competing and militating against each other in the case of present nature involving dual protection, One is the public interest of right to freely use the shape of the article upon the expiration of patent/design as per the object of the Designs Act and the competing interest is the interest of consumer to be protected as per the object of the Trade Marks Act. Some balance approach is required to be followed so that there should not exist any conflict with the two competing public interests and policy and one does not outweighs the other. Once the proprietor has already enjoyed the statutory monopoly with the disclosure of the same to the authority and to the general public and with a covenant with law that after expiration of the design, the right will be available to the public to freely use the said design, it would be incongruous to assume any further public interest to protect against confusion outweighing the paramount public interest which is right to exploit the work of lapsed patent so that further intentions and workings can be done upon the same. Such an approach of US court in the case of Honeywell (supra) is totally inconsistent being purely doctrinal one and overlooks the fundamentals of monopoly akin to patent law and limits its examination of the case purely on academic basis without considering its practical implications.",

The learned Author has discussed that by the passage of time the distinction between the trademark rights vis-à-vis other intellectual property have become totally withered away. In the words of learned Author, it has been stated:- “The passage of time, and with it the accretion of subsequent cases, new legislation, and regulations as well as commentary sacred and profane, not to mention accords tacit and explicit alike, have brought a measure of resolution to these issues at certain levels of doctrinal understanding. Certainly, no one doubts today that copyrightable subject matter may have additional protection under the Lanham Act when the separate requirements of that Act are met; the same apparently is true of patentable subject matter. 'Trademarks meanwhile, may be protected by copyright when they meet the requirements of authorship and originality Whether the subject matter of trademarks also may be patentable is less clear. But the Federal Circuit is currently considering a case in which the proprietors of trade dress are claiming the rights of a patentee. Assuming novelty, non-obviousness, and utility, nothing seems clearly to stand in the way of such a result.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

It has also been observed by the Author that by doing so, we are also equally unwise as we are tending to forget the reasons behind the laws for which they were enacted. The learned author also finds that we are unwise because we are forgetting the limits and bounds of the trade mark protection and proceedings to impede with the public domain by extending the doctrine unbridled by the law which is cause of central concern. In the words of the learned Author, it has been observed thus:- “We have learned, in short, to accommodate complexities in the field of intellectual property that would have confounded the Court that decided The Trademark Cases a little more than a century ago. And we have done so, as I say, largely unguided and unconstrained by the constitution. This is indeed why the Intellectual Property Clause matters now as it has not in the past.  In the view of many observers, myself among them, we have learned to be a bit too accommodating.\" The complexities in the interplay among our contemporary doctrines now allow a degree of slippage that is unwise twice over.  (Emphasis Supplied)  “We are unwise, first, in the confusion we have sown among doctrines once admirably self-contained. For what is implicit in The Trademark Cases is that there is a fundamental difference between copyright and patent rights, on the one hand, and trademarks on the other. Indeed, at the time, there was.” (Emphasis Supplied)  “The result is one I think Schecter himself would have denounced: We no longer know where the rational limits of trademarks lie. My colleague Paul Carrington likens the law to Mark Twain's River, rolling on forever and charting new meanders as it flows. It is a pretty metaphor. In the field of trademarks and unfair competition, though, it often seems  that the river is over its banks; the boundaries among doctrines are no longer clear.' And we are unwise, I would insist again, in allowing that to happen-unwise for perfectly straightforward doctrinal reasons wholly internal to the field. Lawyers cannot help clients whom they cannot counsel, and lawyers cannot counsel clients effectively about law they cannot sensibly predict or explain or defend. (Emphasis Supplied)  We are unwise, moreover, in the separate and additional degree to which we have allowed intellectual property doctrines to encroach upon the public domain. This is not a new problem in trademark law. The protean nature of trademark doctrines has been apparent for the better part of two decades. But one now senses a kind of critical mass as a new millennium approaches and new technologies converge with subject matters once the province of separate doctrines.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

Marketing Displays, Inc.: The problem with Trade Dress Protection For Expired Utility patents written by Keeley Canning Luhnow which was published in the Buffalo Intellectual Property law Journal, 2002 edition Vol. 1 at page 224. The learned author has dealt with the purpose behind the Designs and Patents Act and proceeded to observe that the extension of the monopoly is against the policy of the Designs and Patents Act. In the words of the author, it was observed thus:  “The term of a utility patent is twenty years from the date of the filing of the application. Once the patent has been granted, the application is made public so that others may determine what is covered by the patent.\" During the twenty years of the patent's validity, the patentee does not necessarily have the right to make, use, or sell the invention. The inventor does have the right to exclude others from making, using or selling the patented invention.  The purpose of the Patent Act, as stated by the Court in Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,a3 is to create a \"carefully crafted bargain for encouraging the creation and disclosure of new, useful, and non obvious advances in technology and design in return for the exclusive right to practice the invention for a period of years.\"'. The Supreme Court has identified three specific policies advanced by the Patent Act: First, patent law seeks to foster reward and invention; second, it promotes disclosure of inventions to stimulate further innovation and to permit the public to practice the invention once the patent expires; third, the stringent requirements for patent protection seek to assure  that ideas in the public domain remain there for the free use of the public.” (Emphasis Supplied)  The right to copy is believed by many commentators and courts to be implicit in the patent laws. The goals of the Act and the constitutional limits placed upon Congress by the Intellectual Property Clause \"led the Supreme Court to articulate a right to copy flowing from the Patent Act and the Constitution.\" Given that at the expiration of a patent the invention enters the public domain, many believe that by granting trade dress protection to anything included in a patent, the patent monopoly would be extended. This would defeat the main purpose of the Patent Act.” (Emphasis Supplied).",

As the scholars and researches across the globe themselves acknowledge, in the field of patents, we have seen the similar attempt by the innovators attempting to indefinitely enjoy the patent monopoly by making similar kind of substances which are subject matter of  patent especially in the field of pharmaceuticals leading to dual monopoly type situation.

The said policy governs the field and cannot be departed with. The countries like US and UK have adopted a significantly new policy towards never ending protection of the rights in relation to shape of the commercial articles which in their economic state of affairs may be permissible. But India being a Welfare State has to serve several important goals as provided in the Preamble of Constitution of India. The fundamental rights to do any business under Article 19 (1) (g) is one such fundamental right. The same is however subject to reasonable restrictions as contained in Article 19 (6) which can be imposed by the Act of Parliament. Once the restrictions contained in the law cease to have effect and legislative policy also states the same, it would be impermissible to judicially extend the said restriction by putting the same in another bracket of common law (more so when there exists no such common law right) which would violate the fundamental rights of the citizens to use such inventions or designs which were earlier subjected to monopoly rights conferred by the Sovereign. Therefore, in the interest of proprietors and right  holders, the courts of justice cannot permit the proprietors to enjoy monopoly rights in perpetuity when the position in law says that the said rights extinguish once the patents and designs expire and the articles go in public domain. The said right of the public which exists in law and policy cannot be abridged by the judgment of this court. As such, the said view of extending the monopoly right even after expiration of the patent shall also be against the public policy. Therefore, there exists a policy difference between the view prevalent in USA and UK as against in India and till the time this policy change is brought into force very clearly by the Parliament, such extension of rights is seemingly impermissible.",

The answer to the said proposition is that what goes in public domain is the shape of the articles by virtue of the expiration of design and not the trade dress of the label or what has been represented on the outer packaging indicating the source of the product or what is outside the scope of the monopoly claimed in the Design right. The remedy of the passing off would lie in case the competitor not merely copies the shape of the article existing in public domain but also copies the trade dress, get up or any other feature in which case proprietor can take action to the extent there is confusion as to source as indicated on the packaging of the article. The reason is very simple, the design or shape of the article is distinct from trade dress action. The trade dress action, on the contrary cannot be extended to include the shape of the goods which are in public domain after expiration of the design.",

John Distilleries Ltd., 2011 (47) PTC 100 wherein the learned single judge of Bombay High Court while considering the case of passing off premised on shape marks has also considered the Design registration of defendant under the Designs Act, 2000 and proceeded to observe that the same is inconsequential for maintaining the passing off action. I find that the said judgment is clearly distinguishable from the proposition with which this court is concerned with. This is due to the reason that in the instant case, we are concerned with the proprietor’s attempt to enjoy both the inconsistent rights for the purposes of extension of monopoly right. In Gorbatschow (supra), the stand of the plaintiff was that the bottles manufactured by the company are forming part of distinctive shape mark as such entitled to protection, the said plaintiff no where claimed the monopoly of Design right before the court. It is rather the Defendant who had set up the registration of Design as a Defence in the said suit. In response to which, the learned single judge observed that it is not necessary for the plaintiff to go for Design registration and the shape are as such protectable. There is no quibbling to the said proposition and as such the said case does not come in the way of mine to take the view which I am taking. This is due to the reason that I have reconciled the conflict between the two inconsistent rights by adopting the principle of election of rights. Once the proprietor elects to treat the shape of the product as a trade mark and proceeds to approach the court on the very same premise, the mere fact that the defendant has registered a design of the said product is inconsequential so far as the claim of the trade mark rights of the proprietor is concerned if his election is found to be consistent throughout. On the  contrary, if the proprietor elects to proceed with the limited monopoly right of Design, then it seems impermissible for him to place reliance on common law right in the event his action fails on the statutory rights as there exists no such common law rights in addition to the limited monopoly rights granted by the statute of Designs.",

On the contrary, the passing off is a common law right existing for different reasons which undermines the public policy operating behind the statutory rights like patents and designs. Thus, clearly, the Design Act, 2000 required no saving of any common law right due to the very nature of the Design right being statutory cannot accommodate common law right along side the same as doing it would be against the principle which forms the basis of patent and design right which is conferment of limited monopoly rights. That is the reason why the patents and the design acts do not contemplate any such common law right or saves the same as they are not aimed at granting the monopoly rights in perpetuity but only aimed at granting the limited rights.",

In the present case, I have already discussed above that the saving of the common law right in the case of the Design Right was not necessitated as the same is inconsistent with the nature and characteristic of the Design right which disturbs the policy to confer the limited rights on the proprietor. Thus, the said common law right could not have been saved by the Legislature in view of the clear legislative intent to grant limited rights. The said absence of saving clause in the Design  Act unlike 27 (2) of the Trade Marks Act is thus not inconsequential but is a conscious omission on the part of the legislature as the legislature never intended to confer the rights in perpetuity to the Design right holder. Thus, the said absence of saving is consistent with the nature and legislative policy operating behind the design right. Therefore, to say that the said distinction between common law and statutory right as emanating from the view propounded by Justice G.R. Luthra in the Tobu Vs. Megha (supra) is meaningless is not correct understanding of law and policy behind the Design Act. The said view is the only correct exposition of the law on the subject.

This is due to the reason that the very existence of the unregistered right in common law would make the statutory grant of design right meaningless or redundant. Secondly, once the nature and characteristic of the monopoly is such that it is a true monopoly based on statutory right akin to patent, it is inconceivable as to how there can be any monopoly be available under the common law which can exists besides the registered design right itself as the same would again mean that without disclosing the date of novelty, claim and scope of the monopoly in the design application, any person can claim anything in relation to the shape of the article in common law as a design right without  any need to register the same and disclosing the authority about the newness in the shape. I find that such exposition of the law wherein the Designs are protected in common law in addition to the statutory right would defeat the existence of the Statutory right itself. Additionally, the said common law right of passing off if allowed to be given to the proprietor of the Registered Design while enforcing his Design right would also come in the way of expiration of the monopoly of Design right as the said right would never expire and continue to exist in common law.

Thus, to say that preventing the passing off right in shape of the article would lead to anomalous situation leaving the confusion to happen in the market is not correct understanding of law. In the subsisting Design right, the shape of the article would enjoy the monopoly conferred for limited period of time by the Design Act and the confusion in the market can still be prevented by filing a passing off action on the basis of the trade dress right if the infringer or any person besides using the shape also uses get up or name or mark or any other sign which may lead the consumer or unwary purchaser to believe the product is emanated from the proprietor. This is the only reconciliation where under one can preserve both the legislative intendments of Design right as well as the public interest involving the confusion.

                        "content": "In one of the article titled as Extending the Monopoly? The Risks and Benefits of multiple forms of Intellectual property protection authored by Gordon J. Zimmerman published in Canadian Intellectual Property Review volume 17 at page 345 published in Canada, the learned author in the said article has extensively discussed about the overlapping of the rights in trade marks rights in trade dress with that of Design right. After noticing the various precedents from US courts which has been seen in the present case, the learned author in conclusion of his paper suggested that the election of rights as one of the safest mode to reconcile the conflicting overlap of the monopoly rights. In the words of the learned author, it has been observed thus:  “Perhaps it is fair to put the creator of an industrial design to a choice: either accept a 10-year exclusive term of protection without proof of reputation, or risk losing any claim to distinctiveness by forgoing such protection. If the creator forgoes any monopoly design protection and nonetheless succeeds in establishing distinctiveness for the design, then the creator will be entitled to receive a potentially unlimited term of protection as a distinguishing guise or trade-mark. Perhaps that should be the reward for taking the risk that exclusivity will not be achieved. In contrast, the bargain for achieving a 10-year up-front monopoly by way of industrial design registration may be that no protection of the design thereafter, by trade-mark or otherwise, will be possible. (Emphasis Supplied)  “Thus, it may be fair to deny the holder of an industrial design the option of effectively extending protection in the design itself, as a trademark, beyond the industrial design term of protection. However, if the creator of the design is willing to accept the risk that the mark may not become or remain distinctive, and forgo industrial design protection, it may be entitled to claim the benefit of trade-mark protection when it  can show distinctiveness through extensive use. In contrast, the extension of protection for a design as a distinguishing guise or otherwise following expiry of an industrial design registration may be found to be likely unreasonably to limit the development of the art or industry in which the design has been used, and thus be prohibited.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

The observations being relevant are culled out hereinafter:- “In the light of the above discussion, we now examine the doctrine of election. There are three elements of election, namely, existence of two or more remedies; inconsistencies between such remedies and a choice of one of them. If any one of the three elements is not there, the doctrine will not apply. According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol. 25, p. 652, if in truth there is only one remedy, then the doctrine of election does not apply. In the present case, as stated above, the NPA Act is an additional remedy to the DRT Act. Together they constitute one remedy and, therefore, the doctrine of election does not apply. Even according to Snell's Principles of Equity (31st Edn., p. 119), the doctrine of election of remedies is applicable only when there are two or more coexistent remedies available to the litigants at the time of election which are repugnant and inconsistent. In any event, there is no repugnancy nor inconsistency between the two remedies, therefore, the doctrine of election has no application.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

It needs no reiteration that once the Design patent expires, the shape or embodiment of the article goes in public domain. The authorities across the globe acknowledge the said proposition. In such circumstances, it is too pressing for me to take a contrary view which is legally unsustainable which is that the public domain right which is implicit in the statutory cannot be encroached upon by judicial extension of the monopoly rights.",

Once, the proprietor has chosen the root of the patent or monopoly akin to patent, the exclusive rights  vest in him for a limited period of time, at that point of time he enjoys exclusively to the exclusion of the others. However, after the expiry, the proprietor has a covenant with the law that the said shape, embodiment or function which are subject matter of the patent or design shall go in public domain. It is as a matter of law or operation of law, such shape or features as a mandate of policy going into public domain. In such circumstances, it can be said that now once the rights under the statute are exhausted, there subsist another right under the distinguishing guise which may encroach of the right of the public domain for all times to come and will inhibit the law to take its own course.",

The said remedy of passing off is available in alternative to the statutory protection conferred by the Design Right. For the purposes of the same, the suitor has to elect between the two inconsistent rights and remedies having distinct objects and policies.  a)  Notwithstanding the above said conclusion in (b) and (c), the remedy of passing off would continue to be available along with the infringement of registered designs and can be joined with the same in order to prevent consumer confusion which may be caused by the use of trade mark, get up, trade dress or in any other manner excepting the shape of the goods which is or was forming the subject matter of the registration of the Design.  b)  The remedy of the passing off in so far as the shape of the article is concerned shall also be available even during currency of the design monopoly or even after the expiry of same to the extent that the claim of the feature of the shape is not covered within the novelty claim under the Design monopoly rights and the said claim of the protection qualifies all the necessary ingredients of the Trade Mark.  c)  A remedy of passing off in so far as the shape of the article is concerned shall not be available even after the expiry of the Design to the extent the said feature of the shape of the article is covered within the novelty claim as made under the Design Right as after expiration of the Design, the novel shape claimed under the Design Act goes in public domain.",

In this behalf reliance was placed on the judgment of the Chancery Division, England and Wales in the case of Numatic International Ltd. Vs Qualtex UK Ltd. [2010] EWHC 1237 (Ch.). It was submitted that a remedy of passing off action was available to protect the rights which inhere in a shape, pattern or an ornamentation which has gained secondary meaning amongst consumers. The design, it was submitted, protects non-functional attributes which relate to aesthetics and are pleasing to the eye. Mr Goel, thus contended that, therefore, a remedy by way of a passing off action was available both during the subsistence of the statutory right created in a design and thereafter. The remedy of a passing off as against design infringement were independent of each other, therefore, did not impinge upon each other. Since the two remedies were not mutually inconsistent and thus not destructive of each other, both actions, could be combined in one suit.",

To support this argument, a reference was made to Section 15(2) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 (Copyright Act)7 to contend that copyright and design which is capable of registration under the Designs Act and has not been registered and if the design was applied to industrial process, more than 50 times, the copyright in such a design was lost.

Design as is generally understood refers to the features of shape, configuration, pattern or ornament when applied to an article. It is for this reason that designs such as these are described as Industrial Designs. It is these designs which are covered under the Designs Act. Designs can be two dimensional or three dimensional. While pattern or an ornament would ordinarily be applied to an article; shape and configuration, become the article itself. Designs in that sense relate to the non-functional features of the article. Therefore, by necessary corollary, a design which has functional attributes cannot be registered under the Designs Act. This is the essence of Section 2(d) of the Designs Act. The protection under the Designs Act is granted only to those designs which have an aesthetic value or otherwise appeal to the eye. There may be, however, cases where the design while fulfilling the test of being appealing to the eye, is also, functional. [See judgment in the case of Cow (P.B.) & Coy Ld. Vs Cannon Rubber Manufacturers Ld. (1959) RPC 347]. In this case the diagonal ribs on a hot water bottle were both appealing to the eye as well as functional. They were functional in as much as they permitted the heat to be radiated without singeing the user. The conundrum of functionality was resolved by taking note of the fact that it would make no impact on the articles functionality if, the ribs on the hot water bottle were either horizontal or vertical or even diagonal formations.",

Therefore, in a passing off action the plaintiff would have to establish the following ingredients :- (i) . that there is goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which the plaintiff offers, in the mind of the purchasing public, i.e., the consumers, who associate or are in a position to identify such goods or services by virtue of trademark used, which could include the get-up, trade-dress, signs, packaging, label, etc.  (ii) . that the defendant has employed mis-representation which has made the consumers believe that the defendants goods are those of the plaintiff. It is no defence in an action of passing off that the mis-representation was unintentional or lacked fraudulent intent;  (iii) . And lastly, that the defendant's action has caused damage or is calculated to cause damage;  [see Reckitt & Colman Products Limited Vs. Borden Inc. & Ors.

Therefore, the argument that the legislature by not incorporating a similar provision, such as Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, has by necessary implication excluded the availability of such like remedy to a plaintiff, who uses a registered design, as his trade mark, is untenable. Our view is fortified by the opinion expressed in that regard by the learned authors of book –McCarthy:  “....Dual protection from both design patent and trademark law may exist where it is alleged that the configuration or shape of a container or article serves to identify and distinguish the source of goods – that is, acts as a trademark or trade dress. Such a container or product shape may also be  capable of design patent protection. In such cases, the protection afforded by patent law vis-a-vis trademark law is quite different.  In the Mogen David Wine Bottle case 372 F.2d 539 the existence of design patent protection for a container (Mogen David Wine bottle) was held not to preclude the right to enter on the Principal Register the bottle shape as a trademark for the wine. Judge Smith compared design patent protection to trademark protection for container shapes:  The purpose of the federal design patent laws is to encourage the creation of ornamental design. The inventor receives, for a limited period, a federal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling the patented design throughout the United States. Upon expiration of the design patent this federal right no longer exists. Thus the inventor loses this exclusive right or interest. Federal trademark laws, independent in origin from design patent law, have the dual purpose of protecting both the trademark owner and the public from confusion, mistake and deception.  Judge Smith concluded that:  Thus all appellant asserts is the right to register the shape of the container as a trademark for its wines for the reason that its serves to identify and distinguish them from those of others. In no sense is there any assertion of an interest in the container shape per se for all uses... If the public recognizes and accepts appellant‟s container shape in a trademark sense, appellant seeks only federal recognition of that public interest. It is the public that is protected... I conclude from these considerations that the federal patent laws and trademark laws are not in conflict. Appellant is thus not barred from seeking federal protection for what the public recognizes as a trademark.  The court concluded that Mogen David wine Co. had not sustained its evidentiary burden of proving that the bottle shape had acquired secondary meaning so as to function as a trademark identifying Mogen David wines and distinguishing  them from wines of competitors. The bottle was held not to create a commercial impression separate and apart from teh word marks appearing on the label on the bottle.  However, these statements of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals must be compared with the dictum of the United States Supreme Court in Kellogg Co. V. National Biscuit Co. where Justice Brandeis appeared to say that the pillow-shaped shredded wheat biscuit fell into the public domain upon expiration of a design patent covering the biscuit shape and of functional patents covering production machinery. After holding that “shredded wheat” was a generic term, not a trademark, Justice Brandeis said of plaintiff‟s claim to exclusive right in the shape of the biscuit :  The plaintiff has not the exclusive right to sell shredded wheat in the form of a pillow-shaped biscuit – the form in which the article became known to the public. That is the form in which shredded what was made under the basic patent. The patented machines used were designed to produce only the pillow-shaped biscuits. And a design patent was taken out to cover the pillow-shaped form. Hence, upon expiration of the patents, the form, as well as the name, was dedicated to the public. Kellogg Company was free to use the pillow-shaped form, subject only to the obligation to identify its product lest it be mistaken for that of the plaintiff.  It could be argued that the Shredded Wheat case says that the existence of design patent protection for a shape precludes trademark significance for the same shape. Exactly the opposite was held in Mogen David. However, Mogen David and the Shredded Wheat cases can be reconciled on a number of points. The shredded wheat biscuit design patent was held invalid before it expired, and the Supreme Court said that the biscuit shape was functional, and hence not capable of either trademark or design patent protection :  The evidence is persuasive that this form is functional – that the cost of the biscuit would be increased and its high quality lessened if some other form were substituted for the pillow shape.  As a primarily functional shape, the biscuit could possess no trademark significance or distinctiveness at all. The C.C.P.A. has in fact distinguished the Shredded Wheat dicta on the grounds discussed above.  In 1993, the Seventh Circuit, agreeing with the analysis in Mogen David and similar cases, noted that “the C.C.P.A., the Federal Circuit and the T.T.A.B. have since interpreted 45 to allows trademark protection for qualifying product configurations. A constitutional challenge to such registrations was rejected by the court. The argument that was rejected was that the Constitutional Patent Clause requires that protection be for a “limited time,” trademark protection for a product shape is the equivalent of a perpetual design patent, and therefore such trademark protection is unconstitutional. The court held that trademark protection is not the equivalent of a perpetual patent because the nature and scope of trademark protection is significantly different from that of a design patent :  Federal trademark protection does not transform the durationally limited monopoly of a design patent into a perpetual right... [The registrant] simply has the right to preclude other from copying its trademarked product for the purpose of confusing the public as to its source. [A competitor] is free to copy [the registrant‟s] design so long as it insures that the public is not thereby deceived or confused into believing that its copy is a [registrant‟s] faucet.  In fact, a design patent, rather than detracting from a claim of trademark, may support such a claim. Since a design patent is granted only for non-functional designs, it may be presumptive evidence of non-functionality and thus support the trademark claimant. However, while a design patent is some evidence of non-functionality, it is not sufficient without some other evidence.  The fact that an infringer of trade dress owns a design patent on this product design is no defense to the trade dress charge. A patent is a grant of a right to exclude, not of a right to use. “Thus, if a patented product operates to deceive or confuse consumers as to its source or sponsorship, there is no  reason why the patent holder cannot be enjoined from such deception or confusion.  The potential conflict between patent and trade dress law is heightened when federal anti-dilution law is invoked to create exclusive rights in a product design. While the likelihood of confusion test operates to distinguish the scope of patent from trade dress infringement, anti-dilution infringement has no such requirement of likely confusion and more closely resembles design patent law..”  (emphasis supplied)",

A case in point is the judgment of the House of Lords in Smith Kline & French Laboratories Ltd. vs Sterling-Winthrop Group Ltd. (1975) 1 W.L.R. 914. Briefly, the appellant before the House of Lords was claiming registration of a colour mark. The appellant was a manufacturer of a pharmaceutical pellets -one half of which bore different colours (the colour was unique to each pellet), while other half was transparent. The House of Lords while allowing the appeal made the following crucial observations:  “....In stating what he conceived to be the difference between a registrable design and a registrable trade mark, Sargant L.J. said, at p. 668:  “A design form part of the goods themselves. A trade mark is something which is extra, which is added to the goods for the purpose of denoting the origin of the goods, and, speaking generally of trade mark and design, the same thing is not a trade mark and a design.”  It is conceded that if this is to be understood as meaning that what is capable of being registered as a design is ipso facto incapable of being registered as a trade mark, it does not correctly state the law. If this latter part of the dictum is omitted, the preceding words would not rule out the trade marks claimed by SKF in the instant case. The “extra” added to the goods is the colour applied to one half of the capsule and the various colours applied to the individual pellets within the capsules.  In the instant case the ground upon which all three members of the Court of Appeal overruled Graham J. And rejected SKF‟s applications was that the description of the mark was merely a description of the whole external appearance of the goods in respect of which it was intended to be registered, viz. the capsules and their pellets. This is another way of saying that if the mark when applied to the goods will cover the  whole visible surface of the goods it cannot be registered as a trade mark. For my part, as I have said, I cannot see any business reason why this should be so, and I can find nothing in the Act or in the authorities to justify such a conclusion. Upon this, which is the main point in the appeal, I would uphold the judgment of Graham J......”",

The learned Single Judge went on to observe that: \"The net result, therefore, is that when the design of both the parties is registered, no action in the nature of issue of injunction or recovery of damages is permissible\". The view taken was: the remedy available to an aggrieved party in such a case would be to move for cancellation of registration under Section 51 of the old Act (now Section 52). The learned Judge, while recognizing the fact that Section 47 of the old Act (now Section 11) created a substantive right in favour of the person whose design was registered, the said provision, according to the learned Judge, did not state that a registration which is obtained earlier in point of time will prevail over the later registration.

Both reasons, according to us, overlook the fundamental principle that in order to institute a suit, a right has not to be necessarily found in a statute enacted by a legislature.

The single Judge based his judgment on the Division Bench judgment of the Allahabad High Court and the Lahore High Court in the case of Mohd. Abdul Karim vs Yasin & Anr. AIR 1934 All. 798 (DB) and Qadar Bakhsh vs Ghulam Mohd. AIR 1934 Lahore 709, respectively. The learned Single Judge while taking into account the fact that the plaintiff's design was  same or identical, in that case the defendant, whose design was registered much later, cannot be said to be 'proprietor' of a new or original design, not previously published in India\". The learned Single Judge based on the judgments of the Allahabad High Court and Lahore High Court, came to the following conclusion: a person claiming to be proprietor of a registered design, which is not new or original, and which is being used by others, since prior to his registration, or such design, notwithstanding such registration, is not entitled to seek legal remedies provided under Section 53 of the Act (i.e., the old Act). The learned Single Judge was thus, of the view that, the defendant would not be entitled to seek legal remedies under Section 53 of the old Designs Act, in case, he were to file a suit, against the plaintiff, and therefore, could the defendant use such a registered design, as a shield in a suit filed by the plaintiff. The learned Single Judge was, therefore, of the view that the defendant who is found to be a pirator of the design, cannot be allowed to defeat the just and legal right available to him under law, including the right to seek injunction under Section 53 of the old Act.

                        "content": "2  A single Judge of the Bombay High Court in the case of Gorbatschow Wodka KG vs John Distilleries Ltd. 2011 (47) PTC 100 (Bom.) granted an interim injunction in a passing off action against a defendant, which had a registered design in its favour. The plaintiff in that case filed a quia timet action against the defendant in which he asserted that the shape of its Wodka bottles was distinctive and formed an intrinsic part of its goodwill and reputation. The grievance of the plaintiff apparently was that the defendant had invaded its intellectual property rights by adopting a deceptive variation of the shape of the bottles of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that, it had registered the shape of its bottle in various jurisdictions across the world, and that, in India, it had applied for registration of the shape of its bottle, as a trademark under the Trademarks Act. The defendants, as noticed in the judgment, had obtained registration under the Designs Act and thus inter alia pleaded that an action for passing off would not lie. Dr. Justice D. Y. Chandrachud pertinently made following observations in the judgment:  “...15. The fact that the Defendant has obtained registration under the Designs Act, 2000, does not impinge the right of the Plaintiff to move an action for passing off. Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect the right of action against any person for passing off goods or services. Section 27(2) is a statutory recognition of the principle that the remedy of passing off lies and is founded in common law.",

                        "content": "Now, in the present case, the material which has been placed on the record by the Plaintiff, prima facie indicates that the Plaintiff has an established trans border reputation and that an integral part of that reputation lies in the shape of the bottle in which Vodka is sold. The shape of the bottle which the Plaintiff has adopted has no functional relationship with the nature of the product or the quality required of the container in which Vodka has to be sold. The shape, to use the language of a leading authority on the subject, is capricious. It is  capricious in the sense that it is novel and originated in the ingenuity and imagination of the Plaintiff….  ….The true test is not as to whether the Defendant took a search from the Design Register. As the first user of the shape, the Plaintiff was not bound to register it under the Designs Act, 2000. If the Defendant knew that the bottles of the Plaintiff with a distinctive shape were in the market -as a prudent person in the trade would know upon a diligent enquiry no amount of search in the Register would bring it within the purview of an honest adoption......  ..... 22. The test is whether the shape that has been adopted by the Plaintiff is one that is adopted capriciously, purely to give the article a distinctive appearance or characteristic of the goods of the manufacturer. If that be so, the manufacturer may be able to establish that he has a reputation and goodwill in the distinctive appearance of the article itself which would furnish a cause of action in passing off.....  ... Secondly, under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the shape of goods and their packaging is statutorily recognized as a constituent element of a trade mark as distinguishing the goods or services of a person with those of others; Thirdly, the submission of the Plaintiff that no other manufacturer either globally or in India has adopted the shape of the bottle of the Plaintiff (save and except for the Defendant) has not been disputed in the course of submissions by counsel for the Defendant; Fourthly the shape which has been adopted by the Plaintiff is unique to the point of being capricious......”",

                        "content": "On various issues raised we may crystallize our opinion as follows.  (i)  A plaintiff could institute a suit for infringement of a design against a defendant, who was also a holder of a registered design. The expression \"any person\" found in Section 22 of the Designs Act would not exclude a subsequent registrant as, according to us, no such words of limitation are found in said Section.  (ii)  The plaintiff would be entitled to institute an action of passing off in respect of a design used by him as a trade mark provided the action contains the necessary ingredients to maintain such a proceeding. The argument that such a suit could be instituted only after the expiry of the statutory period provided under Section 11 of the Designs Act, does not find favour with us. This is for the reason that in a given fact situation the plaintiff may have commenced the use of the design as a trademark after its registration. While Section 2(d) of the Designs Act excludes from the definition of a design, any trademark which is defined as such in clause (v) of sub-Section (1) of Section 2 of the 1958 Act or property mark, as defined in Section 479 of the IPC, or any artistic work as defined in clause (c) of Section 2 of the Copyright Act -the use of the design as a trademark post its registration, is not stipulated as a ground for cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.  (ii)  (a) In this context we must note the argument of Ms Singh, learned amicus, that passing off action may perhaps be maintainable provided the mark has attained secondary meaning. In our opinion, the issue before us is limited to whether a remedy by way of passing off action would be available qua a registered design used as a trademark by the plaintiff -we are not inclined to comment on the quality of evidence which may be required, if at all, to be produced by the plaintiff to prove whether the mark has acquired the necessary secondary distinctive meaning, for him to secure success, in the action instituted in that behalf.   (iii)  We are also of the view that a composite suit for infringement of a registered design and a passing off action would not lie. The Court could, however, try the suits together, if the two suits are filed in close proximity and/or it is of the view that there are aspects which are common to the two suits. The discretion of the court in this matter would necessarily be paramount.",

For the purposes of doing this analysis, it is deemed expedient to first have a look at Section 22 and Section 11 of the Designs Act, 2000 minutely. The said Sections read as under:- (1)  “Sec 22. Piracy of registered design. -During the existence of copyright in any design it shall not be lawful for any person- (a)  for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be applied to any article in any class of articles in which the design is registered, the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof, except with the licence or written consent of the registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to enable the design to be so applied; or  (b)  to import for the purposes of sale, without the consent of the registered proprietor, any article belonging to the class in which the design has been registered, and having applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof; or  (c)  knowing that the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof has been applied to any article in any class of articles in which the design is registered without the consent of the registered proprietor, to publish or expose or cause to be published or exposed for sale that article.  (2)  If any person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be liable for every contravention- (a)  to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a sum not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees recoverable as a contract debt, or  (b)  if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery of damages for any such contravention, and for an injunction against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages as may be awarded and to be restrained by injunction accordingly:  Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one design under clause (a) shall not exceed fifty thousand rupees:  Provided further that no suit or any other proceeding for relief under this sub-section shall be instituted in any  court below the court of District Judge.  (3)  - In any suit or any other proceeding for relief under subsection (2), every ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19 shall be available as a ground of defence.  (4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in the second proviso to sub-section (2), where any ground on which the registration of a design may be cancelled under section 19 has been availed of as a ground of defence and sub-section (3) in any suit or other proceeding for relief under sub-section (2), the suit or such other proceeding shall be transferred by the court, in which the suit or such other proceeding is pending, to the High Court for decision.  (5)  When the court makes a decree in a suit under sub-section (2), it shall send a copy of the decree to the Controller, who shall cause an entry thereof to be made in the register of designs.”  (1)  Section 11. Copyright on registration.-When a design is registered, the registered proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have copyright in the design during ten years from the date of registration.  (2)  If, before the expiration of the said ten years, application for the extension of the period of copyright is made to the Controller in the prescribed manner, the Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed fee, extend the period of copyright for a second period of five years from the expiration of the original period of ten years.",

This is further clear when section 22 (2) which talks about contravention uses the expression “any person” and “registered proprietor” separately while providing for the liability of the said “any person”. It cannot be said that a person who is registered proprietor can be said to be the one for whom it is not lawful to apply the said design to an article.  A corollary to this would certainly be that “any person” for whom it is not lawful to apply the design to an article during the existence of copyright, other than registered design holder. What follows from bare reading of Section 22(1) and 22(2) is that the person who can contravene Section 22(1) has to be a person other than the registered proprietor and therefore a registered proprietor cannot be subsumed within the ambit of Section 22(1) and 22(2) and hence cannot be liable for infringement.

Taylor and has held as under:  “The rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor(3) is well recognised and is founded on sound principle. Its result is (1) I.L.R. [1960] 2 All. 488. (2) L.R. 63 IA. 372. (3) [1875] 1 Ch. D. 426, 431. that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act and has laid down the method in which that power has to be exercised, it necessarily prohibits the doing of th act in any other manner than that which has been prescribed. The principle behind the rule is that if this were not so, the statutory provision might as well not have been enacted. A magistrate, therefore, cannot in the course of investigation record a confession except in the manner laid down in s. 164. The power to record the confession had obviously been given so that the confession might be proved by the record of it made in the manner laid down. If proof of the confession by other means was permissible, the whole provision of s. 164 including the safeguards contained in it for the protection of accused persons would be rendered nugatory. The section, therefore, by conferring on magistrates the power to record statements or confessions, by necessary implication, prohibited a magistrate from giving oral evidence of the statements or confessions made to him.

The learned single judge also established a connect between the Trade Mark Act shape mark concept vis a vis Design Act and proceed to observe the Design Registration is immaterial if a suitor opts for a remedy of passing off under the Trade mark Act. The learned single judge observes thus:  “13. The action before the Court is a quia timet action which seeks to injunct the Defendant from launching its product in India. The basis and foundation of the action is that the Defendant has adopted a bottle for the sales of its product which in its shape bears a striking resemblance to the bottle of the Plaintiff. Under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the shape of goods is now statutorily recognized as being a constituent element of a trade mark. Section 2(zb) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 defines the expression 'trade mark' to mean \"a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others\" and to include the \"shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours\". Parliament has, therefore, statutorily recognized that the shape in which goods are marketed, their packaging and combination of colours form part of what is described as the trade dress. A manufacturer who markets a product may assert the distinctive nature of the goods sold in terms of the unique shape through which the goods are offered for sale.  “The fact that the Defendant has obtained registration under the Designs Act, 2000, does not impinge the right of the Plaintiff to move an action for passing off. Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides that nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect the right of action against any person for passing off goods or services. Section 27(2) is a statutory recognition of the principle that the remedy of passing off lies and is founded in common law.” (Emphasis Supplied).",

It is well settled that when there are two inconsistent remedies prescribed under the law to a party and the party elects one of the remedies and proceed further on one premise, then the party is by virtue of law of election of the said remedy is estopped from going back and switching over to other inconsistent remedy.

The observations being relevant are culled out hereinafter:- “In the light of the above discussion, we now examine the doctrine of election. There are three elements of election, namely, existence of two or more remedies; inconsistencies between such remedies and a choice of one of them. If any one of the three elements is not there, the doctrine will not apply. According to American Jurisprudence, 2d, Vol. 25, p. 652, if in  truth there is only one remedy, then the doctrine of election does not apply. In the present case, as stated above, the NPA Act is an additional remedy to the DRT Act. Together they constitute one remedy and, therefore, the doctrine of election does not apply. Even according to Snell's Principles of Equity (31st Edn., p. 119), the doctrine of election of remedies is applicable only when there are two or more co-existent remedies available to the litigants at the time of election which are repugnant and inconsistent. In any event, there is no repugnancy nor inconsistency between the two remedies, therefore, the doctrine of election has no application.\" (Emphasis Supplied)",

                        "content": "In the present case also, the situation like the present one exists as there is a prima facie overlapping remedies / rights exist which are given by the law for protection of shapes either in the form of Design Act which is purely statutory in nature and another in the form of anti-thesis trademark protection by securing registration therein and which also saves the common law of passing off under Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The said remedy under the Designs Act is thus mutually inconsistent with that of trademark remedy as the rights under the Designs Act are purely statutory in nature. The said inconsistencies between remedies under the Trade Marks Act and  Design Act can be outlined as follows:  a.  Where as the remedy under the Trade Marks Act is statutory as well as equitable in nature as it saves common law remedy, the rights and remedies under the Design Act are purely statutory in nature based on the strict word of statute.  b.  The rights under the Trade Mark Act are based on securing registration as well as rights exists in common law by way of prior user which may lead to distinctiveness of the mark in question in market. Unlike, the Trade Marks Act, the rights in Design Act are conferred only if the design is novel on the date of application as well as original. The said aspect of novelty is akin to law of patents which states that the invention must not be disclosed to public or pre published piece of art. Thus, whereas in Trade Marks Act prior user confers rights in common law; in Design Act is completely inconsistent in nature where prior user from the date of application destroys the rights as the same may lead pre publication in the eyes of the law.  c.  Trade Marks are Registered for the period of 10 years and are renewable thereafter for the further period of 10 years each time they are due for renewal. Thus, there is no limitation on the period of trade marks to remain in force. The same also holds good for trade marks rights exist in common law. The only exception to the same is when the court declares that due to the long and extensive  usage of the said mark, the said mark has become generic. On the other hand, the Design is registered for 10 years and further renewed for one more term of 5 years and in that way, the said right under the Design is for the limited period of time.  d.  Passing off right is saved by one Trade Marks Act and not saved by Design Act.  e.  Validity of trade mark right cannot be seriously questioned by urging in defence in an infringement action under the Trade Marks Act (except on the limited grounds permitted by the Act and for the rest, there is a cancellation action under section 57 which is available under the Act). On the other hand, every ground of cancellation under the Design Act is permissible to be urged as a defence to an infringement action by virtue of section 22 (3) read with section 19 of Designs Act.  By reading aforementioned inconsistencies, it is more than apparent that the rights and remedies under the Design Act are inconsistent with that those existing under the Trade Marks Act. A right holder either of a trade mark or of design cannot permitted to ride on two boats when both are going different ways. A person having registered his design under the Design Act which is for the limited period of time for 15 years in total cannot be allowed to urge inconsistently to state that his rights should still be protected even if his design right fails due to pre publication or otherwise due to exhaustion on the premise that the common law right of passing off as existing under the Trade Marks Act or having a registered Trade Mark under  the TM Act still remains available despite the same. If the person is allowed to do like this, then a right holder may be permitted to enjoy rights on the shape of the goods indefinitely which cannot be intent of the law makers.  Thus, a person has to elect between two inconsistent remedies permissible under the law so that the necessary balance between the two may be struck and rights are to be adjudicated on that basis. Once elected, the right holder is estopped from switching over the right or remedy to the one which is inconsistent to the other.",

                        "content": "Let me now discuss the judicial opinion on the subject. It is noteworthy to mention that the judicial opinion when it comes to maintainability of the suit against a registered proprietor of the design as well as availability of remedy of passing off thereon, is inconsistent from the very beginning, long drawn debate has begun from the judgment given by this Court in the case of Tobu Enterprises Pvt Ltd  Vs Megha Enterprises and Anr, wherein learned Single Judge Justice G.R. Luthra of this Court, after analyzing the provisions relating to Designs Act and comparing with that of the Trade Marks Act has done a detailed survey of the provisions and thereafter proceeded to answer the question as to whether the suit against the registered proprietor of the design is maintainable and also attempted to answer about the maintainability of passing off action. The discussion pertaining to the same, finds mention in paragraphs 6 to 13 of the judgment which are reproduced hereinafter:- “6. First of all I presume for the sake of arguments in this case that tricycles produced by defendant no. I resemble the one manufactured by the plaintiff. The relevant provision of the Act under which an injunction can be issued or damages can be awarded is Section 53 which reds as under:  “53. Piracy of registered design. (1) During the existence of copyright in any design it shall not be lawful for any person- (a)  for the purpose of sale to apply or cause to be applied to any article in any class of goods in which the design is registered the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation, thereof , except with the licence or written consent of the registered proprietor, or to do anything with a view to enable the design to be so applied ; or  (aa) to import for the purposes of sale, without the consent of the registered proprietor, any article belonging to the class in which the design has been registered, and having applied to it the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof ; or,  (b)  knowing that the design or any fraudulent or obvious imitation thereof has been applied to any article in any class of goods in which the design is registered without the consent of the registered proprietor, to publish or expose or cause to be published or exposed for sale that article.  (2)  if any person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be liable for every contravention- (a)  to pay to the registered proprietor of the design a sum not exceeding five hundred rupees recoverable as a contract debt, or  (bb) if the proprietor elects to bring a suit for the recovery of damages for any such contravention, and for an injunction against the repetition thereof, to pay such damages as may be awarded and to be restrained by injunction accordingly : Provided that the total sum recoverable in respect of any one design under clause (a) shall not exceed one thousand rupees.  (3)  When the Court makes a decree in a suit under subsection (2), it shall send a copy of the decree to the Controller, who shall cause an entry thereof to be made in the register of designs.”  It is apparent from the same that an action for recovery of  damages and for issue of an injunction can be brought by the proprietor of a registered design. In the present case not only the plaintiff but defendant no.1 is also proprietor of registered design. Therefore each of the parties, in view of sub-section (2) of Section 53 of the Act is entitled to bring a suit for injunction and for recovery of damages against the other. That being so, obviously it will be absurd to issue injunction in favour of one of the parties to the suit restraining the other form using the registered design. The net result, therefore, is that when design of both the parties is registered, no action in the nature of issue of injunction or recover of damages is permissible.",

The answer is given by section 51-a of the act which reads as under :  “51-A (1) Any person interested may present a petition for the cancellation of the registration of a design- (a)  at any time after the registration of the design to the High Court on any one of the following grounds namely:- (i)  that the design has been previously registered in India ; or  (ii)  that it has been published in India prior to the date of registration ; or  (iii)  that the design is not a new or original design ; or  (b)  within one year from the date of the registration, to the Controller on either of the grounds specified in subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (a).  (2)  An appeal shall lie from any order of the Controller under this section to the High Court, and the Controller may at any time refer any such petition to the High Court and the High Court shall decide any petition so referred”.  That means that each of the parties can file application in the high court for cancellation of the registration of the other. It was stated by the counsel for the defendants at the Bar that the  defendant no. 1 had already filed such an application in this Court on 29th August, 1983.

                        "content": "The learned counsel for the plaintiff placed reliance on Section 47 of the act which reads as under :  “47. Copyright on registration. (1) when a design is registered the registered proprietor of the design shall, subject to the provisions of this act, have copyright in the design during five years from the date of registration.  (2)  If before the exertion of the said five ears application for the extension of the period of copyright is made to the controller in the prescribed manner, the Controller shall, on payment of the prescribed fee, extend the period of copyright for a second period of five years from the expiration of the original period of five years.  (3)  If before the expiration of such second period of five years application for the extension of the period of copyright is made to the Controller in the prescribed manner, the Controller may, subject to any rules under this Act, on payment of the prescribed fee, extend the period of copyright a third of five years from the expiration of the second period of five years.”  Learned counsel argues that it is apparent from a plain reading of that provision that it is the said provision which deals with the substantive right of a registered proprietor of a design, that the said substantive right of registered proprietor is for a period of 5 years initially which can be extended from time to time for a period of 5 years at a time, that on account of the fact that plaintiff obtained registration of the design of the tricycle earlier, the substantive right of the plaintiff having come into existence no right of the defendants could be acquired during the concurrency of the rights of the plaintiff and that, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to prevent the defendants from the piracy consisting of the use of the design of the plaintiff. Learned counsel also pointed out that if the legislature intended that an earlier registration should not prevail as against the later in  time, it would have been so provided in the Act as had been done in sub section (3) of Section 28 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958, which reds s under:",

His submission also is that in any case there is „passing off‟ of their tricycle by the defendants as the plaintiff on account of which alone the plaintiff issue of temporary injunction, as prayed for by him.",

Therefore, the net result is that firstly section 47 does not create any right of preference in favour of an earlier registration and section 53 does not provide for any remedy of injunction etc. with a view to enforce prevailing of earlier registration as against later ones.  The registration of a design can, therefore, prevail and is to be protected against infringement only when the opposite party does not possess any registration.

Therefore, no injunction can be issued on the ground that a defendant is likely to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiff. It will be worthwhile to mention that in ordinary cases of infringement of rights, the right to recovery of damages is not confined to any pecuniary limits but section 53 of the act imposes a maximum limit of Rs.1, 000/-for recovery of damages. This pecuniary limit having been provided in the particular law, i.e. the Designs act, therefore must prevail against the general or common law of not setting any limit or not providing any pecuniary limit to the recovery of damages.

                        "content": "The salient features of the view taken by Hon‟ble Justice G.R. Luthra are highlighted as under:- a)  That it first analyzes provisions of Section 53 of the Designs Act, 1911 in para 6 of the judgment.  b)  That it analyzes the provisions of piracy of Design vis-à-vis the provisions existing in the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 as to what can be the consequence when both the parties are registered proprietors of the trademark.  c)  That it also attempts to answer the question of passing off as it does take into consideration that the common law right is subservient to a particular Statute.  Although it does not discuss in extenso about the law laid down by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court way back in Kedar Nath (Supra) that the possibility of common law is ruled out where the subject is governed by the Statute but it does give a hint that the view taken by Hon‟ble Justice Luthra is based upon such principles. However, the said view was not approved in the case of Tobu Enterprises (P) Ltd Vs  M/s Joginder Metal Works and Anr. cited as AIR 1985 Delhi 244, wherein Hon‟ble Justice D.P. Wadhwa taking a different view has distinguished the case of Megha (supra) in the following manner:- “6. I do not think that the provisions of -S. 53 of the Act can be read as to exclude 'any fiction, for passing off and for rendition of accounts, A person complaining infringement of his design can certainly ask for accounts from the defendant to show the profits earned by the defendant by unlawfully using the design of the registered proprietor. The plaintiff might say that the profit earned by the defendant would be the loss sustained by him which he could claim as damages. It is not disputed that  damages can be claimed. The dispute is at best as to the method of assessing the damages. According to Mr. Vidhani, the plaintiff must claim a specific amount. In Russell-Clarke on Copyright in industrial Designs 5th edn. at pages 107, the learned authors have giventhe following heads under which damages might be claimed :  \"A. Where the defendant has made sales which the. plaintiff showed be would otherwise have made. the plaintiff is entitled to his loss of profits on the assumption that he would have made the sales in fact made by the defendant,  (B)  Where the defendant undercut the plaintiff's prices and the latter had to reduce his prices to compete, the plaintiff is entitled to be recompensed for the diminution in his profits.  C.  In case of sales by the defendant which the evidence shows the plaintiff would not himself have made, the plaintiff is entitled to a fair and proper royalty as the price or hire which should have been paid for the use of invention to legalise those sales.  As a general alternative to these methods, the patentee can if he wishes claim all his damages for sales made by the defendant on the basis of a fair and proper royalty.\"  Reference may also be made to another decision of the Bombay High Court in Calico Printers Association v. Savani & Co. . In the case, a suit was brought by the plaintiff alleging infringement of a design. The plaintiff prayed for injunction restraining the defendants from applying the registered design of the plaintff. The plaintiff also prayed that defendant be ordered to' deliver up to the plaintiff for destruction the goods bearing the design of the plaintiff which goods were in possession of the defendant. One of the contentions raised by the defendant was that the plaintiff was not entitled to the relief claimed regarding delivery up of the goods to the plaintiff for destruction. The argument as that a copyright is a statutory right and the remedies for the infringement of a copyright are also statutory and are contained in S. 53(2) (a) and-(b) of the Act. It was, therefore, submitted that as the Act provided the specific remedies for an infringement of a copyright no other remedy was available to the plaintiff or could be so granted by  the court. Negativing the contention of the defendant, the court, after referring to various decisions of the English courts, observed that, \"From these cases it is clear that the equitable remedies in respect of an infringement of a copyright are not excluded by the statute and the plaintiffs are entitled to ask for delivery up of the goods in suit to them for destruction.\" Mr. Vidhani then referred to an order of this court by 0. R. Luthra, J. in Tobu Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. Megha Enterprises & Anr. (IA No. 1480183 in Suit No. 473183, decided on 3-10-1983(3) where the learned Judge had observed that remedy against passing off was excluded under the Act. This order was passed in an interlocutory application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39, Rules 1 and 2, read with S. 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for issue of an injunction restraining the defendants from manufacturing, selling, officering for sale etc. or dealing in tricycles having the same design as of the plaintiff. The defendants in that case had also got their design registered under registration No. 152347. The learned Judge observed that not only the plaintiff but the defendant was also proprietor of a registered design and therefore each of the parties, in view of S. 53 of the Act, was entitled to bring a suit for injunction and for recovery of damages against the other. The learned Judge further observed \"That being so, obviously it will be absurd to issue injunction in favor of one of the parties to the suit restraining the other from using the registered design. The net result, therefore, is that when the design of both the parties is registered, no action in the nature of issue of injunction or recovery of damages is permissible.\" On facts, the learned Judge found that there was a lot of difference in the general appearance of the tricycles manufactured by the defendant. In this context, the learned Judge had examined the question as to what was the remedy if rights accrued on account of registration of design were infringed. He was of the opinion that the right against passing off was a common law right and that this common law right was subject to the provisions of a statute, he further observed \"In the present case. Section 53 of the Act deals with the remedy of injunction and claim of damages and rendition of accounts. That does not provide for any remedy against any alleged passing oft. Therefore, no injunction can be issued on the ground that a defendant is likely to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiff. .\" Then, finally it was observed \"Therefore, in  cases designs are registered under the Act, the doctrine of passing off has no application and that being so, the earlier registration or user cannot prevail against the later one.\"  No doubt the observations made by the learned Judge dp support the argument of Mr. Vidhani to some extent. However, as noted above, this order was made on an interim application and the issue which is before me in the present case could not be specifically there in those proceedings at that state. Moreover, the learned Judge himself said that the observations made in the order were only for deciding of the application and were not to affect the decision of the suit on merits. May be this was with reference to the findings arrived at for the purpose of the decision of the application for interim relief. The facts in that case were, however, different inasmuch as both the parties had claimed registration of their respective designs. The observations made in the order, therefore, cannot be said to have any binding force.”",

The learned counsel for defendant also cited M/s Tobu Enterprises Private Ltd. Vs M/s Megha Enterprises, 1983 PTC 359. In the said case, the two designs were found to be similar in nature and both designs had been registered. The Court held that Section 47 of the Designs Act does create a substantive right in favour of the person whose design is registered but mere earlier registration of a design would not prevail against a latter registration. The Court held that if rights accrued on account of registration of design are infringed, then remedy is provided under Section 53 of the Designs Act but that Section does not in any way give preference to the earlier registration as against the latter one. Therefore, the net result is that firstly Section 41 does not provide for any remedy of injunction, etc. with a view to enforce prevailing of earlier registration as against the latter ones.

AIR 1934 All. 798 (DB) and Qadar Bakhsh Vs Ghulam Mohd AIR 1934 Lahore 709, while departing the view of Tobu v. Megha (Supra) as well as Indo Asahi(Supra). The same finds mention in para 30 of the order in Alert India in the following manner:- “30. The case of the plaintiff is that the plaintiff are manufacturer of these goods, their goods are of superior quality, their sales are of Rs.50 lacs and their design is registered w.e.f. 11.10.1995 whereas the design of the defendants was registered on 4.3.1996. The plaintiff‟s design had obviously been already published when defendant started manufacturing and sale of the goods for which he got his design registered. If the two designs are same or identical in that case the defendant whose design was registered much later cannot be said to be proprietor of a new or original design not previously published in India. As has been held by Allahabad High Court and Lahore High Court, noticed earlier, a person claiming to be proprietor of a registered design which his not new or original and which is being used by others since prior to his resignation, of such design, notwithstanding such registration, is not entitled to legal remedies provided under section 53 of the Act. The defendant would not be entitled to seek legal remedies under section 53 of e Act against the plaintiff in case he was to  file a suit against the latter. Can such a registered design be availed by him as a shield in a suit filed by the plaintiff under section 53? In my view, the answer is to be in the negative. The defendant, if he is found to be a pirator of the design of the plaintiff, would not be entitled to defeat the just and legal right of the plaintiff available under the law. The plaintiff in that case would be entitled to relief of injunction under Section 53.”",

                        "content": "Thereafter, learned single judge proceeded to observe the view rendered in Tobu and Indo Asahi is incorrect/ erroneous. Again the said view taken by Hon‟ble Justice J. B. Goel although delves into the question of authorship and ownership of the designs which only comes into play when the court is empowered to examine the validity of design in infringement proceedings. It is seen by reading Section 22(3) of the Designs Act, 2000 or for that matter the corresponding provision of the old Act of 1911 that there are only limited powers to the court to examine the challenge which is laid as a matter of defence and not otherwise which means that the court can see the design registration of the plaintiff and cannot examine any certificate relied upon by the party in an infringement proceedings. Furthermore, it is only in infringement proceedings under section 22 (2) such powers under section 22 (3) can be invoked. If there are no infringement proceedings at the first place as the defendants being a registered proprietor will not fall within the ambit of “any person” then, the court cannot examine such validity by presuming that the infringement proceedings are maintainable. If that is so, then again the correctness of the view taken by learned Single Judge in Alert India becomes questionable.  Mr. Justice M.K. Sharma, learned Single Judge of this court has arrived at the conclusion that the passing off remedy is available basing upon the distinct right emanating from two distinct situations. The learned Single Judge observed thus:  Tobu Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. Megha Enterprises “13. Having arrived at the aforesaid finding it would thus be necessary during these proceedings to scrutinies and ascertain as to whether the plaintiffs have been able to prima facie show that there has been passing off by get up in relation to the OZETTE tooth brush having regard to the FLEX medal of the plaintiffs. At this stage it would also be necessary to deal with the contention of the counsel appearing for the defendants that no action for passing off could lie or be entertained in respect of a matter relating to design. According to the defendants the design law frowns upon monopolies as it is in public interest that inventions and improvements enter the public domain and are freely available for public use and therefore in such a situation public interest supersedes the individual interest of a person claiming ownership over intellectual properly. In support of the contention, the counsel for the respondent relied upon the decision of this court in ; reported in 1983 PTC 359. Relying on the said decision of this court learned counsel submitted that the definition of design as given under section 2(5) of the Designs Act having excluded the trade mark from its purview, the remedy against passing off is specifically excluded under the Act as there is no section similar to that of Section 27 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The aforesaid submission was considered by me after taking notice of the provisions of the Designs Act as also the decisions relied upon in respect of the said contention by the counsel appearing for the parties.  Rights under the registered design are set out in the Designs Act itself whereas the law of passing off is carved out under the Common Law Rights and therefore, both the rights are distinct and different. The contention of the counsel appearing for the respondents that there can be no monopoly in respect of a design is also without any merit for the provisions of the Design Act itself provide for having monopoly over such a design for a  Tobu Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. v. Joginder Metal  Works statutory period. Only after expiry of the aforesaid statutory period inventions and improvements go into the public domain and could be made freely available for public use but till then the inventor or the registered owner of the design have a monopoly over the said design in terms of the provisions of the Design Act. The Plea that concept of passing off cannot be made applicable to a case of design is also equally without merit. As delineated above, the registered design and Common Law rights are distinct and different rights arising from two different situations. Infringement right accrues on the basis of the provisions of the Design Act whereas the passing off rights accrue on the basis of Common Law rights. It is true that there is no similar section to that of section 27 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act in the Design Act. Section 27(2) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act gives a statutory recognition to the passing off rights making the said rights a statutory right as well but that does not mean that in absence of a similar provision to that of the provisions of Section 27 in the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act the right of passing off would not be available to a case of design. If such a right is available to someone under the Common Law rights that could well be enforced even though the same is not statutorily recognised under a Statute. In this connection reference may be made to a subsequent decision of this court in ; . I am, therefore, inclined to hold that passing off action is also available to case of design and such right could be enforced provided the same is available in accordance with law even in a case of design, for otherwise a latitude would be given to a manufacturer to misrepresent and to deceive unwary customers by manufacturing and selling its products as that of products of some other manufacturer or seller. Such course would also allow unscrupulous manufacturer or dealer to take recourse o confusing the unwary customer/public to purchase some goods which it was unwilling to purchase but being deceived and/or confused proceeded to purchase the same believing it to be products and goods manufactured and sold by the actual manufacturer or dealer.”(Emphasis Supplied).",

Aftab Ahmad and Ors., 2007(37) PTC 299(Del) by Hon‟ble Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed, the view taken in Alert India (supra) has been approved. The Hon‟ble Judge observes as under:- “13. Furthermore, not much turns on the factum of the defendant being the registered proprietor of the design under registration no.198624. Firstly, the registration of the plaintiff‟s design is prior in time. The plaintiff‟s design was registered on 23.2.2004, whereas the defendants‟ design was registered on 1.3.2005. The fact that the plaintiff‟s registration is prior in time to that of the defendants‟ would entitle the plaintiff to prevent its infringement by the defendants. In Alert India (supra), a learned single Judge of this court held that a design registered later would not be entitled to protection against the first or prior registered proprietor of a design.  Secondly, it must be kept in mind that the registration of a design under the said Act is procedurally different from the registration granted under the Patents Act, 1970 and/or the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Under both the Patents Act and the Trade Marks Act, prior to registration there is a substantive examination, publication before registration and provision for opposition before registration. These are all absent in the case of a registration of a design under the said Act. Therefore, mere registration of the design by the defendants would not confer a higher right (or even an equal right) on them than that available to the plaintiff. Thirdly, the design employed by the defendants, prima facie, is an obvious imitation of the plaintiff‟s design right up to the measurements of the various features as indicated above. Even the colour is similar”",

But, it is still to be looked into as where are the  discussions relating to three pillars (as mentioned in Megha (supra)) on the basis of which, it can be said conclusively that the suit against the registered proprietor is not maintainable as it is purely a statutory remedy and does not entitle to the Court to look into the validity of the defendant‟s registration howsoever bad or good it may be. All these discussions do not find mention in any of the judgments mentioned above as view after view has been approved in one case or the other and never ever an occasion has come to analyze the same from the very beginning.",

As noticed hereinabove, the claims under a patent having an earlier priority date have specific protection against any claim for patent having a later priority date. This is a fundamental difference in the present case, when compared to the statement of law contained in Tobu Enterprises (Supra) pertaining to the Designs Act, 1911. Consequently, the decision in Tobu Enterprises (Supra) in any case cannot be relied upon in a case governed by the Patents Act.

While it is true that the applicant/ plaintiff holds registration of their flask under design registration nos.174903 and 174904, as borne out by the plaint documents, it is equally true that Mr. Raman Gupta, the partner of the first defendant, also holds the registration of the design of the vacuum flask manufactured by the first respondent, as disclosed by document No.3 filed on the side of the respondents. It is claimed by both parties that both parties have filed applications before the controller of Designs for the cancellation of the registration of each other and the proceedings are pending.

Therefore, no proprietor of the registered trademark can complain of infringement of his registered trade mark by another, if the other person uses his own registered trade mark. A similar provision does not exist in the Designs Act, 2000.

In those times too, the situation like both the parties were registered proprietor arose and in the case of Western Engineering Company vs America Lock Company, ILR 1973 Delhi 177 the learned Single Judge Justice D. Kapur observed thus:  “As regards the third case, namely, the suit for injunction and damages brought by M/s. Western Engineering Company against M/s. America Lock Company, which is based on infringement of the registered design of the former, it is necessary to say that the result of that suit is largely dependent on the conclusions I reach on the two revocation applications before me. At present both parties have registered designs and the question of infringement does not arise. If both designs are revoked, then the suit will fail, but if the design of M/s. America Lock Company is revoked and that M/s. Western Engineering Company is maintained, then the suit  will be maintainable. Hence, the decision in the suit depends largely on the result of the two applications for revocation.”  It is altogether different matter that the learned Single Judge then proceeded to decide the cancellation as empowered by the old Act 1911 under section 51A wherein High Court could entertain the cancellation proceedings. But after the amendment and enactment of 2000 Act, as per the Design Act 2000, the powers to hear cancellation vests before the Controller General of Designs and the High Court powers are in a away divested to hear cancellation petition, thus the High Court in a limited sense in a defence to an infringement suit as per section 22 (3) can examine the validity of the Designs. But that does not mean that the said power can be equated with that of the cancellation.  If, Section 22 (3) power is equated with that of the uncontrolled power to cancel the design and maintainability of infringement suit despite both the parties are registered proprietor would lead to Court conferring the powers of cancellation and High Court shall culminate into the cancellation court. It is only in a limited sense, the said powers are provided to examine it as a defence and not in all cases to proceed to scrutinize the design. So if that view is to be believed, then till the time, one of the Design is cancelled, the suit for infringement cannot proceed and cancellation will lie only before the Controller as per the new Act. This is another reason why I am taking the view in the present case.",

Megha would be giving a leverage to the Piracy. In my humble opinion, this view is correct to the extent that Design Act provides a low level of scrutiny by not providing a examination procedure at the time of filing of Design Application and no doubts can be expressed on that count. But if the powers of the court are themselves limited by the word of the statute and the same are statutory in nature wherein there is no room for sentiments or equity left over, then the court is left with nothing but to relegate the parties to the  cancellation court where such scrutiny can take place. If the courts are empowered to examine the validity in a limited sense as a matter of defence, then court will perform its duty as per the powers provided and prescribed under the Act. Giving a preference to one set of individuals over the other on the grounds of equity would be again going into the domain of equitable principles when they are not legislatively engrafted or saved.

The legislation or amendment is a domain of the legislature which it has to perform.

The power to legislate has not been conferred on the Court.  Ajaib Singh vs. Sirhind Co- operative Marketing-cum-Processing Service Society Ltd. &  Similarly in the case of Anr., AIR 1999 SC 1351, the Supreme Court held that Court cannot fix a period of limitation, if not fixed by the legislature, the Courts can admittedly interpret the law and do not make laws. The Court cannot interpret the statutory provision in such a manner which would amount to legislation intentionally left over by the legislature. (Emphasis Supplied)",

Sir,  I am directed to refer to your letter dated the 29th October, 2003 on the subject mentioned above and to say that the request contained  therein has been examined in this office in consultation with Integrated Finance Wing.

The qualification and experience prescribed in the RRs for the post of Industrial Designer/Asstt. Industrial Designer in SIDO do not seem to satisfy the above conditions and hence there is no justification for incorporation the provision regarding benefit of added years of service in the RRs for the post of AID/ID, Shri Bhowmick may be informed accordingly.
