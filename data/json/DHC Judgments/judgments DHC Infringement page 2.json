The claim of parity with subvention scheme  matters is found to be bald, unsubstantiated and contrary to the facts disclosed.  7 Clause 1 – TCHFL will make disbursement of the sanctioned loan by making payment to the Developer directly on behalf of the Purchaser in installments in the manner provided in the Agreement to Sell and upon specific written request of the Purchaser subject to the Loan Agreement entered into between the Purchaser and TCHFL and the covenants hereunder agreed to among the parties hereto and any payment made to the Developer shall be deemed to be payments made to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall, in each case, be liable for the amount of the loan disbursed on his/her/their behalf to the Developer as though the same had been disbursed directly to Purchaser. It is further agreed by the Purchaser that TCHFL shall not be responsible or liable to ensure or ascertain the progress of construction and mere demand for payment would be sufficient for TCHFL to effect disbursement as aforesaid.  8 Clause 2.4 -Disbursement – (a) TCHFL may, subject to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent set out in Article 4 of this Agreement and subject to the Borrower making a disbursement request to TCHFL in the form and manner as set out under Schedule G hereto, disburse the Loan, directly to the builder or to the developer or to the society or to the vendor or in favour of any third party or person as may be directed by the Borrower. The disbursement schedule as requested by the Borrower at the time of execution of this Agreement is as annexed as Schedule F hereto. The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably authorizes TCHFL to disburse the Loan as per Schedule F attached hereto provided the conditions precedent set out in Article 4 of this Agreement have been fulfilled and the Borrower has made a disbursement by writing a letter informing TCHFL of its intention to do so at least 7 (seven) days prior to any scheduled Disbursement Date/event as provided in Schedule F hereto. In the event that the disbursement is in accordance with this clause, the Borrower agrees and acknowledges that the Borrower shall indemnify and keep TCHFL indemnified against all actions, suits, proceedings and all costs, charges, expenses, losses or damages which may be incurred or suffered by TCHFL by reason of any disbursement request or counter instruction given by the Borrower. Notwithstanding the above, TCHFL shall have the right to stop further disbursement of the Loan at any time if TCHFL is of the opinion that as a result of change in circumstances there has been a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower’s financial condition or profits or business and of any material change in the Borrower’s business. It is hereby clarified that TCHFL may, at the request of the Borrower, in its sole discretion, amend the schedule of disbursement as provided in Schedule F attached hereto by either increasing the period over which disbursements may be made by TCHFL or by reducing the same, subject to fulfilment by the Borrower of such additional conditions as TCHFL may stipulate in this regard. In the event the Schedule is an event based schedule, TCHFL shall not be responsible for verifying the happening of such events. TCHFL shall be entitled to disburse monies under this Agreement based on certification/ intimation of happening of  such event from the builder, contractor, developer or other person, as the case may be.",

No demonstrable irregularity has been shown in the grant of sanction of loan by TCHFL. The claims made in the petition do not indicate any cause of action qua the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, UOI. It is therefore evident that UOI and RBI have been impleaded only to overcome the bar of maintainability.",
