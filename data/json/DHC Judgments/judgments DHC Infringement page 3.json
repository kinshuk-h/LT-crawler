The test for comparison of the two marks  has been laid down by the Supreme Court Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, wherein it has been held as under:  “7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshman-dhara” are in use in respect of the same description of goods, namely a medicinal preparation for the alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As we said in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd. [(1960) (1) SCR 968] the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara” is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words as “current of nectar” or “current of Lakshman”. He would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see the difference between “current of nectar” and “current of Lakshman”. “Current of Lakshman” in a literal sense has no meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the inference that the “current or  stream” is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. He would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.",

                        "content": "We agree that the use of the word “dhara” which literally means “current or stream” is not by itself decisive of the matter. What we have to consider here is the overall similarity of the composite words, having regard to the circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations of the same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because unusually stupid people, “fools or idiots”, may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of difference, but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name. The trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be considered. In the case of the application to register “Erectiks” (opposed by the proprietors of the trade mark “Erector”) Farwell, J., said in William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52 RPC 137] : “I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a part of the other word; one word must be considered as a whole and compared with the other word as a whole…. I think it is a dangerous method to adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a portion of the other word.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

The said provision further stipulates that when a manufacturer transgresses the maximum limit of 10%, it shall be liable to reduce the price of the drug to the level which prevailed in the preceding twelve months and maintain it at that level for the next twelve months.

                        "content": "In the case of Bard, the NPPA in its order of 22 October 2020 has observed as follows: - ―5. The submissions made by the company have been examined carefully and found not tenable in view of the following reasons:  (a)  As per the provisions of Para 20 of the DPCO, 2013, no manufacturer can increase the maximum retail price of a 'drug‘ more than ten percent of maximum retail price in preceding twelve months and where the increase beyond ten percent of maximum retail price by whatsoever reasons, it shall reduce the same to the level of ten percent of maximum retail price and maintain the same for next twelve  months to become eligible for next increase in MRP as per prescribed limit.  Considering above provision, any subsequent increase in MRP after the default, whether increase is within permissible limit or not, would not be allowed until and unless MRP is revised downward within the prescribed limit of 10% and maintain the same for next twelve months. Thus, overcharging would be considered from the date of default to the date of compliance of this provision. Hence, contention of the company for subsequent notional increases is liable to be rejected.  As far as the judgment of M/s Obsurge is concerned, it is informed that the contention of the Company does not seem to be correct. It may be noted that the question of subsequent notional interest was not the substantial or direct question involved in the M/s Obsurge and therefore the Hon'ble High Court did not consider the same in its Order. The judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the above referred case as stated in the Para 13 is reproduced hereunder:  \"I need not consider the above submission as in any case, the case of the Respondents is not that it has allowed the Petitioner the subsequent increase of MRP by exercising its power under Paragraph-20(2) of the DPCO, 2013. Therefore, the said question would not be relevant in the present case\".  (b)  Interest on overcharged amount is levied under Para 20(2) of the DPCO, 2013 read with Section 7A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The above provision provides mandatory levying of interest on overcharged amount from the date of default  As far as the applicability of the judgment of M/s T.C Healthcare is concerned, the Court judgment quoted by the company is not applicable in the instant case due to the different and explicit provisions of the DPCO, 2013 from DPCO, 1995. The above referred judgment is applicable for DPCO, 1995. Para 20(2) of the DPCO, 2013 read with Section 7A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 provides mandatory provision of levying interest on overcharged amount from the date of default. Therefore, the contention of the Company with respect to the applicability of M/s T.C Healthcare in this present case is misconstrued and inconceivable. Hence, the same is also liable to be rejected.  (c)  As regard the contradiction in applicability of the provisions of Para 20(2) of the DPCO, 2013 and Section 7A of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is concerned, it is informed that the interpretation suggested by the Company is misconceived and  untenable. There is no contradiction in the aforesaid provisions, in fact; they are complimentary to each other.  The rule of Harmonious construction shall be applicable in this situation. In other words, the Para 20(2) of DPCO, 2013 prescribes Overcharged amount along with interest thereon from the date of increase in price in addition to the penalty.  Section 7A of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 comes in the case of default committed by the company in non-compliance of the Orders issued under the provisions of Para 20(2) of DPCO, 2013. Therefore, both the provision are complimentary to each other and the contention of the company with regards to the contradiction of the provisions of DPCO, 2013 and Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is misconceived and untenable hence liable to be rejected.  (d)  In view of the above, the computation of demand submitted by the company by taking subsequent notional increases is not acceptable and hence liable to be rejected.  Based on the above cited reasons, the contention of the company is not acceptable, hence rejected. It was obligatory for the company to follow the provision of Para 20 of the DPCO, 2013 in letter and spirit.",

The case of Bard principally is that the respondents had failed to put in place a mechanism for disclosure of prices in respect of medical devices. It was argued that the 2013 DPCO as well as the attendant forms essentially dealt with pharmaceutical formulations. It  was also contended that up to 24 January 2017 the respondents had also not constructed a database for monitoring of prices of medical devices nor did the industry itself have a mechanism to report price data. On 24 January 2017 a proforma for price list (Form V) for drugs falling under Schedule II of the 2013 DPCO came to be notified. The aforesaid notification was followed by an Office Memorandum4 of 12 May 2017 issued by the NPPA requiring medical device manufacturers to provide pricing data with respect to 19 medical devices. Para 3 of the said O.M. recorded that NPPA had developed a format for submission of data and had shared the same with medical device companies and associations. Bard contends that it was in terms of the aforesaid O.M. that NPPA for the first time lent clarity with respect to medical devices to which the 2013 DPCO would be applicable and sought pricing data from manufacturers.",

It would be pertinent to note that the two non-scheduled formulations in respect of which an  allegation of overcharging came to be laid were Histoglob and U-Tryp. On 03 January 2017, the NPPA issued a preliminary notice observing that Bharat Serums had increased the MRP of Histoglob by more than 10% during the period September 2014 to September 2015. It accordingly called upon the said petitioner to respond and to submit the requisite records. The allegations in this preliminary notice were based on the respondents noting that while the price of Histoglob in September 2014 stood at Rs. 82.50/-, in September 2015 the same had come to be raised to Rs. 91/-. Another notice dated 09 January 2017, thereafter came to be issued in respect of U-Tryp. Here too the allegation leveled was of a MRP having breached the permissible 10% during the period January 2015 to December 2016. Bharat Serums while responding to the aforesaid notices pointed out that the MRP for Histoglob after factoring in the permissible 10% increase would have come to Rs. 90.75/-. It submitted that since it would have been impossible for a consumer to pay the aforesaid price, it had merely rounded it off to Rs. 91/-. It its written submissions, Bharat Serums has placed a comparative chart indicating the permissible price under the 2013 DPCO, the price actually charged by it and the permissible MRP which has been taken note of by NPPA in the impugned demand notice which came to be issued. The two charts relating to Histoglob and U-Tryp are set out hereinbelow: - “Histoglob  U-Tryp",

On 20 April 2018 NPPA issued a show cause notice alleging that Bharat Serums had violated the provisions of Para 20 insofar as Histoglob was concerned, since it had sold the said drug at a price of Rs. 91/-against the permissible maximum retail price of Rs. 90.75/-.

It reiterated its original stand that it had never intended to overcharge or violate the provisions of Para 20 and that it had only rounded off the MRP bearing in mind the practical difficulties which would have been faced by consumers if they were asked to pay a retail price running into decimals. On 26 June 2018, the NPPA issued a demand notice calling upon Bharat Serums to pay a sum of Rs. 2,04,97,767/-towards the overcharging of Histoglob. A similar demand notice came to be issued in respect of U-Tryp with the respondents alleging that Bharat Serums would be liable to pay an aggregate sum of Rs. 4,81,09,809/-. It is these two demand notices,  which have been challenged by Bharat Serums in its two writ petitions. To complete the narration of facts, it may be additionally, noticed that this Court by its orders of 31 July 2018 and 06 August 2018 had placed the impugned demand notices in abeyance.",

Learned senior counsel argued that Para 20 nowhere contemplates the rolled back price being frozen till such time as the infraction is cured. According to learned senior counsel, the respondents  have committed a patent error in interpreting Para 20 as mandating the revised price being liable to be maintained till such time as the overcharging is cured. According to Mr. Sibal, the view expressed by the respondents in the impugned order effectively amounts to a rescripting of Para 20 and the creation of a penalty which is not even envisaged therein.",

Stress was laid by Mr. Sibal on the admitted position that in terms of the 2013 DPCO, the respondents can fix the price of scheduled formulations only.

Mr. Sibal highlighted the fact that the respondents in the case of Bard have calculated the overcharged amount on the basis of a notionally reduced MRP for the entire period from January 2015 to January 2018.

It was submitted that holding Bard liable to pay interest @ 15% from the date of contravention till November 2019 is clearly illegal. Learned senior counsel would contend that interest can be charged only from the date of default of payment of any amount that may be computed and demanded by the respondents. Learned senior counsel drew the attention of the Court to the provisions made in Section 7A of the Act to submit that a manufacturer becomes liable to pay interest only if it fails to pay an amount quantified in terms of an order that may be made under Section 3 and defaults in paying or complying with a consequential  demand that may be raised. Reliance in this respect was placed on the decision rendered by the Allahabad High Court in M/s T.C. Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. vs. Union of India7 , where the following observations came to be made: - 5 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1744  6 the Act  “The liability to pay interest has been specifically provided under Section 7-A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Section 7-A(1) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 is quoted as below : - ―7-A. Power of Central Government to recover certain amounts as arrears of land revenue [or as a public demand]. (1) Where any person, liable to - (a)  pay any amount in pursuance of any order made under Section 3, or  (b)  deposit any amount to the credit of any Account or Fund constituted by or in pursuance of any order made under that section,  makes any default in paying or depositing the whole or any part of such amount, the amount in respect of which such default has been made shall [whether such order was made before or after the commencement of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 1984, and whether the liability of such person to pay or deposit such amount arose before or after such commencement] be recoverable by Government together with simple interest due thereon computed at the rate of [fifteen per cent] per annum, from the date of such default to the date of recovery of such amount, as an arrear of land revenue [or as a public demand].‖  Section 7A of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 contemplates recovery by Government with simple interest on the due amount in case any default is committed in payment by a person liable to pay any amount. The order has been passed in this case by respondent No. 2 directing for deposit of overcharge amount by orders dated 12th September, 2008 and 24th October, 2008. The said orders direct deposit of the said amount within fifteen days from issue of the letter failing which recovery proceedings under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 were to be initiated. The default of the petitioner to pay overcharge amount shall arise after fifteen days from issue of the order. The liability to pay simple interest shall arise after a default is  committed as per Section 7A(1). Thus no interest could have been charged prior to issue of the order dated 12th September, 2008 and 24th October, 2008. The orders dated 12th September, 2008 and 24th October, 2008 insofar as it demands respective amount towards interest cannot be sustained.  7 2010 SCC OnLine All 834  In the second writ petition an interim order was passed on 10th February, 2009 providing that no coercive action shall be taken by the respondents against the petitioners in the meantime. Subsequently by an order dated 28th May, 2009 after hearing the respondents the stay application was disposed of modifying the interim order dated 10th February, 2009 to the extent that subject to petitioners depositing 50% of the amount as determined by orders dated 12th September, 2008 and 24th October, 2008 further recovery against the petitioners shall remain stayed. After passing of the interim orders, the petitioners claim to have deposited an amount of Rs. 9,01,45,215/-by demand draft dated 18th June, 2009.  In view of what has been said above, the overcharge amount to be recovered from the petitioners in the second writ petition needs to be recalculated in the light of the observations made above. The respondents while re-calculating the amount of overcharge to be realised from the petitioners shall adjust the amount already deposited by the petitioners indicated above.‖",

The wording of Section 7A EC Act makes it clear that the interest has to be paid in the event of default committed by the drug manufacturer in not paying the demand within time. When a fixed time is prescribed for making payment of demand, as has been done in the instant case by the impugned demand letter dated 27th November, 2008 which requires BLPL to make payment by 5th December, 2008, the failure to pay the amount will arise only after the expiry of that date and not earlier.

Mr. Sibal submitted that the proforma for price list in respect of medical devices was formulated and notified only on 24 January 2017. Prior to the said notification, Mr. Sibal argued, that there was a complete lack of clarity amongst manufacturers of medical devices with respect to the applicability of the 2013 DPCO.

Learned counsel highlighted the key principles which were enumerated and adopted in terms of that Policy and which were explained to be the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices and the regulatory regime moving to a market-based pricing system as opposed to a cost-based pricing formula which formed the foundation for the Drug Price Control Order 199510 . Mr. Shah laid emphasis on Para 4(xii) of the Policy and submitted that it embodied a clear intent of the respondents to leave nonessential drugs out of the price control regime with their prices being liable to be fixed as per market forces. Mr. Shah submitted that the ultimate provisions which form part of Para 20 are an adoption of the Policy measures which were formulated in Para 4(xii). The aforesaid paragraph is reproduced hereinbelow: - “4. (xii) Non-price Control Drugs: … In the proposed policy, all essential drugs are under price control. It would follow that nonessential drugs should not be under a controlled regime and their prices should be fixed by market forces. However, in order to keep a check on overall drug prices, it is proposed that prices of such drugs be monitored on regular basis, and where such price increase at a rate of  above 10% per annum is observed, the Government would be empowered to have the price of these drugs reduced to below this limit, for next twelve months.‖",

                        "content": "Turning then to the provisions of Para 20 itself, Mr. Shah contended that it is evident that a manufacturer of non-scheduled formulations is entitled to increase the MRP of drugs annually subject to the singular rider of ensuring that the increase does not exceed more than 10% of the MRP which had prevailed in the preceding twelve months. According to Mr. Shah, this right which stands so conferred on a manufacturer of nonscheduled formulations is not made dependent upon the manufacturer in any particular year overcharging or exceeding the band of 10% as fixed under Para 20. In other words, learned counsel would submit that the manufacturer does not stand deprived of the right to claim such periodic revisions merely because he may have violated that stipulation in a particular year. It was pointed out by Mr. Shah that the consequences which a manufacturer must suffer are clearly set out in the latter part of Para 20 which stipulates that in case it has overcharged, the manufacturer would have to reduce the price of the drug to bring it at par with the MRP which had prevailed in the preceding twelve months. Mr. Shah points out that the said provision additionally prescribes that the manufacturer as a consequence of overcharging, would also have to hold the price of the particular drug at the reduced price for the next twelve months. Mr. Shah submits that the third consequence which stands attached to overcharging is the liability of the manufacturer to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest. It was the submission of learned counsel that the phrases “preceding twelve months” and “next twelve months” as are employed in  Para 20 are critical to understanding its scope and intent. According to learned counsel it is these two phrases which constitute the pivotal and focal points for the purposes of understanding the liability which may come to be imposed upon a manufacturer as a consequence of overcharging.",

According to Mr. Shah the power to monitor can only be understood as empowering the respondents to oversee and ensure that manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations do not increase retail prices of such drugs beyond the permissible 10%. According to Mr. Shah, the right of the manufacturer to increase the price of non-scheduled formulations is separate and distinct and not subject to the penal consequences which are comprised in the latter part of Para 20. Learned counsel explains the right of a manufacturer to increase the price of drugs in accord with the provisions of Para 20 to be “continual” and “sequential”. According to learned counsel even if a manufacturer were to transgress the provisions made in Para 20, it would always be open to NPPA to take immediate action and call upon the manufacturer to roll back the price of the drug in question. It was vehemently urged that even if an infraction of Para 20 comes to be discovered many years after the date of the alleged transgression it is the twin phrases “preceding twelve months” and “next twelve months” which would govern the issue of liability of a manufacturer. The submission in essence was that even if a manufacturer has infringed the injunct placed by Para 20, it would not take away its right to claim a  continual and sequential increase of the MRP of a drug. It was additionally argued that the price revision which would have to be mandatorily made by the manufacturer would also have to be with reference to the date of alleged violation and the ―preceding twelve months‖ and ―next twelve months‖ being calculated in conjunction with that date. Mr. Shah argued that the respondents would, in any case, not be justified to freeze the price of a particular drug for the preceding and the next twelve months from the date when an infraction may come to be discovered.  10 1995 DPCO",

Mr. Shah argued that the power to monitor prices as conferred on authorities under various statutes has never been recognised to extend to or be equated with a price fixation power. In support of his submission, reliance was placed on the following observations as made by this Court in Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board v. Indraprastha Gas Ltd., 12  ―11. We are of the opinion that none of the aforesaid clauses can be construed as prescribing price control/regulation as a function of the Board. Clause (a) supra while prescribing protection of interest of consumers limits the same to, by fostering fair trade and competition amongst entities engaged in distributing, dealing, transporting, marketing gas. The function of the Board thereunder is of regulating the inter se relationship of entities under the Act and not to regulate/control the relationship between the entities under the Act and the consumers. Similarly, Clause (f) while prescribing function of monitoring prices limits the same to taking corrective measures to prevent restrictive trade practices by the entities. Thus only if the Board finds that the marketeers of gas in a particular area have formed a cartel or are indulging in any other restrictive trade practices, is the Board empowered to monitor prices. Such is not the case of the Board in the present instance. The petitioner even though till date the exclusive marketeer of gas in Delhi, has not been accused of any restrictive trade practice and the power exercised also is not in the name of monitoring price. Another sub-clause of clause (f) of Section 11 confers function on the Board to ensure display of information about Maximum Retail Price. Again, had the intent of the legislature been to confer the power on the Board to fix the Maximum Retail Price, nothing prevented the legislature from providing so expressly. Instead, functions of enforcing retail service obligations and marketing service obligations only have been conferred by the legislature. The definition of retail service obligations and marketing service obligations in Sections 2(zk) and (w) also do not include obligation to sell at the prices fixed by the Board.",

Price fixation/regulation/control is essentially a clog on the freedom of trade and commerce conferred the status of a fundamental right. However wherever the circumstances so  justify, the same has been treated as a reasonable restriction. However such restriction on fundamental right has to be by legislative mandate only. The Supreme Court recently in DLF Universal Ltd. v. Director, Town and Country Planning Department, Haryana (2010) 14 SCC 1, finding no provision in the statute (Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975) empowering the Director to fix the sale price, held directions fixing the sale price to be beyond the limits laid down by the empowering Act and suffering from lack of power and void. It was observed that an order which is not within the powers given by the empowering Act, has no legal legs to stand on and is a nullity. It was further held that a power of imposing restrictions on profit percentages, time limit on construction and handing over of such construction does not encompass within itself the right to exercise power in manner that inhibits terms of contract and freedom granted therein. Similarly, in O.N.G.C. v. Association of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of Gujarat AIR 1990 SC 1851 it was observed that price fixation is a legislative function. Even the seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Prag Ice & Oil Mills v. Union of India (1978) 3 SCC 459 had observed that unless by the terms of a particular statute, price fixation is made a quasi-judicial function, it is really legislative in character. The Supreme Court in Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited v. Sai Renewable Power (P) Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC 34 also opined that fixation of tariff is a statutory function, to be performed by a statutory authority in furtherance of the provisions of the relevant laws; finding the Electricity Act, 2003 to be requiring the appropriate Commission to determine the tariff, it was held to be empowered to do so. In contrast, the Board with which we are concerned in the present case, as aforesaid is not found to have been assigned the function of fixing the Network Tariff or the Compression Charges as it has purported to do. The Supreme Court in U.P. Power Corp. Ltd. v. NTPC Ltd. (2009) 6 SCC 235 has held that regulatory provisions are required to be applied having regard to the nature, textual context and situational context of each statute.  12 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3215",

State of Haryana (2003) 5 SCC 622 held that a regulatory Act must be construed having regard to the purpose it seeks to achieve and a statutory authority cannot ask for something which is not contemplated under the statute. The statute in that case relating to regulation of user of land was construed to be not imposing any limitation prohibiting transfer of land not affecting its user. It would thus be seen that the powers of regulation under a statute were held to be not unlimited and a right of regulation was held to be confined to the language of the statute and not all pervasive. The basic rule of interpretation of statutes that the Court shall not go beyond the statute unless it is absolutely necessary so to do and that purposive construction would be resorted to only when literal interpretation leads to manifest injustice or absurdity, was applied. In our view the principle applied therein holds good in the facts of the present case also. Merely because the Board has been conferred with regulatory powers will not be interpreted to empower the Board to exercise powers which the statute has not conferred on it.‖",

Learned counsel submitted that it is the interest of the consumer and not the producer which must be countenanced as being the determinative factor for the purposes of interpreting the provisions of the 2013 DPCO.

Union of India14 in the following terms: - ―65. If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit, there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business by imposing reasonable restrictions. The question of fair price to the consumer with reference to the dominant, object and purpose of the legislation claiming equitable distribution and availability at fair price is completely lost sight of if profit and the producer's return are kept in the forefront. The maintenance or increase of supplies of the commodity or the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices are the  fundamental purposes of the Act. If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer to recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of infringement of fundamental right can be said to arise.‖  13 The Act  14 (1974) 1 SCC 468",

All the tests of validity of the impugned price control or fixation order are, therefore, to be found in Section 3 of the Act. Section 3 makes necessity or expediency of a control older for the purpose of maintaining or increasing supplies of an Essential Commodity or for securing its equitable distribution at fair prices the criteria of validity. It is evident that an assessment of either the expediency or necessity of a measure, in the light of all the facts and circumstances which have a bearing on the subjects of price fixation, is essentially a subjective matter. It is true that objective criteria may enter into determinations of particular selling prices of each kilogram of mustard oil at various times. But, there is no obligation here to fix the price in such a way as to ensure reasonable profits to the producer or manufacturer. It has also to be remembered that the object is to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices so that it is the interest of the consumer and not of the producer which is the determining factor in applying any objective tests at any particular time. Hence, the most important objective fact in fixing the price of mustard oil, which is consumed generally by large masses of people of limited means, is the paying capacity of the average purchaser or consumer.  xxxx  xxxx  xxxx",

The language of paragraph 20(1) of the DPCO, 2013 is unambiguous. It proscribes the manufacturer from raising a Maximum Retail Price (MRP) beyond 10% of the MRP as existing during the preceding twelve months. There is no scope for the petitioner to make any adjustment on account of the preceding periods for which MRP has not been raised. It is also relevant to observe that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy, 2012 brought about a paradigm shift in the administration of the ceiling prices from a cost based price regime to a price determined by the market force. Although, in terms of the DPCO, 2013, the ceiling prices are required to be fixed only for scheduled formulations, the prices of other drugs are also required to be monitored. This monitoring of the prices is also based on the market forces, and a manufacturer is free to fix the MRP with the restriction that the same cannot be increased beyond 10%, over and above the MRP fixed in the preceding twelve months. This is to ensure that the there is no runaway increase in the prices of the drugs. Thus, in cases where a manufacturer is compelled to peg up the MRP on market forces, it would militate against the very object of paragraph 20(1) of DPCO, 2013 to permit such a manufacturer to increase a price beyond 10%, taking into account the period for which such manufacturer was constrained to peg the MRP at a price below the permissible increase.‖",

It was submitted that the moment a breach of Para 20 is discovered, the price of the non-scheduled formulation would have to be necessarily rolled back to the permissible MRP and from the year of default till the transgression is ultimately cured, the manufacturer would be liable to hold prices at that level. It was the categorical case of the respondents, and one which was also explained in the illustrations extracted above, that the liability of a manufacturer to revise and roll back prices of a particular drug would have to revert to the year of default and the price thereafter maintained for the entire period till the default may be ultimately cured or a demand raised. According to Mr. Singh, during this period where the manufacturer is statutorily obliged to rectify its conduct, it cannot claim a notional increase of the MRP by 10%.",

He would  contend that a transgression of Para 20, which essentially constitutes the breach of a civil obligation, does not require mens rea to be proved or established. Mr. Singh referred to the following pertinent observations as made by the Supreme Court in SCM Solifert Ltd. v. CCI,19 :- 18 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7366  ―23. There was no requirement of mens rea under Section 43-A or an intentional breach as an essential element for levy of penalty. The Act does not use the expression ―the failure has to be wilful or mala fide‖ for the purpose of imposition of penalty. The breach of the provisions of the Act is punishable and considering the nature of the breach, it is discretionary to impose the extent of penalty. Mens rea is important to adjudge criminal or quasi-criminal liability, not in case of violation of the civil statutory provision.",

In our opinion, mens rea is not an essential ingredient for contravention of the provisions of a civil act. In our view, the penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and, therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes immaterial. In other words, the breach of a civil obligation which attracts penalty under the provisions of an Act would immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the fact whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with any guilty intention or not. This apart, unless the language of the statute indicates the need to establish the element of mens rea, it is generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying with the statute has occurred … the penalty has to follow and only the quantum of penalty is discretionary.…  ***",

                        "content": "―Mens rea‖ is a state of mind. Under the criminal law, mens rea is considered as the ―guilty intention‖ and unless it is found that the ‗accused‘ had the guilty intention to commit the ‗crime‘ he cannot be held ‗guilty‘ of committing the crime. An ‗offence‘ under Criminal Procedure Code and the General Clauses Act, 1897 is defined as any act or omission ―made punishable by any law for the time being in force‖. The proceedings under Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 are ‗adjudicatory‘ in nature and character and are not ―criminal proceedings‖. The officers of the Enforcement Directorate and other administrative authorities are expressly empowered by the Act to ‗adjudicate‘ only. Indeed they have to act ‗judicially‘ and follow the rules of natural justice to the extent applicable but, they are not ‗Judges‘ of the ―Criminal Courts‖ trying an ‗accused‘ for commission of an offence, as understood in the general context. They perform quasi-judicial functions and do not act as ‗courts‘  but only as ‗administrators‘ and ‗adjudicators‘. In the proceedings before them, they do not try ‗an accused‘ for commission of ―any crime‖ (not merely an offence) but determine the liability of the contravenor for the breach of his ‗obligations‘ imposed under the Act. They impose ‗penalty‘ for the breach of the ―civil obligations‖ laid down under the Act and not impose any ‗sentence‘ for the commission of an offence. The expression ‗penalty‘ is a word of wide significance. Sometimes, it means recovery of an amount as a penal measure even in civil proceedings. An exaction which is not compensatory in character is also termed as a ‗penalty‘. When penalty is imposed by an adjudicating officer, it is done so in ―adjudicatory proceedings‖ and not by way of fine as a result of ‗prosecution‘ of an ‗accused‘ for commission of an ‗offence‘ in a criminal court. Therefore, merely because ‗penalty‘ clause exists in Section 23(1)(a), the nature of the proceedings under that section is not changed from ‗adjudicatory‘ to ‗criminal‘ prosecution. An order made by an adjudicating authority under the Act is not that of conviction but of determination of the breach of the civil obligation by the offender.  20 (1996) 2 SCC 471",

Therefore, unlike in a criminal case, where it is essential for the ‗prosecution‘ to establish that the ‗accused‘ had the necessary guilty intention or in other words the requisite ―mens rea‖ to commit the alleged offence with which he is charged before recording his conviction, the obligation on the part of the Directorate of Enforcement, in cases of contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of FERA, would be discharged where it is shown that the ―blameworthy conduct‖ of the delinquent had been established by wilful contravention by him of the provisions of Section 10, FERA, 1947. It is the delinquency of the defaulter itself which establishes his ‗blameworthy‘ conduct, attracting the provisions of Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 without any further proof of the existence of ―mens rea‖. Even after an adjudication by the authorities and levy of penalty under Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947, the defaulter can still be tried and punished for the commission of an offence under the penal law, where the act of the defaulter also amounts to an offence under the penal law and the bar under Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India in such a case would not be attracted. The failure to pay the penalty by itself attracts ‗prosecution‘ under Section 23-F and on conviction by the ‗court‘ for the said offence imprisonment may follow.",

The High Court apparently fell in error in treating the ―blameworthy conduct‖ under the Act as equivalent to the commission of a ―criminal offence‖, overlooking the position that the ―blameworthy conduct‖ in the adjudicatory proceedings is established by proof only of the breach of a civil obligation under the Act, for which the defaulter is obliged to make amends by payment of the penalty imposed under Section 23(1)(a) of the Act irrespective of the fact whether he committed the breach with or without any guilty intention.

This according to Mr. Singh is evident from the usage of the terms ―ceiling price‖ and Wholesale Price Index [WPI] in that Agenda.

Mr. Singh submitted that while the aforesaid Rules specifically incorporate and adopt the principles of rounding off, no provision under the 2013 DPCO empowers a manufacturer of formulations to follow the same route.

It was submitted that while resolving as such, the NPPA had placed a further rider that the aforesaid decision would only apply to those cases where there was no other mala fide intent on the part of a manufacturer.

(iv)  The methodology of fixing a ceiling price of NLEM medicines, by adopting the Simple Average Price of all the brands having market share (on the basis of Moving Annual Turnover) more than and equal to 1% of  the total market turnover of that medicine, will be as per the formula below:  24 NPP 2012  (Sum of prices of all the brands of the medicine having market share more than and equal to 1% of the total market turnover of that medicine) / (Total number of manufacturers producing such brands of the medicine)  (v)  The formulations will be priced only by fixing a Ceiling Price (CP). Manufacturers would be free to fix any price for their products equal to or below the CP. The CP‘s would be fixed on the dosage basis, such as per tablet / capsule / standard injection volume as listed in NLEM-2011.  (vi)  The Ceiling Price will be fixed on the basis of readily monitorable Market Based Data (MBD). To begin with, the basis for this readily monitorable market data would be the data available with the pharmaceuticals market data specializing company – IMS Health (IMS). Wherever required this data would be checked by appropriate survey/ evaluation by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). As the IMS data gives price figures for stockist level prices hence in order to arrive at ceiling Price (which will be the maximum retail price), the IMS price will be further increased by 16% as margin to the retailer so as to arrive at a reasonable ceiling price chargeable from the consumers.  (vii)  For drugs not in the IMS data, NPPA would collect data by commissioning the same.  (viii)  For the medicines where there is no reduction of price due to absence of competition, the overall percentage reduction in the price of same molecule with other dosage and strength will be applied; otherwise the overall percentage reduction in the price of medicines in the same therapeutic category will be applied.  (ix)  The CP for a drug listed in the NLEM would be the Simple Average of Prices as calculated on the basis of IMS data six months prior to the date of announcement of the new National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy i.e the ―Appointed Date‖ for bringing the new Policy into effect. For a drug whose data is not available in IMS, the NPPA will commission the data within a reasonable time for determining the Simple Average Prices also on the basis of prices prevailing six months prior to the Appointed Date. Thus the Simple Average Prices data date for the drugs available in IMS data and collected by NPPA would be same. Once the Simple Average Price is fixed, NPPA would monitor its implementation on a continuous basis through a proper methodology and system.  (x)  The prices of these NLEM-2011 medicines will be allowed an annual increase as per the Wholesale Price Index as notified by the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion. It is proposed to fix the 1st April of every year as the reference date for this. Accordingly, on 1st April of every year, companies will be automatically authorized to revise their prices upto the limit of the increase in the Wholesale Price Index for the  previous year. In case of decline in Wholesale Price Index, a corresponding reduction in the ceiling price will be obligatory. The NPPA itself will also separately notify the revised ceiling prices as applicable as on the 1st of April each year, and in case any company has fixed the prices not consistent with the revised ceiling prices, the NPPA will take appropriate action to have these revised.  (xi)  The Simple Average Price of all the brands of the medicine having market share (on the basis of Moving Annual Turnover) more than and equal to 1% of the total market turnover of that medicine -the Reference Prices for calculation of Simple Average Price -may also change on an annual basis due to changes in the MAT value. However, there would be no annual revision of Ceiling Prices on the basis of MAT. Revision of Ceiling Prices on the basis of MAT value would be carried out only once in five years or as and when NLEM is updated/revised. However, the Government will revise the ceiling price of a medicine under NLEM, if there is a significant change in the market structure of the particular medicine even in between 5 years.  (xii)  Non-price Control Drugs: Under the existing price control regime, the prices of Non-Scheduled drugs are monitored, and in case the prices of such drugs increase by more than 10% in a year, subject to certain criteria, government fixes the prices of such medicines from time to time. In the proposed policy, all essential drugs are under price control. It would follow that non-essential drugs should not be under a controlled regime and their prices should be fixed by market forces. However, in order to keep a check on overall drug prices, it is proposed that prices of such drugs be monitored on regular basis, and where such price increase at a rate of above 10% per annum is observed, the Government would be empowered to have the price of these drugs reduced to below this limit, for next twelve months.………….‖",

Bulk drugs were defined to mean those which were specified in the Second Schedule to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. A formulation was defined in Para 2(h) to mean a medicine processed out of or containing without the use of any one or more bulk drug or drugs with all pharmaceutical aids for internal or external use for diagnosis, treatment or  mitigation of disease in human beings. Scheduled bulk drugs were catalogued and specified in the First Schedule to the 1995 DPCO. A nonscheduled bulk drug was defined in Para 2(o) to mean a bulk drug not specified in the First Schedule. The 1995 DPCO defined a scheduled formulation to mean a formulation containing any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule either individually or in combination with other drugs. Similarly, a non-scheduled formulation was defined to mean a formulation not containing any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule. The provision contained in the 1995 DPCO empowered the Union to fix the maximum sale price of bulk drugs and scheduled formulations as well as to specify a ceiling price of scheduled formulations. The principles for calculation of the retail price of a formulation was set out in Para 7. The formula which came to be adopted and which embodied the cost-plus principle which was then prevalent required the authority to take into consideration material costs, conversion costs, packaging costs as well as the maximum ―Aflowable Post Manufacturing Expenses‖. Excise duty was also factored in for the purposes of arriving at the retail price. The power to revise the price of bulk drug and scheduled formulations was spelt out in Para 10 which read as under: - ―10. Power to revise price of bulk drugs and formulations :  Notwithstanding anything contained in this order :  (a)  the Government may, after obtaining such information as may be considered necessary from a manufacturer or importer, fix or revise the retail price of one or more formulations marketed by such manufacturer or importer, including a non-Scheduled formulation, in such manner as the pre-tax return on the sales turnover of such manufacturer or importer does not exceed the maximum pre-tax return specified in the Third Schedule;  (b)  the Government may, if it considers necessary so to do in public interest, after calling for such information by order fix or revise the  retail price of any formulation including a non-Scheduled formulation;  (c)  the Government may, if it considers necessary so to do in public interest, by order include any bulk drug in the First Schedule and fix or revise the prices of such a bulk drug and formulations containing such a bulk drug in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3, 7, 8 and 9, as the case may be.‖",

By a subsequent notification dated 30 May 2013, the Union Government delegated its powers comprised in Para 4 to 30 and 32 of the 2013 DPCO to the NPPA. The 2013 DPCO came to be promulgated in order to implement and enforce the policy decisions which were taken by the Union and stood embodied in the NPPP 2012. The 2013 DPCO did away with the concept of bulk drugs and essentially categorized drugs into scheduled and nonscheduled formulations. A scheduled formulation was defined in Para 2 (zb) to mean one which stood included in the First Schedule referred to either by its generic description or brand name. Non-scheduled formulations were defined to mean those which were not included in Schedule One. The expression „ceiling prices‟ was defined in Para 2(d) to mean a price fixed by the Government for scheduled formulations in  accordance with the provisions of the said order. Paras 5 and 6 which spelt out the principles for calculation of the retail price of a new drug and ceiling prices of scheduled formulations stand framed as under: - ―5. Calculation of retail price of a new drug for existing manufacturers of scheduled formulations.– (1) The retail price of the new drug available in domestic market shall be calculated as provided in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 4.  (2)  (i) the price to retailer of a new drug, not available in domestic market, shall be fixed by the Government on the principles of ―Pharmacoeconomics‖ of the new drug, on the recommendation of a Standing Committee of Experts formed under paragraph 15.

The consequences of an infraction of the aforesaid stipulation contained in Para 20 are prescribed to be the obligation of the manufacturer to not only deposit the overcharged amount but to also reduce the price of the drug in question to that which  was prevailing immediately before the event of overcharging and was compliant with Para 20. The manufacturer is further obliged to maintain the price of the drug at that level for the next twelve months. The provisions of Para 20 directly fell for consideration before this Court in Terumo Penpol which too was a case dealing with the issue of overcharging. The order of the NPPA which was impugned therein was assailed firstly on the ground with the petitioners there contending that since they had not increased the MRP of their drugs for the last several years, they were entitled to raise the price cumulatively taking into account the annual increase of 10% which had not been availed of earlier. The second challenge to the order passed by NPPA was based on the assertion that since the actual sale price of the drug was below the MRP for the year 2015, no penal consequences would ensue. In Terumo Penpol, the petitioner also sought to assail the action of the NPPA on the ground of inordinate delay in the raising of the demand alleging overcharging. While this Court while dealing with the present batch is not directly concerned with the latter two submissions which were addressed in that matter, it would be apposite to notice what the learned Judge ultimately held with respect to the scope of Para 20. The leaned Judge observed that in terms of Para 20 a manufacturer stands restrained from raising the MRP beyond 10% of the price as existing during the preceding twelve months. It was further pertinently observed that it would not be permissible for a manufacturer to make any adjustments on account of the MRP having not been raised in the preceding periods. The spirit behind Para 20 and the periodical increase which is permissible to be availed of by the manufacturer was further expressed by the Court to be aimed at ensuring  that there is no run away increase in the price of drugs.",

The only restriction placed by virtue of Paragraph 20 of the DPCO is that a manufacturer cannot increase the MRP of any drug by more than 10% of the MRP as prevailing during the preceding twelve months.

As per the illustration relied upon by Bard and extracted in paragraph 20 of this decision, it has sought to explain how Para 20 must be interpreted and implemented by asserting that a manufacturer would be entitled to claim a 10% revision in the MRP every twelve months. It also explained a case of overcharging by taking the example of a drug coming to be priced at Rs. 125/-where the allowed MRP in terms of Para 20 would be only Rs. 110/-. In that scenario it is conceded that the overcharged amount would be Rs. 15/-. However, for the next year, the position is explained with the allowed MRP being fixed at Rs. 121/-and thus factoring in the 10% increase which is otherwise permissible under Para 20. The case of Bard essentially is that notwithstanding a manufacturer having transgressed the limits prescribed in Para 20 in a particular year, that would not detract from its right to claim an increase in the MRP. The submission additionally was that the amount of overcharge cannot be computed without factoring in the periodic and annual 10% increase which the manufacturer can claim.",

The case of Bharat Serums stands on a slightly distinct footing since, and as was noticed hereinabove, it has been found to have violated Para 20 on account of having rounded off the permissible MRP under the 2013 DPCO. While explaining the impact of Para 20 in respect of the drug Histoglob, Bharat Serums has firstly contended that mere rounding off cannot be construed as overcharging. It has been argued that if the permissible price  of Histoglob be Rs. 90.75/-in February 2015, it was clearly permissible for the petitioner to round it off to Rs. 91/-. It similarly explains the aforesaid position while taking the permissible MRP in February 2016 to be Rs. 99.825/-. It was contended that if the aforesaid price were rounded off to Rs. 100/-, it could not be said that it had violated Para 20. It has additionally taken an objection to the freezing of the price at Rs. 90.75/which was the MRP prevailing in February 2015. It was urged that even if the infraction had firstly occurred in February 2015, its obligation to hold the price of the drug at that price could have only been for the next twelve months when computed from February 2015. It is urged that from February 2017, Bharat Serums must be recognized to be entitled to charge Rs. 109.808/-rounded off Rs. 110/-and that it cannot be compelled to charge only Rs. 90.75/-. It was argued that the directive issued by the respondents which essentially compels the manufacturer to roll back the price of the drug to the permissible MRP from the period of infraction and till the issuance of the impugned demand or act of rectification by the manufacturer is clearly contrary to Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO.",

The respondents further contend that if the default is ultimately cured after six years, the manufacturer would have to go back to the price which was prevailing in the first year and thereafter continue to hold the same for the entire period of six years. According to them and as is explained by Mr. Singh with the aid of the illustration noticed above, if the default had occurred in 2015 being Year One and is ultimately cured after six years, the manufacturer would have to maintain the price of the drug at the permissible price which was prevalent prior to Year One and hold it at that level throughout the period of the succeeding six years and twelve months even thereafter.

Under the 1995 DPCO, a ―scheduled formulation‖ was defined to mean a formulation  containing any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule either individually or as a combination. A non-scheduled formulation was defined to mean one which did not contain any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule. However, the power to fix the retail price of both the aforenoted categories of drugs stood embodied in Para 7. Insofar as scheduled formulations were concerned, while the computation of the retail price was to abide by the formulae set out in Para 7, the 1995 DPCO dealt with this category of formulations in Para 8 in order to amplify the procedure that it was bound to follow while fixing the retail price of scheduled formulations from time to time. Para 9 then conferred a power on the Government to fix a ceiling price of scheduled formulations. This too was to be guided by the provisions contained in Para 7. The power to revise the retail price of formulations including non-scheduled formulations was recognised and provisioned for in Para 10.",

The second significant policy change which was ushered in with the advent of the 2013 DPCO was of the NPPA retaining the power to fix prices in respect of scheduled formulations only. Insofar as nonscheduled formulations were concerned, all that was proclaimed was that it would “monitor” the price of such formulations. This appears to be a result of the variation in the total number of drugs which remained under price control starting from the 1979 DPCO [347 drugs], which was then abridged to 166 in 1987 and brought further down to 142. Under the 1995 DPCO, only 76 drugs were subjected to price control. This course of abridging the  total number of drugs which would be under price control was again reviewed in terms of the NPPP 2012 which essentially took the position that all essential drugs would be under price control and as a logical corollary non-essential drugs were to be kept out of the price control regime and their prices being left to be governed by market forces. In order however to keep a check on overall drug prices, non-essential drugs were to be monitored and the restrictive price band of 10% was mooted. These proposals and policy directives which formed the backbone of the NPPP 2012, inform the provisions of Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO.",

The aforesaid position which is taken in Bard, is reiterated in Bharat Serum with the respondents noting that it would be ineligible to seek the benefit of the sequential increase of 10% over the prevailing retail price till the price is reduced to fall within the permissible band in terms of Para 20 and held at that level for the next twelve months. Bard while assailing the aforesaid reasoning has contended that the view taken by the respondents has resulted in the freezing of its prices since 2018. They further contend that as a result of the impugned order, they had to bring down the prices of their medical devices to the levels prevailing in 2014-2015, maintain it for the next twelve months and then commence afresh. The aforesaid grievance is liable to be considered in the backdrop of the demand notice for the period 2015-16 having been issued only in 2019.

Secondly, the manufacturer would have to be held to be obliged in law to freeze or roll back the retail price of the drug to the level which was prevailing prior to the alleged infraction not just from that crucial point in time but to hold it at that level for the entire period commencing from the date of overcharging upto the date of issuance of the demand. Additionally, the manufacturer would have to hold that retail price for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of the demand and the revision permitted thereafter would have to be a 10% increase over the permissible price which prevailed prior to the date of overcharging.

The 10% factor attached to the right of sequential increase in the first part of Para 20 is the solitary fetter placed on the manufacturer who is otherwise left free to fix the price of its formulation. Para 20 significantly does not postulate that a transgression of that particular stipulation would result in the manufacturer being deprived of the right to claim an annual revision of the MRP. All that it prescribes is that in case of a violation it must revise the MRP, roll it back to the valid price prevailing in the preceding twelve months and hold it at that level for the next twelve months. It is for the next twelve months alone that the price must remain static as per the statutory command enshrined in Para 20.

The word ―next‖ denotes and prescribes the period during which the MRP of the formulation must be kept static after being rolled back. For the purposes of identifying the valid MRP against which a periodic 10% increase may be claimed, it is the price prevailing in the preceding year which would govern and decide. Similarly, the period during which the MRP must be revised and kept on hold is also prescribed to be the next twelve months when computed with reference to the date or period of the infraction.

Para  13 of the 1995 DPCO which has been extracted hereinabove, made provisions for recovery of overcharged amounts. While dealing with that subject, Para 13 prescribed that the Government shall by notice require manufacturers, importers or distributors to deposit the amount accrued due to charging of prices higher than those fixed or notified by the Government under the provisions of the 1987 and 1995 DPCOs‘. Para 13 thus prescribed and put in place a procedure in terms of which the Government was to place manufacturers, importers or distributors on notice to deposit the amounts which may have accrued due to charging of prices higher than those fixed under the Price Control Orders. However, Para 20 has been worded in a manner which is starkly distinct from Para 13. It becomes pertinent to note that Para 20(1) clearly appears to put in place a self regulatory mechanism which obligates the manufacturer to ensure that the price that it fixes for non-scheduled formulations does not exceed 10% of the price prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The penalty which would visit a manufacturer in case of a violation of the aforesaid provision is clearly and unambiguously spelt out in that provision itself when it stipulates that in case a manufacturer breaches the maximum permissible increase of 10%, it would be under an obligation to deposit the amount overcharged in excess together with interest. Significantly, the compliance with the aforesaid prescriptions is not made dependent upon or subject to an order being made by the NPPA. What places Para 20 in a position distinct from Para 13 of the 1995 DPCO is that unlike the latter which envisages interest being leviable from the date when a manufacturer fails to comply with a demand, the former is not premised on a demand being raised at all. Under Para 20, the manufacturer becomes liable to take steps for reparation the moment an  event of overcharging occurs. The trigger event under Para 20 is thus the act of overcharging itself.",

Regard must be had to the fact that since and insofar as non-scheduled formulations are concerned, the Government has only retained the power to monitor prices of such formulations, the 2013 DPCO casts a duty upon that class of manufacturers to ensure that the price of their drugs do not breach the maximum permissible increase which is prescribed.

Bharat Serums has in terms of the data placed on the record clearly established that it has been held to have overcharged  merely because it had rounded off the price of its drugs. This is evident from the disclosures made by the said petitioner where the price of Rs. 90.75 was rounded off to Rs. 91 and Rs. 109.808 was rounded off to Rs. 110.

The respondents have failed to point out any justifiable or rationale basis on account of which the principle of rounding off would not apply to nonscheduled formulations. The Court finds no justification in the stand taken by the respondents who contend that while it would be open for a manufacturer of a scheduled formulation to round off the price of its products, that benefit should be denied to manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations. Once the NPPA had arrived at the conclusion that rounding off was a well-accepted mathematical principle, the Court finds no justification to discriminate between scheduled and non-scheduled formulations and restrict the application of that practice only to the former. The Court deems it pertinent to observe that if the argument as advanced on behalf of the respondents on this score were to be countenanced, it would not only amount to a hostile discrimination between scheduled and nonscheduled formulations, it would additionally and more fundamentally be patently arbitrary. The Court comes to this firm conclusion since the respondents have abjectly failed to indicate any valid or justifiable ground on the basis of which the principle of rounding off which as per the respondents themselves is a well recognised mathematical practice would not apply to non-scheduled formulations. The Court also bears in mind the fact that the applicability of the aforesaid mathematical practice has been accorded due recognition and acceptance by the NPPA itself. That decision taken by the apex regulatory body cannot and should not be construed as being restricted to scheduled formulations alone.

                        "content": "Having traversed the issues which were raised in this batch, the Court comes to record the following conclusions: - A.  The 2013 DPCO represents a conscious decision taken by the Union to leave the price of non-scheduled formulations to be determined by market forces subject to the rider that the annual increase would not exceed 10% and in case of overcharging the manufacturer would have to roll back the prices to the preceding legally permissible price and preserve it at that level for the next twelve months.  B.  Viewed in that backdrop it is evident that a manufacturer of a nonscheduled formulation was entitled to fix the price of its drug subject to the singular fetter of the same being compliant with the stipulation of 10% which was sanctioned.  C.  Undisputedly, non-scheduled formulations are not subject to the rigors of price control under the 2013 DPCO. That provision simply places an obligation upon the Government to monitor and oversee that the maximum retail price of such formulations does not exceed 10% of the price which was prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The salutary objective underlying this prescription is clearly manifest bearing in mind the fact that drug prices must necessarily be regulated by the Government in order to ensure that patients and consumers do not face the specter of runaway price increases and to control profiteering.  D.  However, Para 20 undoubtedly permits a manufacturer to increase the maximum retail price annually subject to the singular limitation that the price increase would not exceed 10% of the price which was prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The consequences of a breach of the aforesaid prescription is also not left open to speculation with Para 20 in clear and unequivocal terms prescribing the penalty as well as the remedial measures which must be adopted.  E.  Significantly, Para 20 does not envisage a deprivation of the right to increase the retail price of a drug annually in case of overcharging. Para 20 spells out and stipulates both the consequences as well as the penalties which would visit a manufacturer in case it were to violate its provisions. The stand taken by the respondents to the effect that the right to seek such increase would stand lost till such time as the price is revised and brought down, would not only amount to a recasting of Para 20, it would also and on more fundamental terms, result in the introduction of a penal consequence which neither flows from a plain reading of that provision nor can be inferred.  F.  The crucial expressions which would throw light on the intent of Para 20 are the expressions “preceding” and “next”. The word ―preceding‖ acts as a pointer to the date or the period which would constitute the focal point to identify the legally permissible MRP with reference to which an infraction is liable to be examined. The word ―next‖ denotes and prescribes the period during which the  MRP of the formulation must be kept static after being rolled back. For the purposes of identifying the valid MRP against which a periodic 10% increase may be claimed, it is the price prevailing in the preceding year which would govern and decide.  G.  Similarly, the period during which the MRP must be revised and kept on hold is also prescribed to be the next twelve months when computed with reference to the date or period of the infraction. Both the commencement as well as the termination of the period during which the MRP must remain frozen has to be necessarily computed with reference to the date or the period during which the manufacturer may have overcharged.  H.  While the Court is conscious of the fact that the issues involved here relate to drugs and the paramount consideration of the said essential commodity being sold and distributed in a fair and equitable manner, it finds itself unable to introduce in or read into Para 20 a penal consequence which has otherwise not been incorporated by the authors of the statute. It is not for this Court to structure or insert a penal consequence on its own understanding or notions of righteousness.  I.  Para 20 therefore must be read as providing a right to manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations to price their products subject to the rider that the increase complies with the 10% stipulation. That right of the manufacturer would be entitled to be factored in notwithstanding it having transgressed the latter part of Para 20 and overcharged.  J.  The increase of 10% shall stand effaced only for the period of twelve months post the transgression of Para 20 where a manufacturer may have overcharged and violated that provision.  K.  In case of a violation of Para 20 and an overcharging event having occurred, the manufacturer would be liable to roll back the price of the drug to the level at which it stood prior to the transgression and hold that price for twelve months post the date or the period of overcharge.  L.  For the purposes of computing the liability that would stand raised in the case of an overcharging, the NPPA would be obliged to identity the date or the period during which the price of the drug transgressed Para 20 and require the manufacturer to revert to the price which prevailed prior to that event for a period of twelve months.  M.  However the liability to roll back the price of the drug and keep it static at that level cannot extend beyond the twelve month period prescribed under Para 20 and continue up to the raising of a demand or till such time as the transgression is cured. The manufacturer in any case cannot be held liable to keep the price frozen for the period between the date or period of infraction till the date of raising of a demand or till the infraction is rectified by the manufacturer itself.  N.  While calculating the liability relating to overcharge, the NPPA would have to take into consideration the legally permissible price which must be enforced over the next twelve months commencing  from the date or period of infraction, even if that may entail a notional computational exercise being undertaken.  O.  In a case where the infraction is discovered many years down the line, in order to arrive at the actual liability owed, the authority would have to reverse the clock and calculate backwards in order to ascertain the legally permissible MRP which is to be enforced and the period of twelve months during which that price must be preserved.  P.  However, for successive periods post the “next twelve months”, the manufacturer would be entitled to claim the 10% increase which is otherwise sanctioned by virtue of the first part of Para 20. The computation of liability would have to necessarily factor that into consideration while notionally computing the ultimate overcharge amount.  Q.  Para 20 has been worded in a manner which is starkly distinct from Para 13. Para 20(1) clearly appears to put in place a self-regulatory mechanism which obligates the manufacturer to ensure that the price that it fixes for non-scheduled formulations does not exceed 10% of the price prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The penalty which would visit a manufacturer in case of a violation of the aforesaid provision is clearly and unambiguously spelt out in that provision itself when it stipulates that in case a manufacturer breaches the maximum permissible increase of 10%, it would be under an obligation to deposit the amount overcharged in excess together with interest.  R.  Significantly, the compliance with the aforesaid prescriptions is not made dependent upon or subject to an order being made by the NPPA. What places Para 20 in a position distinct from Para 13 of the 1995 DPCO is that unlike the latter which envisages interest being leviable from the date when a manufacturer fails to comply with a demand, the former is not premised on a demand being raised at all. Under Para 20, the manufacturer becomes liable to take steps for reparation the moment an event of overcharging occurs. The trigger event under Para 20 is thus the act of overcharging itself.  S.  Sub Para (2) in clear and unequivocal terms mandates that interest shall be payable on the overcharged amount from the date of increase in price. The expression ―date of increase in price‖ must necessarily be understood to be a categorical reference to the date or the period from which interest is ordained to be leviable. Para 20(2) thus appears to leave no room for doubt that interest has to be paid from the date of increase of such price.  T.  Para 20 neither contemplates the issuance of a notice nor does it adopt the principle of amount ―accrued‖ as was envisaged under the 1995 DPCO. T.C. Healthcare and all judgments which followed thereafter were essentially construing the provisions of Para 13 of the 1995 DPCO. However, the trigger point in terms of Para 20 is not a notice or a demand but the event of overcharging itself. Secondly, sub para (2) in unequivocal terms prescribes that the interest shall be leviable from the date of increase of price. The  language of Para 20(2) thus leaves no room to introduce the concept of a notice of demand being the precursor to the liability to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest.  U.  The liability to pay amounts which are due together with interest is related to any sums that may be recoverable in pursuance of any order made under Section 3 of the Act. The 2013 DPCO, and of which Para 20 is an integral part, is itself an order made under Section 3 of that Act. Thus, the liability to pay interest from the date of increase of price which stands created in light of Para 20 is itself liable to be recognised as one created in terms of an order made under Section 3 itself. The Court thus finds itself unable to interpret Section 7A(1)(a) as stultifying the command of Para 20.  V.  Bard did not dispute that medical devices did fall within the definition of ―drug‖ and would thus fall within the ambit of nonscheduled formulations under Para 20. Consequently, merely because the respondent did not call upon these manufacturers to submit a price list in a particular format, would not absolve Bard from their obligation to ensure compliance with Para 20. Bard in any case cannot assert that it was unaware of the legal obligation to be compliant with Para 20. The reporting mechanism which was developed by NPPA in 2017 was only to aid them in the task of monitoring the price of non-scheduled formulations.  W.  The Court has borne in mind that insofar as non-scheduled formulations are concerned, the NPPA only exercises the power to monitor their prices. Having freed this category of manufacturers  from the rigors of price control, there appears to be no justification to restrict the applicability of the rounding off principle to scheduled formulations only.  X.  The Court finds no justification in the stand taken by the respondents who contend that while it would be open for a manufacturer of a scheduled formulation to round off the price of its products, that benefit should be denied to manufacturers of nonscheduled formulations. Once the NPPA had arrived at the conclusion that rounding off was a well-accepted mathematical principle, the Court finds no justification to discriminate between scheduled and non-scheduled formulations.  Y.  Depriving manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations of the facility of rounding off which is otherwise and generally accepted by the NPPA itself as a well-recognized mathematical practice would be manifestly arbitrary. The respondents have failed to point out any justifiable or rationale basis on account of which the principle of rounding off would not apply to non-scheduled formulations.",
