In the present case, as the name itself has no connection with the goods in question, it is capable of distinguishing the goods of the plaintiff from the defendant no. 1 and, therefore, is entitled to protection as a trade mark.

In this regard, he places reliance on the judgment of this Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar &  Co., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50.

In The Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd., (1955) 2 SCR 252, the Supreme Court held that where a distinctive label is registered as a whole, such registration cannot possibly give any exclusive statutory right to the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular word or name contained therein apart from the mark as a whole. The proprietor of the mark cannot expand the area of protection granted to the mark. The Division Bench of this Court in Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Ltd. v. Parul Food Specialities Pvt. Ltd., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 288, reiterated that the distinctiveness to which the registered proprietor of a mark can lay a claim is to what it has gotten registered as a whole and such registration cannot possibly give an exclusive statutory right to such proprietor qua a particular word of common origin.",

The area of operation of the plaintiff and the defendant no.1 is also distinct; with the plaintiff being in Delhi, while the defendant no.1 being predominantly in the State of Gujarat. The defendant no.1 also has developed suitable goodwill of the mark in its favour, as is evident from its claim of having a gross sale of Rs. 13.30 Crore approximately between the period of December, 2020 to April 2022.
