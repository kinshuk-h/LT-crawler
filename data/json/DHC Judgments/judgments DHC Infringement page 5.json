                        "content": "The relevant facts leading to the filing of the instant Writ Petition are as follows: - i.  On 19.05.1992 the Directorate General of Resettlement (“DGR” or “Respondent No. 5”) which functions under the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (Ministry of Defence) issued guidelines titled “Guidelines for Sponsoring & Creating of Security Agencies & Related Activities” which laid down general norms for sponsoring security agencies for award of security contracts and the modus operandi of their functioning.  ii.  Thereafter, the Ministry of Defence issued an Office Memorandum dated 04.02.1994 addressed to the Secretaries of all Ministries and Departments of Government of India, stating that Respondent No. 5 has evolved a scheme to maintain a panel of retired Service officers, State Ex-Servicemen Corporation and Ex-Servicemen Cooperative Societies who are desirous of obtaining security work on contract basis.  iii.  Subsequently, on 11.11.1994, Respondent No. 1 issued an Office Memorandum requesting all administrative Ministries/Departments of the Government of India to issue instructions to public sector undertakings under their administrative control to obtain contract security services from Respondent No. 5 or the State Ex-Servicemen Security Corporation for sponsoring Ex-Servicemen Security Agencies on their panel without engaging security agencies on contract through open tender. Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 on 18.03.1996 issued another O.M. reiterating the request made in the earlier O.M. dated 11.11.1994.  iv.  On 10.12.1997, Respondent No.1, while noting the need for granting greater operational freedom to the public sector enterprises and a view to rationalise and simplify the existing set of guidelines to public sector enterprises, issued an O.M. cancelling the previous O.M.’s dated 11.11.1994 and 18.03.1996 amongst other guidelines/memoranda.  v.  Thereafter on 01.02.1999, Respondent No. 1 issues an O.M. restoring the earlier cancelled Office Memoranda dated 11.11.1994 and 18.03.1996, modifying them to the extent that the Respondent No. 5 would sponsor more than one security agency so that Central Public Sector Enterprises (“CPSEs”) concerned would have a choice in choosing a suitable outfit keeping in view their specific requirements and the service chargeable by the security agencies will be negotiable. Subsequently, Respondent No. 1 issued O.M.’s dated 27.01.2003, 11.02.2005 and 04.10.2005 reiterating its request made in the restored O.M.’s.  vi.  Thereafter on 11.02.2005, Respondent No. 1 issued an O.M. making Respondent No. 5, the nodal authority to sponsor security agencies including State Ex-Servicemen Security Corporations to all Public Sector Undertakings.  vii.  On 23.06.2005, PSARA came into force, which is a legislation enacted with the objective of regulating private security agencies (“PSAs”).  viii.  The Respondent No. 4, on 30.04.2016, awarded to the Petitioner No. 1 a composite contract for Pipeline RoU surveillance including Foot Patrolling and Watch and Ward Services for various installations under NCR Gas O&M for a period of three years expiring on 30.04.2019. The selection of Petitioner No. 1 for the composite contract was done through an open tender process involving competitive bidding.  ix.  Thereafter, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, Government of India published the General Financial Rules, 2017 on 11.02.2017 and a Manual for Procurement of Consultancy and Other Services, 2017 on 18.04.2017 which dealt with selection methods for engagement of service providers.  x.  On 13.09.2018, Respondent No. 1 issued Impugned O.M., directing all administrative Ministries/Departments to issue instructions to the CPSEs under their administrative control requiring manpower of security services to obtain a panel of qualified Ex-Servicemen Security Service Providers only from Respondent No. 5, without resorting to the open tender process. The relevant portion of the Impugned O.M. reads as follows:  “2. It is proposed to merge the provisions of the main guidelines of 1994 and its amendments issued from time to time into one comprehensive guideline as follows:  (i)  In order to prevent exploitation of Ex-servicemen (ESM) and to effectively implement their rehabilitation process, the Directorate General of Resettlement (DGR) has evolved a scheme whereby retired service officers and State Ex-servicemen Security Corporations desirous of obtaining contracts from CPSEs to provide manpower for security are empaneled. In this system, DGR provides a panel of qualified Ex-servicemen Security Agencies and State ESM Security Corporations functioning under the directives of Ministry of Defence.  (ii)  All administrative Ministries / Departments are requested to issue necessary instructions to the CPSEs under their administrative control requiring manpower for security services, to obtain a panel of qualified Ex-Servicemen Security Service Providers only from the Directorate General of Resettlement (DGR). West Block – IV, R.K. Puram, New Delhi without going to open tendering process.  (iii)  However, to ensure that CPSEs get more cost effective and efficient security agencies, DGR will sponsor more than one security agency so that the CPSE concerned would have a choice in choosing a suitable outfit keeping in view their specific requirements.  (iv)  The service charges chargeable by security agency will be negotiable between the CPSE and the agency concerned subject to guidelines issued vide MoD OM No. 28(3)/2012-D (Res-1) dated 09.07.2012 and amendments made therein from time to time  (v)  Ministry of Defence, Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare is the nodal Ministry / Dept. for issuance of comprehensive guidelines on the subject matter.",

All administrative Ministries / Departments are requested to kindly issue necessary instruction to the CPSEs accordingly.” (emphasis supplied)  xi.  The Petitioner No. 1 sent a representation on 26.02.2019 to the Respondent No. 4 calling upon them to not give effect to the Impugned O.M. as process of selection from panel of names given by Respondent No. 5 instead of open tender process.  xii.  Thereafter on 07.03.2019, Respondent No. 4 issued a tender bearing E-Tender No. 8000014720 (“Impugned Tender I”), inviting bids from security agencies which are sponsored by Respondent No. 5.  xiii.  The Respondent No. 4 floated three other tenders, namely, Tender No. GAIL/NCR/C&P/S96/2K18/HARYANA (REGION-1) (“Impugned Tender II”), Tender No. GAIL/NCR/C&P/S97/2K18/ HARYANA (REGION-2) (“Impugned Tender III”), and Tender No. GAIL/NCR/C&P/S98/2K18-19/PUNJAB (“Impugned Tender IV”). Impugned Tender II has been issued for hiring of security, care taking and loss prevention services for natural gas pipeline and LPG Pipeline in the State of Haryana (Region 1). Impugned Tender III has been issued for hiring of security, care taking and loss prevention services for natural gas pipeline and LPG Pipeline in the State of Haryana (Region 2).Impugned Tender IV has been issued for hiring of security, care taking and loss prevention services for natural gas pipeline Chandigarh Zonal Offices in the State of Punjab.  xiv.  On 29.04.2019, the Respondent No. 4 issued a letter extending the duration of the contract awarded to Petitioner No. 1 till 29.08.2019.",

                        "content": "Further, it is submitted by the Ld. Senior Counsel for the Petitioners that the Impugned O.M. classifies all licensed PSAs into sub-classes, i.e. (i) security agencies empanelled with Respondent No. 5 and (ii) security agencies not empanelled with Respondent No. 5. The Petitioners contend that such a classification created by the Impugned O.M. is wholly arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable as it is not based on any real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable connection to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned O.M. and is thereby violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, 1950.He places reliance upon the judgment in Comptroller & Auditor-General v. Kamlesh Vadilal Mehta, (2003) 2 SCC  349, to support this argument. The relevant paragraphs of the judgment read as under:  “8. It is not disputed that the Chartered Accountants having qualification are eligible for being considered for entrustment of audit work for public sector undertakings or government concerns. Once it is accepted that these Chartered Accountants are qualified and eligible for the audit work and are also eligible for being brought on the panel of audit work for public sector undertakings and government concerns, there appears no valid reason why the impugned advertisement has created a sub-classification from the general class of eligible Chartered Accountants which relates to a smaller group of Chartered Accountants who form partnership concerns only.”",

Additionally, the Impugned O.M. and Impugned Tenders do not bear any reasonable nexus to advancing the commercial interests of the CPSEs either, as that can only be achieved through either the Least Cost Selection (“LCS”) method or through the Quality and Cost Based Selection (“QCBS”) method but not through Single Source Selection (“SSS”) method. Further, it is submitted that the Impugned O.M. and Impugned Tenders change the previous policy of open tendering to the present one without any justification and in an arbitrary manner, thereby violating Article 14 of the Constitution of India, 1950.",

The Court interpreted Article 14 of the Constitution and analysed the scope, meaning and effect of Article 14. It is in this case that the test of reasonable classification was first defined. The  relevant paragraph of the judgment reads as follows:  “55... It is now well established that while Article 14 is designed to prevent a person or class of persons from being singled out from others similarly situated for the purpose of being specially subjected to discriminating and hostile legislation, it does not insist on an “abstract symmetry” in the sense that every piece of legislation must have universal application. All persons are not, by nature, attainment or circumstances, equal and the varying needs of different classes of persons often require separate treatment and, therefore, the protecting clause has been construed as a guarantee against discrimination amongst equals only and not as taking away from the State the power to classify persons for the purpose of legislation. This classification may be on different bases. It may be geographical or according to objects or occupations or the like. Mere classification, however, is not enough to get over the inhibition of the Article. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and (2) that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between them. In short, while the Article forbids class legislation in the sense of making improper discrimination by conferring privileges or imposing liabilities upon persons arbitrarily selected out of a large number of other persons similarly situated in relation to the privileges  sought to be conferred or the liability proposed to be imposed, it does not forbid classification for the purpose of legislation, provided such classification is not arbitrary in the sense I have just explained. The doctrine, as expounded by this Court in the two cases I have mentioned, leaves a considerable latitude to the Court in the matter of the application of Article 14 and consequently has the merit of flexibility.”  (emphasis supplied)",

Tendolkar, 1959 SCR 279; C.I. Emden v. State of U.P., (1960) 2 SCR 592; Kangsari Haldar v. State of W.B., (1960) 2 SCR 646; Jyoti Pershad v. Administrator for Union Territory of Delhi, (1962) 2 SCR 125 and State of Gujarat v.

The Court in its decision discussed the mandate of Article 14, including the test of “classification” and reiterated that Article 14 permits reasonable classification. The following excerpt from the judgment is of relevance:  “183. The parameters laid down by this Court on the scope of applicability of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, in matters where the State, its instrumentalities, and their functionaries, are engaged in contractual  obligations (as they emerge from the judgments extracted in paras 159 to 182, above) are being briefly paraphrased. For an action to be able to withstand the test of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, it has already been expressed in the main opinion that it has to be fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent, non-capricious, unbiased, without favouritism or nepotism, in pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment. The judgments referred to, endorse all those requirements where the State, its instrumentalities, and their functionaries, are engaged in contractual transactions. Therefore, all “governmental policy” drawn with reference to contractual matters, it has been held, must conform to the aforesaid parameters. While Article 14 of the Constitution of India permits a reasonable classification having a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved, it does not permit the power of pick and choose arbitrarily out of several persons falling in the same category. Therefore, criteria or procedure have to be adopted so that the choice among those falling in the same category is based on reason, fair play and non-arbitrariness. Even if there are only two contenders falling in the zone of consideration, there should be a clear, transparent and objective criteria or procedure to indicate which out of the two is to be preferred. It is this, which would ensure transparency.” (emphasis supplied)",

This has been held to mean that even among likes, if a classification has been made on real and intelligible criteria, then they can be treated differently. The principles governing reasonable classification which have been stated hereinabove are thus also applicable to sub-classes which have been created within a class. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of State of W.B. v. Rash Behari Sarkar, (1993) 1 SCC 479 was dealing with a challenge to a notification issued under the Bengal Amusements Tax Act, 1922. The notification exempted from payment of entertainment tax, any performance by a bona fide group theatre, amateur theatre or amateur jatra, formed exclusively for purposes of cultural activities and not for monetary gains. This tax exemption was not given to theatre groups which performed for monetary gains. Even though both groups were theatre groups, the Hon’ble Court in this case held that this classification was reasonable, not arbitrary and thus not in violation of Article 14. The Court stated the following:  “4. Equality means equality in similar circumstances between same class of persons for same purpose and objective. It cannot operate amongst unequals. Only likes can be treated alike. But even amongst likes the legislature or executive may classify on distinction which are real. A classification amongst groups performing shows for monetary gains and cultural activities cannot be said to be arbitrary. May be that both the groups carry out the legislative objective of promoting social and educational activities and,  therefore, they are likes but the distinction between the two on monetary gains and otherwise is real and intelligible. So long the classification is reasonable it cannot be struck down as arbitrary. Likes can be treated differently for good and valid reasons. The State in treating the group performing theatrical shows for advancement of social and educational purpose, differently, on basis of profit-making from those formed exclusively for cultural activities cannot be said to have acted in violation of Article 14.”  (emphasis supplied)",

The case was concerning a challenge to an amendment to the Schedule of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1976 which enhanced the rate of quarterly tax in respect of inter-State carriage operators. The challenge was based on the ground that the reduction of tax liability in favour of the vehicles covered by intra-State contract carriage permit without granting the same to inter-State contract carriages amounted to a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The Court in this case noted that even though both inter-State and intra-State operators, were in a generic sense, State carriage operators, there was a reasonable distinction between the two. The Court in this regard held as follows:  “10. The validity of Section 22 of the Act has not been questioned which section empowers the State in public interest to grant exemptions in such a manner as it deems fit to a class of people. Once we hold that the contract carriages covered by intra-State permits and inter-State permits can form two distinct and separate classes within the larger class of contract carriages, we find it difficult to hold that this classification is either unreasonable or it lacks a nexus to the object or  is violative of Article 14. The opinion as to public interest contemplated under Section 22 of the Act will have to be formed by the State after taking into consideration the various factors which affect the public at large. Definitely, in the absence of a challenge to this decision-making process on facts, it will not be open to us to substitute our views in this matter to that of the opinion formed by the State. For the reasons stated above, with respect, we are unable to concur with the judgment of the Appellate Bench of the Kerala High Court which is impugned before us and the same is set aside.”  (emphasis supplied)",

It is clear that the law does not interdict the creation of a class within a class absolutely. Should there be a rational basis for creating a sub-class within a class, then, it is not impermissible.

Ex-Servicemen are also subject to extensive scrutiny vis-à-vis their conduct and antecedents while they are in service. Additionally, the Impugned O.M. furthers the cause of welfare of ex-servicemen by providing them an opportunity to provide security to CPSEs.

Firstly, the decision in Comptroller & Auditor-General (supra) does not state that there is an absolute bar on the creation of a sub-class under Article 14 of the Constitution. The sub-classification in that case was struck down on the basis that it was not made on a rational basis and was not reasonable. In that  case, the Auditors were “qualified and eligible” to be appointed as Auditors but were not appointed as they worked in a proprietary firm and not a partnership firm. Regardless of whether an auditor worked at a proprietary firm or a partnership firm, the training undergone remained the same between the two persons and thus a differentiation based on whether the auditor works at a proprietary or a partnership firm was held not to be reasonable. In the present case the Petitioners are not qualified and eligible for being appointed to provide security services to CPSEs as per the Impugned O.M. and the Impugned Tenders. In the present case, the level of training, standards of conduct and scrutiny of antecedents which persons who are ex-servicemen and persons who are not ex-servicemen undergo are starkly different and thus there is a reasonable distinction in their qualifications even though both work for licensed PSAs. As stated above, the distinction created by the Impugned O.M. between PSAs which employ ex-servicemen and PSA which do not employ ex-servicemen is based on intelligible differentia which has reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by it. Therefore, the Impugned O.M. and the Impugned Tenders create a reasonable classification which is not in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.",

It has been observed consistently by the Supreme Court in a number of judgments that the Court may interfere in an administrative decision, if and only if the same is arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, mala fide or biased. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Tata  Cellular v. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 651, has stated as follows:  “70. It cannot be denied that the principles of judicial review would apply to the exercise of contractual powers by Government bodies in order to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. However, it must be clearly stated that there are inherent limitations in exercise of that power of judicial review. Government is the guardian of the finances of the State. It is expected to protect the financial interest of the State. The right to refuse the lowest or any other tender is always available to the Government. But, the principles laid down in Article 14 of the Constitution have to be kept in view while accepting or refusing a tender. There can be no question of infringement of Article 14 if the Government tries to get the best person or the best quotation. The right to choose cannot be considered to be an arbitrary power. Of course, if the said power is exercised for any collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be struck down.”",

This Court being the guardian of fundamental rights is duty-bound to interfere when there is arbitrariness, irrationality, mala fides and bias. However, this Court in all the aforesaid decisions has cautioned time and again that courts should exercise a lot of restraint while exercising their powers of judicial review in contractual or commercial matters. This Court is normally loathe to interfere in contractual matters unless a clear-cut case of arbitrariness or mala fides or bias or irrationality is made out. One must remember that today many public sector undertakings compete with the private industry. The contracts entered into between private parties are not subject to scrutiny under writ jurisdiction. No doubt,  the bodies which are State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution are bound to act fairly and are amenable to the writ jurisdiction of superior courts but this discretionary power must be exercised with a great deal of restraint and caution. The courts must realise their limitations and the havoc which needless interference in commercial matters can cause. In contracts involving technical issues the courts should be even more reluctant because most of us in Judges' robes do not have the necessary expertise to adjudicate upon technical issues beyond our domain. As laid down in the judgments cited above the courts should not use a magnifying glass while scanning the tenders and make every small mistake appear like a big blunder. In fact, the courts must give “fair play in the joints” to the government and public sector undertakings in matters of contract. Courts must also not interfere where such interference will cause unnecessary loss to the public exchequer.”",

It is well settled in law that wherever a contract is to be awarded or a licence is sought to be given, it is obligatory on the part of the public authority to adopt a transparent and fair method. It serves two purposes, namely, participation of all eligible competitors and giving a fair opportunity to them and also generating maximum revenue. In this context, we may profitably refer to a two-Judge Bench in Nagar Nigam, Meerut v. Al Faheem Meat Exports (P) Ltd. [(2006) 13 SCC 382] , wherein it has been held as follows : (SCC p. 395, para 16)  “16. The law is well settled that contracts by the State, its corporations, instrumentalities and agencies must be normally granted through public auction/public tender by inviting tenders from eligible persons and the notification of the public auction or inviting tenders should be advertised in well-known dailies having wide circulation in the locality with all relevant details such as date, time and place of auction, subject-matter of auction, technical specifications, estimated cost, earnest money deposit, etc. The award of government contracts through public auction/public tender is to ensure transparency in the public procurement, to maximise economy and efficiency in government procurement, to promote healthy competition among the tenderers, to provide for fair and equitable treatment of all tenderers, and to eliminate irregularities, interference and corrupt practices by the authorities concerned. This is required by Article 14 of the Constitution.””",

The Impugned O.M. expressly states that in order to get cost effective and efficient security, Respondent No. 5 will sponsor more than one security agency so that the concerned CPSE has a choice in choosing a suitable PSA as per their specific requirements. Similarly, the Impugned Tenders issued invite bids from PSAs which are eligible as per the Bid Evaluation Criteria provided for in the Tender Notice. The Bid Evaluation Criteria in clear terms states that the bidding agency must be empanelled with/sponsored by Respondent No. 5 in order to be eligible to bid for the Impugned Tenders, and is in consonance with the Impugned O.M. The Impugned Tenders provide for a well-defined evaluation procedure on the basis of which Letter of Acceptance will be issued, thereby removing any scope of arbitrariness in the manner in which the Respondent exercises its choice.

Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Seth & Ors.: (1984) 4 SCC 27, the Supreme Court set aside the order of the High Court striking down the rule that provided that no re-evaluation of  answer-book or supplement would be done and no candidate shall claim or be entitled to claim re-evaluation of answer books. In that case, certain students had filed a writ petition praying that they may be allowed to inspect the answer-sheets and the appellant (Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education) be directed to re-evaluate the answer-sheets. They challenged the validity of the rules proscribing the same. The High Court partly allowed the petition. Resultantly, the examinees were entitled to seek a disclosure, inspection and re-evaluation of the answer-sheets. In the aforesaid background of the facts, the Supreme Court observed as under:  “20. We consider that the above approach made by the High Court is totally fallacious and is vitiated by its failure to follow the well-established doctrine of interpretation that the provisions contained in a statutory enactment or in rules/regulations framed thereunder have to be so construed as to be in harmony with each other and that where under a specific section or rule a particular subject has received special treatment, such special provision will exclude the applicability of any general provision which might otherwise cover the said topic…..Clause (1) of the said regulation states that any candidate who has appeared at the HSC examination may apply to Divisional Secretary for verification of marks, particularly in any subject, but such verification will be restricted to check whether all the answers have been examined and whether any mistake has been committed in totalling of marks in that subject or in transferring marks correctly on the first cover page of the answer book as well as whether the supplements attached to the answer books as mentioned by the candidates are intact. Clause (3) of the said regulation imposes the further limitation that no candidate shall claim or be entitled to revaluation of his answer book or  disclosure or inspection of the answer book or further documents as these are to be treated by the Divisional Boards as most confidential. It is obvious that clauses (1) and (3) have to be read together and not in isolation from each other as has apparently been done by the High Court. The right of verification conferred by clause (1) is subject to the limitation contained in the same clause that no revaluation of the answer books or supplements shall be done and the further restriction imposed by clause (3), prohibiting disclosure or inspection of the answer books.  xxxx  xxxx  xxxx",

In the circumstances, when we find that all safeguards against errors and malpractices have been provided for, there cannot be said to be any denial of fair play to the examinees by reason of the prohibition against asking for revaluation.”",

The Commission will have to then send the copies of individual candidates to examiners for reevaluation which is bound to take time. The examination conducted by the Commission being a competitive examination, the declaration of final result will thus be unduly delayed and the vacancies will remain unfilled for a long time. What will happen if a candidate secures lesser marks in re-evaluation? He may come forward with a plea that the marks as originally awarded to him may be taken into consideration.

He had secured the required  50% marks in aggregate but had failed to secure 45% marks in the paper of Civil Law-II. Resultantly, he did not meet the qualifying criteria for being short-listed for viva voce. In the writ petition filed by respondent no.1, the High Court passed an order directing the appellant (Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission) to arrange a special interview for the respondent as the court found that there were some inconsistencies in framing two questions. The High Court also directed that the answer-sheets be sent to another re-examiner of a rank of reader-in-law of Himachal Pradesh University, for re-evaluation. On re-evaluation, the marks awarded to the candidate were higher than the qualifying threshold and the High Court directed Himachal Pradesh Public Commission to issue an appointment letter.
