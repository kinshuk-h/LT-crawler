It raised a preliminary objection that the claims raised by Welspun were premature as its contract with MSK/Welspun was on “back-to-back basis” with its contract with Nafto Gaz. It claimed that payments to Welspun could be considered only upon certification and release of the amounts from Nafto Gaz (IOCL to NCC). Since NCC  had neither received the certification nor payments, the claims to that extent were pre-mature and the cause of action for making such claims had not arisen. However, without prejudice to the said contention, NCC also claimed that Welspun’s claims were barred by limitation and were liable to be rejected on the principle analogous to Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereafter ‘the CPC’). The relevant extract of the Statement of Defence articulating the said preliminary objection, is set out below:  “9. The contention of NCC has always been that the contract with MSK now Welspun was on a back to back basis with the contract of NCC and NaftoGaz. Therefore, any claims or payments that Welspun may consider itself entitled to can be considered only upon certification and release of such amounts from NaftoGaz/IOCL to NCC. NCC has neither received the certification nor the payments. To that extent the claims as raised by Welspun are premature and the cause of action for the same has not arisen.  NCC is in no position to admit accept or pay any part of the claim since that depends upon certification by NaftoGaz and the release of payments by NaftoGaz/IOCL. This is also a specific term of the LOI/MOA.",

The  minority (Dissenting Award) found that Welspun was entitled to its claims (Claim nos. I, II and III) being the amounts due in terms of the certified Final Bill. However, Welspun’s Claim no. IV was not accepted on the ground that Welspun had not satisfied the requirement of Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

The counterparty could raise a valid objection to any step taken to refer the disputes to arbitration in avoidance of the agreed pre-reference dispute resolution procedure.

It is, therefore, crucial to determine when such ‘right to apply’ accrues in a case. As per the Court, the right to apply would accrue when differences between the parties to the arbitration agreement were evident – when the parties reach a ‘breaking point’, that is, when a settlement with or without conciliation is no longer possible. Pertinently, the Court noted that the limitation period would not start so long as the parties were in dialogue even if differences surfaced during such period, as an interpretation to the contrary would inevitably “compel the parties to resort to litigation / arbitration even where there is serious hope of the parties themselves resolving the issues”. Thus, the right to apply can be said to have accrued “only on the date of the last correspondence between the parties and the period of limitation commences from the date of the last communication between the parties.”",

Ltd. v. Chairman, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd. 28 enunciated the following principles:  (i)  Mere exchange of correspondence between the parties would not be sufficient to extend the time of limitation – specific pleadings and evidence qua the parties’ bona fide negotiation history should be placed on record for the careful consideration of the Court and for the benefit of limitation (as discussed above) to enure in favour of such party. On this basis, the Court ascertains the ‘breaking point’, that is, the point when a reasonable party would abandon settlement efforts and contemplate referring the dispute to arbitration.  (ii)  A party must not wait for an unreasonably long period to invoke the arbitration proceedings, if the counterparty does not settle and merely because written correspondences, including reminders, are being sent to the counterparty.  (iii)  Commercial or mercantile disputes are inherently different in nature from family disputes. The Supreme Court in Hari Shankar Singhania & Ors. v. Gaur Hari Singhania & Ors. 29 was concerned with a family dispute and the findings in that case were specifically rendered in that context. Thus, the threshold for determining the ‘breaking point’ in commercial disputes would differ – and would be lower – as parties in commercial settings are primarily interested in securing the amounts due to them.  (iv)  Whilst the scheme evolved under the A&C Act was different from the erstwhile Arbitration Act, 1940, the principles applicable in relation to the law of limitation under both the statues would be the same. Therefore, the Supreme Court affirmed that the three-year limitation period stipulated under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, applicable to arbitration proceedings, commenced under the Arbitration Act, 1940 would equally be applicable under the A&C Act in the context of appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the A&C Act.",

One of the principal questions that arises in this context is whether the time spent for complying with the pre-reference procedure is required to be excluded while calculating the period of limitation for referring the disputes to arbitration or whether the period of limitation would  commence after the said procedure has been exhausted. In this context, the decision of the Supreme Court in Geo Miller & Company Pvt. Ltd.  27 (2006) 5 SCC 275  28 Supra Note 15  29 Supra Note 23  Paragraph 28 of the said decision is relevant and set out below:  “28. Having perused through the relevant precedents, we agree that on a certain set of facts and circumstances, the period during which the parties were bona fide negotiating towards an amicable settlement may be excluded for the purpose of computing the period of limitation for reference to arbitration under the 1996 Act. However, in such cases the entire negotiation history between the parties must be specifically pleaded and placed on the record. The Court upon careful consideration of such history must find out what was the “breaking point” at which any reasonable party would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a settlement and contemplated referral of the dispute for arbitration. This “breaking point” would then be treated as the date on which the cause of action arises, for the purpose of limitation. The threshold for determining when such a point arises will be lower in the case of commercial disputes, where the party's primary interest is in securing the payment due to them, than in family disputes where it may be said that the parties have a greater stake in settling the dispute amicably, and therefore delaying formal adjudication of the claim.”",

The process for amicable resolution of disputes continued for almost six years before it was explicitly rejected. Thereafter, the disputes were referred to arbitration. In the arbitral proceedings, an objection was raised that the claims were barred by limitation. It was contended that the period of limitation commenced from the original date when the disputes had first arisen prior to reference of the same to the committee.

The learned Single Judge of this Court upheld the arbitral award and observed as under:  “20. On reading of the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal it would disclose that the arguments of the petitioner on the issue of limitation are without any force, as there is a finding of fact by the Arbitral Tribunal that the Variation Orders for the entire increased quantity were not issued on 26th March, 2003, and yet further the issue as to the revision of the rates was under the active consideration of the respondent for a very long time from 29th May, 2003, to 27th April, 2009, as the respondent had formed a Committee for revising the rates and forwarding the revised rates to NHAI for  approval, and the respondent had also appeared before the Committee in an attempt to amicably resolve the issue.

The owners of the vessel claimed damages for the delay caused to the vessel by fire. The charterers, on  the other hand, claimed damages for extra expenses incurred by them in arranging transport on account of the failure to discharge the vessel at the designated port. The parties engaged in negotiations for settlement of the disputes. The settlement efforts consumed the limitation period of three months provided for initiating arbitration in terms of the charterparty. The owners, nine days after the time limit had expired, applied to the Court (Master Lawrence) under Section 27 and their plea for extending the period of limitation was allowed.",

Thereafter, when the matter was referred to the Court of Appeal, the issue essentially came down to whether the owners were time-barred from initiating arbitration because they were nine days out of time. The Court of Appeal rendered a 2:1 decision, in favour of the owners. The decision was based on the interpretation of the phrase ‘undue hardship’ provided in Section 27 of the Arbitration Act, 1950. Lord Denning, in his majority opinion, held that the owners would suffer undue hardship if they were barred. Lord Salmon, in his separate concurring decision, observed that although the parties were breathing fire against each other, it was obvious from the letters that they did express willingness to meet and see if the matter could be settled. Accordingly, he observed that “I have no doubt at all that if two ordinary business men entering into this contract had been asked if it would cause undue hardship to refuse to extend the time should circumstances such as the present occur, they would both unhesitatingly have answered ‘Yes’.” Lord Salmon also enumerated  certain factors to be considered: the degree of blameworthiness of the claimants in failing to appoint an arbitrator within time; the amount at stake; the length of the delay; whether the claimants had been misled; and whether, through circumstances beyond their control, it was impossible for them to appoint an arbitrator in time. The majority, therefore, observed that not allowing an extension of limitation would cause undue hardship to the owners. Therefore, the appeal was allowed.  40 [1967] 2 WLR 856",

Your Client is well aware that huge amounts due and payable by Naftogaz not only pertaining to the flyover project executed by your Client but also in respect of the other projects executed by NCC have been withheld by Naftogaz/IOCL. Your client knowing fully well that the LOI which was issued on back to back basis is the foundation for the contract awarded to your Client willfully concealed the same. We also observe that your client vide letters dated 17.05.2011, 30.08.2011 and 09.09.2011 demanded payment of Rs.13.17 Crores towards the supposed out standings in respect of the contract executed by them and whereas through the legal notice you have claimed an amount of Rs.16,68,89,114/towards the supposed out standings. The figures appearing in the above referred letters of your Client and also those appearing in your notice are imaginary and have no basis. We observed from our records that subject to receiving the corresponding payment from Naftogaz an amount of Rs.2.56 Crores appears to be payable to your Client in respect of the works executed by them. As the contract awarded to your Clients is on back to back basis, the liability to make the payment even in respect of the said amount of Rs.2.56 Crores would arise only on receipt of the corresponding payment from Naftogaz. Your client is well aware that huge amounts for the works done by your client and also for the works done by NCC for Naftogaz are outstanding from Naftogaz for a very long time.  Your Client is also well aware that on account of failure of the various contractors who have executed the various items of work forming part of the EPCC – 9 project awarded by IOCL to Naftogaz the said IOCL has levied LDs including on the scope of work executed by your client. We reliably understand that discussions are in progress between Naftogaz and IOCL for refunding the amount recovered by them towards LDs. Your Clint willfully withheld disclosing the aforesaid levy of LDs in respect of the works executed by them. You will also note that the amounts claimed by your Client towards extra items of works were never submitted on time. Our liability to pay the amounts that were recovered towards LDs and also the payments towards extra claims if any could be considered only after we receive the corresponding payment from the Employer i.e. Naftogaz. You will also note that the amounts recovered by IOCL towards Retention Money is yet to be refunded till date. Our liability to remit the amounts due to your Client towards the Retention Money will arise only after release of the corresponding payment by Naftogaz.  Time and again, we have been continually appealing to your Client that the payments if any shall be cleared, if and only, upon the receipt of payments from the M/s Naftogaz. Therefore, we request your good selves to advise your Client that to be bound by the agreed terms and conditions of the LOI as such till M/s Naftogaz India Pvt. Ltd., releases the pending payments to us, we are not liable to clear the amounts as claimed by your Client and the same are disputed for the reasons stated above.”  [emphasis supplied]",

When the writ petition was initially entertained the Court had noted that the petitioner had been duly granted the requisite import permission by the competent authority in the office of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade1 . During the course of consideration, it came to the fore that although the petitioner‘s consignment had been duly inspected by the Delhi Police in terms of the statutory obligation placed by Rule 88(5) of the Arms Rules 20162 , certain queries came to be raised and clarifications were sought from the DGFT. The DGFT in turn is stated to have approached the Ministry of Home Affairs3 for providing appropriate clarifications. When the matter was thereafter taken up on 26 July 2022, the Court was informed that MHA had apprised the DGFT that the petitioner had breached the terms and conditions of the import license. Those issues stand duly highlighted in the order of the Court dated 26 July 2022, which is extracted hereinbelow:  ―1.

                        "content": "After exchange of pleadings, the matter was thereafter extensively heard on 30 August 2022. Since that order captures the essence of the dispute which has arisen, the same is extracted hereinbelow: - ―Having heard learned counsels for parties at some length, the Court notes that the present writ petition gives rise to the following issues. The petitioner had approached this Court aggrieved by the fact that arms and parts of arms which had been imported by him pursuant to permission granted by the respondents were not being released.  The Bills of Entry with which the present writ petition is concerned are as follows: - I.  Bill of Entry no. 9037350 dated 09/06/2022 for 500 Frames.  II.  Bill of Entry no. 9038081 dated 09/06/2022 for 500 Slides and 1000 Magazines.  The petitioner had contended that as long as it held the requisite import permissions for import of Slides and Frames, there existed no legal impediment which would have justified the retention of those goods.  In accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Arms Rules, 2016 [“the 2016 Rules”], the Delhi Police appears to have undertaken an inspection of the consignments which form subject matter of the present writ petition and addressed a communication of 21 June 2022 to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade [DGFT]. It referred to the fact that on inspection it found that the Frames which had been imported had the following additional parts already fitted thereto: - a.  Hammer  b.  Catch magazine,  c.  Safety lock  d.  Safety lock support pin,  e.  Trigger Action Mechanism Part  f.   Trigger  Similarly, in respect of Slides, it pointed out that the said article also had the following parts already fitted in each Slide:- i  Firing Pin  ii.  Spring of firing pin  iii.  Lock plate of firing Pin  iv.  Extractor  The case of the petitioner is that it holds a valid license FOR manufacture of a complete firearm in terms of Form VII which is held and possessed and that consequently it did not require any separate license or permission to manufacture or import components or parts of a firearm. It was pointed that even under the terms of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020 and the ITC (HS) Classification, these parts and components are not separately classified and would all fall for within the compendious entry of “Parts and accessories of articles of headings 93.01 to 93.04”. Those entries pertain to military weapons and other firearms as specified therein.  It was additionally submitted that there is no justification for the respondents taking the position that a Slide or a Frame when imported should not be fitted with additional components of a firearm. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that at least the Arms Act, 1959 [“the Act”] and the Rules frame thereunder do not contemplate or envisage the import of a Frame or a Slide shorn of a component or part of firearm embedded in them.  Reverting then to the communication which was addressed by the Delhi Police, the DGFT appears to have sought the opinion and advice of the Ministry of Home Affairs [MHA]. The MHA has opined that the import permission which had been granted would not cover parts or  components of a firearm which were found fitted to the Frame and the Slide. It has additionally referred to the provisions contained in Rule 57(4) of the 2016 Rules. Both Ms. Raman and Mr. Singh, learned CGSCs have sought to justify the position as set out in the counter affidavit as well as the advice proffered by MHA. They would contend that the import permissions stood restricted to a Slide or the Frame alone and that consequently the import permission cannot be viewed as permitting the petitioner to import a Frame or a Slide with additional parts fitted to it.  It was also pointed out to the Court that the provisions contained in the 2016 Rules and more particularly Rule 88(2) thereof require an importer to obtain a requisite license in terms of Form X which stands placed and appended to those Rules. It was contended that no such license was obtained. Mr. Singh would contend that while the powers of the Licensing Authority under the Act may have been duly delegated to the DGFT in terms of the notification of 01 November 2018, that would not absolve the petitioner from the additional requirement of obtaining the requisite license for import under the 2016 Rules. Notwithstanding the above and since the import permission had been duly granted by the DGFT itself, Mr. Singh submits that the respondents shall consider the grant of that license ex-post facto in order to regularize the consignment which has been duly imported by the petitioner.  Mr. Singh has then relied upon the provisions made in Rule 57(4) of the 2016 Rules to contend that the moment parts of arms and ammunition which cannot possibly be manufactured locally are sought to be imported, the importer is duty bound to move the MHA by way of an application which would in turn obtain the opinion of the Department of Defense before granting an authorization for such import. According to Mr. Singh, this procedure too does not appear to have been followed or enforced by the respondents prior to the grant of import permission.  The Court notes that presently the question whether the components of arms which stand embedded to the Frame and Slides are of such a character or quality which cannot be manufactured locally is an issue which is yet to be examined by the respondents. This, the Court notes since the provisions of Rule 57(4) of the 2016 Rules would come into play only if it were found that those parts cannot be manufactured locally. The Court further notes that the Delhi Police while conducting the inspection had only raised a doubt with respect to the validity of the import on the ground that the Frames and Slide had other components of arms fitted to them. The issue of Rule 57(4) had been raised only by the MHA in its advisory to the DGFT. The Court also takes note of the submission of learned counsel for the petitioner who contended that while the aforesaid objections are being raised insofar as the consignment imported by the petitioner is concerned, various other importers have  been permitted to import parts and components of firearms without being required to either obtain an import license as envisaged under Rule 88(2) or any authorization by the MHA as contemplated under Rule 57(4) of the 2016 Rules.  The additional grievance which is raised is that apart from the consignment which forms subject matter of the present writ petition, thirteen other consignments of the petitioner have also been detained as a consequence of the controversy which has arisen here.  The Court also takes note of the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner who submits that the expression ―manufacturing” as defined in Rule 2(31) would clearly indicate that it is permissible for a person to manufacture or produce either a complete firearm or a component thereof. Referring then to the provisions contained in Rules 2(29) and 2(37) of the 2016 Rules as well as the Explanation added to the statutory forms, it was submitted that the amendments to those forms in terms of which various of components of firearms have come to be inserted and added, is merely to meet the contingency where a person may choose to manufacture or import only a particular component or a part of a firearm rather than the complete firearm. Viewed in that backdrop, learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the perceived requirement of a separate license or import permission being obtained for those components also cannot be countenanced.  Bearing in the mind the aforesaid facts, the Court in the interim passes the following directions.  In light of the suggestions mooted by Mr. Singh, learned CGSC, let the competent authorities in the MHA as well as the DGFT jointly consider the issues which stand flagged in this order and place their stand before the Court within a period of two weeks from today.  The Court further requests the competent authorities in the DGFT, Customs, the Delhi Police as well as the MHA to attend to the grievance of the petitioner with respect to the thirteen other consignments which are stated to have been detained. For the purposes of enabling the respondents to undertake the aforesaid exercise, the petitioner shall provide the details of the thirteen other consignments which are stated to have been detained forthwith.

In the course of consideration of the present writ petition, the respondents had also adverted to the provisions contained in Rule 57(4) of the 2016 Rules and assert that it was incumbent upon the petitioner to have obtained the permission and approval of the MHA before effecting import. In view of the admitted failure of the petitioner to have obtained that permission, the respondents would contend that the consignment is not liable to be released.",

In view of the above, it was submitted that the petitioner could not be faulted for the respondents having failed to consider the grant of a license additionally in Form X. On a more fundamental plane, it was vehemently argued that there is no justification for the respondents taking the view that the Slides and Frames as imported did not conform to the import permission that was granted. It was submitted that Slides and Frames would clearly fall within the ambit of “Parts and accessories of articles of Heading 9301 to 9304” as set forth in  the Indian Trade Clarification based on Harmonized System Classification8 . Learned counsel would submit that once the respondents had accorded the permission for import of Slides and Frames, there existed no legal justification for the validity of those imports being questioned merely because those Slides and Frames came fitted with certain additional components of a firearm. It was urged on behalf of the petitioners that the Explanations which stand appended to Forms VII and X-A and which chronicle the various components of a firearm, is only to take care of the contingency where a manufacturer may be engaged either in the production of a complete firearm or merely a particular component thereof. Similarly, according to the petitioners the Explanation which stands set out in Form X-A also must necessarily be understood as covering the eventuality of an entity exporting any of the components or parts of a firearm that are mentioned therein.",

The contention essentially was that as long as a Slide or Frame fell within the scope of the aforesaid definitions, the mere fact that it constituted an amalgam of more than one component of a firearm could not be said to be a violation of the import permission that was granted. The petitioners then submitted that Rule 57(4) can clearly have no application since it is not the case of the respondents that the imported articles could not be possibly  manufactured locally. It was urged that sub-rule (4) of Rule 57 would only apply and oblige an importer to approach the MHA only in case the import of parts of arms and ammunitions ―are not possible to be manufactured locally‖. In any case, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would contend that once the import had been duly sanctioned by the DGFT, the refusal to release the consignment based upon a subsequent advisory which may have been issued by the MHA is wholly arbitrary and illegal.  8 ITC (HS)",

It was the submission of Ms. Raman that the Delhi Police in its communication of 21 June 2022 had clearly recorded that the Slides and Frames which had been imported had been found to be installed with various additional operational parts of a firearm and thus in probable violation of the import permission which was granted.

The objection essentially was that the operational parts which were found to be fitted to the Slides and Frames were liable to viewed as independent components of a firearm and for which a separate import permission was liable to be obtained. This submission was addressed in the backdrop of the definition of ―main firearm component” set out in Rule 2(29) and the phrase ―parts and components” as defined by Rule 2(37).

                        "content": "On a foundational level, this Court finds itself unable to interpret Rules 2(29) and 2(37), in a manner which may lend credence to the submission that a Frame or a Slide must, for the purposes of import, be understood to mean an article which does not have any other component or part of a firearm embedded in them. It must at the outset be noted that the expression “main firearm component” has been defined in Rule 2(29) to “mean” the barrel, frame or receiver, slide, bolt or breach block of a firearm. Rule 2(37) while defining the expression ―parts and components‖ does not independently notice or classify any other part or component of a firearm other than the four components which are also spelt out in Rule 2(29). The Court also bears in mind that Rule 2(37) uses the both the words “mean” and “includes”. Both those Rules are therefore liable to be interpreted and understood as being exhaustive. Although it is by now well settled that where a statutory provision uses both the words “means” and “includes”, irrespective of whether the two are separated by additional words while attempting to define a word or phrase is liable to be viewed as exhaustive, the Court recalls the succinct enunciation of this principle in P.  P.  Kasilingam v. P.S.G. College of Technology 13 where their Lordships of the Supreme Court observed thus:- ―19. We will first deal with the contention urged by Shri Rao based on the provisions of the Act and the Rules. It is no doubt true that in view of clause  (3) of Section 1 the Act applies to all private colleges. The expression ‗college‘ is, however, not defined in the Act. The expression ―private college‖ is defined in clause (8) of Section 2 which can, in the absence of any indication of a contrary intention, cover all colleges including professional and technical colleges. An indication about such an intention is, however, given in the Rules wherein the expression ‗college‘ has been defined in Rule 2(b) to mean and include Arts and Science College, Teachers' Training College, Physical Education College, Oriental College, School of Institute of Social Work and Music College. While enumerating the various types of colleges in Rule 2(b) the rule-making authority has deliberately refrained from including professional and technical colleges in the said definition. It has been urged that in Rule 2(b) the expression ―means and includes‖ has been used which indicates that the definition is inclusive in nature and also covers categories which are not expressly mentioned therein. We are unable to agree. A particular expression is often defined by the Legislature by using the word ‗means‘ or the word ‗includes‘. Sometimes the words ‗means and includes‘ are used. The use of the word ‗means‘ indicates that ―definition is a hard-and-fast definition, and no other meaning can be assigned to the expression than is put down in definition‖. (See : Gough v. Gough [(1891) 2 QB 665 : 60 LJ QB 726] ; Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corpn. Ltd. v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court [(1990) 3 SCC 682, 717 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 71] .) The word ‗includes‘ when used, enlarges the meaning of the expression defined so as to comprehend not only such things as they signify according to their natural import but also those things which the clause declares that they shall include. The words ―means and includes‖, on the other hand, indicate ―an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions‖. (See : Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps [1899 AC 99, 105-106 : (1895-9) All ER Rep Ext 1576] (Lord Watson); Mahalakshmi Oil Mills v. State of A.P. [(1989) 1 SCC 164, 169 : 1989 SCC (Tax) 56] The use of the words ―means and includes‖ in Rule 2(b) would, therefore, suggest that the definition of ‗college‘ is intended to be exhaustive and not extensive and would cover only the educational institutions falling in the categories specified in Rule 2(b) and other educational institutions are not comprehended. Insofar as engineering colleges are concerned, their exclusion may be for the reason that the opening and running of the private engineering colleges are controlled through the Board of Technical Education and Training and the Director of Technical Education in accordance with the directions issued by the AICTE from time to time. As noticed earlier the Grants-in-Aid Code contains provisions which, in many respects, cover the same field as is covered by the Act and the Rules. The Director of Technical Education has been entrusted with the functions of proper implementation of those provisions. There is nothing to show that the said arrangement was not working satisfactorily so as to be replaced by the  system sought to be introduced by the Act and the Rules. Rule 2(d), on the other hand, gives an indication that there was no intention to disturb the existing arrangement regarding private engineering colleges because in that rule the expression ‗Director‘ is defined to mean the Director of Collegiate Education. The Director of Technical Education is not included in the said definition indicating that the institutions which are under the control of Directorate of College Education only are to be covered by the Act and the Rules and technical educational institutions in the State of Tamil Nadu which are controlled by the Director of Technical Education are not so covered.‖  13 1995 Supp (2) SCC 348",

In Pioneer Urban, their Lordships were considering the correctness of the view expressed in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti Vs.

(a) “agricultural produce” means such items of produce of agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, apiculture, sericulture, pisciculture, animal husbandry or forest as are specified in the Schedule, and includes admixture of two or more of such items, and also includes any such item in  processed form, and further includes gur, rab, shakkar, khandsari and jaggery.‘  ***",

A perusal of the definition of ―agricultural produce‖ under Section 2(a) of the Act shows that apart from items of produce of agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, piculture, sericulture, pisciculture, animal husbandry or forest as are specified in the Schedule, the definition further ―includes admixture of two or more such items‖ and thereafter it further ―includes taking any such item in processed form‖ and again for the third time the words used are ―and further includes gur, rab, shakkar, khandsari and jaggery‖. It is a well-settled rule of interpretation that where the legislature uses the words ―means‖ and ―includes‖ such definition is to be given a wider meaning and is not exhaustive or restricted to the items contained or included in such definition. Thus the meaning of ―agricultural produce‖ in the above definition is not restricted to any products of agriculture as specified in the Schedule but also includes such items which come into being in processed form and further includes such items which are called as gur, rab, shakkar, khandsari and jaggery.‖",

PSG College of Technology, 1995 Supp (2) SCC 348] ), this Court set out definition sections where the expression ―means‖ was followed by some words, after which came the expression ―and includes‖ followed by other words, just as in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti case [Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Shankar Industries, 1993 Supp (3) SCC 361 (2)] . In two other recent judgments, Bharat Coop. Bank (Mumbai) Ltd. v. Employees Union [Bharat Coop. Bank (Mumbai) Ltd. v. Employees Union, (2007) 4 SCC 685 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 82] , SCC paras 12 and 23 and State of W.B. v. Associated Contractors [State of W.B. v. Associated Contractors, (2015) 1 SCC 32 : (2015) 1 SCC (Civ) 1] , SCC para 14, this Court has held that wherever the expression ―means‖ is followed by the expression ―and includes‖ whether with or without additional words separating ―means‖ from ―includes‖, these expressions indicate that the definition provision is exhaustive as a matter of statutory  interpretation. It has also been held that the expression ―and includes‖ is an expression which extends the definition contained in words which follow the expression ―means‖. From this discussion, two things follow. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti [Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Shankar Industries, 1993 Supp (3) SCC 361 (2)] cannot be said to be good law insofar as its exposition on ―means‖ and ―includes‖ is concerned, as it ignores earlier precedents of larger and coordinate Benches and is out of sync with later decisions on the same point. Equally, Dr Singhvi's argument that clauses (a) to (i) of Section 5(8) of the Code must all necessarily reflect the fact that a financial debt can only be a debt which is disbursed against the consideration for the time value of money, and which permeates clauses (a) to (i), cannot be accepted as a matter of statutory interpretation, as the expression ―and includes‖ speaks of subject-matters which may not necessarily be reflected in the main part of the definition.‖  14 (2019) 8 SCC 416  15 1993 Supp (3) SCC 361  In view of the above enunciation of the principles which would govern the interpretation to be accorded to Rules 2(29) and 2(37), it would be incorrect to employ the precepts of liberal construction or attempt to expand the meaning assigned to the expressions ―main firearm component‖ or ―parts and components‖ as contained in the 2016 Rules. The Court for the aforesaid reasons also finds itself unable to sustain the view expressed by the MHA which had erroneously noted that the definition was ―inclusive‖.",

The additional components which are chronicled in Form VII could at best be said to fall in the definition of the word “manufacturing” as set out in Rule 2(31) which significantly while defining components of a firearm uses the expressions “e.g.” and “etc.”.  The submission of the respondents pivoting upon the Explanation to Form VII and on the basis whereof it was argued that since other components of a firearm are separately noted and classified alongside a Slide and Frame, it must consequently be held that the expression Frame or Slide would have to be understood to mean one which has no other pre-installed operational parts also lacks merit for the following reasons.",

That Form is not meant for the purposes of import at all. In any case, the Court notes that the expressions ―manufacturer‖ and ―manufacturing‖ as set forth in Rules 2(30) and 2(31) clearly contemplate a person being engaged in the manufacture of either a complete firearm or one or more of its parts and components. The statute thus clearly envisages a situation where an entity may be engaged in the manufacture of either a complete firearm or merely a part or a component thereof. It is to take care of the aforesaid contingency alone that the Explanation appears to have been added in Form VII. Additionally, the use of the expressions ―eg.‖ and ‗etc.‖ in Rule 2(31) appears to be indicative of the intention of the framers to refrain from exhaustively or comprehensively specifying the various parts and accessories of a firearm. This provision is indubitably distinct from the manner in which Rules 2(29) and 2(37) stand crafted. Ultimately, it is the meaning liable to be ascribed to ―main firearm component‖ and ―parts and components‖ thereof as contained in the aforenoted two statutory provisions which would govern.",

The Court also bears in mind that catch magazine, safety lock, safety lock support pin, trigger action mechanism part, trigger, spring of firing pin and lock plate of firing pin, the additional components which were noticed by the third respondent in its communication of 21 June 2022, are neither mentioned in Rules 2(29) and 2(31) nor are they specified in the Explanation forming part of Form VII.

The expression “parts of firearms” would necessarily have to draw colour from Rule 2(29) and 2(37). The Court is thus of the firm view that merely because some of the albeit well-recognised and accepted parts or components of a firearm are independently noticed in Rule 2(31) and which pertains to the activity of manufacture of firearms, it would be unsound to import its provisions for the purposes of interpreting the phrase ―parts of firearms‖ when sought to be imported. In any case, as this Court views  Rules 2(29) and 2(37) read with the other relevant provisions of the Act and the 2016 Rules, it finds itself unable to countenance the submission that a Frame or a Slide must be understood to mean a component of a firearm which should not or cannot be pre-fitted with other parts thereof.",

It becomes relevant to note that the expression accessory or attachment has been defined in Clause 9.01 falling in Chapter 9 of the FTP to mean a part, sub-assembly or assembly that contributes to the efficiency of a piece of equipment without changing it basic functions. The phrase “Parts and accessories of articles….” in Heading 9305 of the ITC (HS) is liable to be interpreted in the aforesaid light. Viewed from this angle also the Court finds itself unable to countenance the submission that a Frame or Slide must not contain any other additional component or part of a firearm fitted onto it. It would also be apposite to recollect the provisions contained in Rule 3(b) of the Tariff Interpretation Rules which prescribes that in case of composite goods which may be made of different components, they shall be classified as if they consisted of the components which gives them their essential character. It was thus incumbent upon the respondents to have established that the additional components and operational parts found fixed to the Frames and Slides were liable to be separately classified and that the ITC (HS) did not envisage a Frame or a Slide being pre-fitted with any additional component. As this Court views the relevant provisions made in the FTP and ITC (HS), it finds itself unable to either appreciate or sustain the bifurcation of the product which was  imported as suggested by the respondents. The ITC(HS) in Heading 9305 compendiously classifies all parts and components of a firearm. No provision of the FTP or the ITC(HS) seems to suggest that the parts which were noticed in the communication of 21 June 2022 are either recognised as independent components under the statutory regime which governs or that the policy of import forbids parts and accessories being imported in a composite form.",

The entry which now survives and forms part of the 2022 Edition of the HS merely refers to parts and accessories of firearms and is in tune with the ITC(HS).

The Court has already found that neither the  provisions contained in the FTP, the ITC (HS) nor the 2016 Rules ordain or can be interpreted to mean that a Frame or Slide should not contain an additional component or part of a firearm. The Court recalls the well-established principle of interpretation that where a doubt arises with respect to tariff entries, words and entries appearing therein are to be understood in the sense that the trade, public or consumer construes them. Entries in a tariff schedule, as per the aforesaid principle, which has now come to be popularly termed as the “common parlance test” bids us to interpret and understand entries as construed in their commercial or trade understanding. The aforesaid principles and the body of precedent which has evolved on the subject was elaborately noticed in CCE Vs. Connaught Plaza Restaurants (P) Ltd.16 as under: - - ―20. Time and again, the principle of common parlance as the standard for interpreting terms in the taxing statutes, albeit subject to certain exceptions, where the statutory context runs to the contrary, has been reiterated.

Resort to rigid interpretation in terms of scientific and technical meanings should be avoided in such circumstances. This, however, is by no means an absolute rule.

The Court fails to find any justification for the aforesaid interpretation as accorded since the view as expressed could have been sustained, provided the Act and the 2016 Rules did envisage each part or component being entitled to be viewed as a separate and distinct component for the purposes of interpretation and understanding its provisions. The view as taken, in any case, clearly falters in light of the provisions made in Rules 2(30) and 2(31) which, as was noticed above, clearly contemplate a contingency where a manufacturer may be engaged in the making or producing a complete firearm or merely a component thereof.

The aforesaid opinion as expressed is also clearly rendered unsustainable since the petitioner did hold a license for manufacture of a complete firearm. Before this Court it was conceded on behalf of the respondents that if the manufacturer had been granted a license to manufacture a complete firearm it was not placed under any additional statutory obligation  to obtain separate licenses for manufacturing parts or components of a firearm. In fact such an interpretation cannot also be sustained upon a reading of the various conditions which stand imposed and attached to the grant of a license to manufacture in terms of Form VII. The Form and the Explanation clarifies that it would apply to firearms and its various parts such as barrel, cylinder, bolt, breech block, slide, firing pin, frame or receiver, extractor and hammer/striker. The sub categorisation of the various components of a firearm appears to have been introduced to deal with a contingency where a manufacturer may, as distinct from making a complete firearm, choose to apply for the grant of a license to manufacture any of its individual components as specified in clauses (a) to (i) of the Explanation to Form VII. The further conclusions which are recorded in the advisory of the MHA and more particularly in Para 5 thereof again proceed on the premise that the import of Frames and Slides must necessarily be understood to mean that they would not be embedded with any additional parts and components of a firearm.

Rule 57(4) thus stands confined to those cases where the part or component which is sought to be imported is not being  manufactured or cannot possibly be manufactured in the country.  However, in the present case it was not the contention of the respondents that the nature and character of Slides and Frames which were being imported by the petitioner could not be manufactured locally.

Although the MHA in its advisory has alluded to Rule 57(4), it has not taken the stand that the Act and the 2016 permit import of only such parts of arms which are not being manufactured locally. As this Court views Rule 57(4) it appears to place an obligation upon an importer to obtain the requisite permission of the MHA only in a case where the article proposed to be imported is one which is either not being manufactured or possible to be manufactured locally. The Court thus finds itself unable to conversely read or interpret Rule 57(4) as prohibiting the import of arms or parts thereof which can be manufactured locally, a view which was commended for acceptance by Mr. Endlaw, learned counsel for the Intervener only.",

Firstly, and when tested on the anvil of the Act and the 2016 Rules, the  Court notes that Section 10 of the Act read with Rule 88 of the 2016 Rules only introduces a stipulation of a license being obtained for the purposes of import. Neither those provisions nor the various applications and forms connected with the subject of import, incorporate a prohibition against parts of arms which can be manufactured locally. The MHA while delegating its powers comprised in Section 10 of the Act to the DGFT also does not introduce any such prohibition. In fact, if Rule 57(4) were to be read in the manner as suggested by and on behalf of the Intervener, there would exist no justification for the MHA delegating its powers of licensing comprised in Section 10 read with Rule 88. This since if the parts of arms were such as were not being manufactured locally, the importer would still be obliged to follow the route of Rule 57(4). Quite apart from the fact that the aforesaid view was neither advocated by the MHA nor the DGFT and is not the stand reflected in their orders or the affidavits filed in these proceedings, the acceptance of this line of argument would give rise to an irreconcilable conflict between Rule 57(4) and Rule 88 of the 2016 Rules and be contrary to the letter of the delegation notifications issued by the MHA. In any case the act of the respondents in granting the Form X license subsequently and during the pendency of the writ petition is clear evidence that they do not view the import in question being prohibited on lines as suggested by and on behalf of the Intervener.",

The respondents had urged that the requirement of obtaining a license under Form X is a stipulation which continues to apply notwithstanding the import permission granted by the DGFT. This submission was made in light of the contention addressed on  behalf of the petitioner that once the power to issue an import permission stood delegated to the DGFT, there is no legal obligation on an importer to apply for and obtain a license under Form X. The Court notes that Section 10 of the Act specifically deals with the power to issue licenses in connection with import of arms and parts thereof. It is that power which stands delegated and transferred to the DGFT. The DGFT has thus for all practical purposes stepped into the shoes of the MHA which was prior to the delegation acting as the licensing authority. While this issue no longer survives in this petition in light of the respondents having subsequently granted the license, it may only be observed that the DGFT while dealing with the subject of import of arms would have to ensure that compliances are affected not just with reference to the 1992 Act but also the Act and the 2016 Rules.",

However the Court notes that the liability to bear demurrage charges shifts from the importer to the licensing and the customs authorities if any delay be caused in inspecting the consignment as per Rule 88(6) of the 2016 Rules. The third respondent however in the facts of the present case cannot be called upon to shoulder that liability since it had dutifully inspected the consignment within the time specified in Rule 88(6). That authority has thus not caused any delay so as to warrant any directions being framed against it and as claimed in the writ petition. More fundamentally and bearing in mind the contentious  questions which came to be raised, the facts of the present case would not warrant the grant of relief (d) as claimed in the writ petition.",

This principle has also been expounded by the Supreme Court.7 In S.

From the reading of Section 27(2) of the Act, it is clear that the right of action of any person for passing off the goods/services of another person and remedies thereof are not affected by the provisions of the Act.

Conjoint reading of Sections 34, 27 and 28 would show that the rights of registration are subject to Section 34 which can be seen from the opening words of Section 28 of the Act which states •Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor....• and also the opening words of Section 34 which states •Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere...• Thus, the scheme of the Act is such where rights of prior user are recognised superior than that of the registration and even the registered proprietor cannot disturb/interfere with the rights of prior user. The overall effect of collective reading of the provisions of the Act is that the action for passing off which is premised on the rights of prior user generating a goodwill shall be unaffected by any registration provided under the Act. This proposition has been discussed in extenso in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn. [N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn., 1995 SCC OnLine Del 310 : AIR 1995 Del 300] wherein the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court recognised that the registration is not an indefeasible right and the same is subject to rights of prior user.

However, if the objection of invalidity is raised by the opposing party, a subsisting trademark registration does not preclude the Court from forming a prima facie view on the objection, even at the interlocutory stage. In this regard, it would be pertinent to note that Division Bench of this Court in Marico Limited v. Agro Food Limited, 8 while examining the interplay between Sections 28, 31 and 124 of the Act, held that it would be permissible for Courts to prima facie examine validity of registration for the purposes of deciding interlocutory applications.

The German Appellate Court vide order dated 16th October, 2009 in an appeal by SHAMROCK (Defendants therein), made following observations (as per translated copy) qua the Supply Contract and Supply License Agreement:  •The defendants cannot rely on the conclusion of the •delivery contract for soil solidification additives• concluded between the applicant and the defendant for 1st and 2nd /18.7.2007 (Appendix Ast 5) the use of the trademark •GeoCrete• is permitted and therefore does not use the domain names in question within the meaning of Art. 9 para. 1 sentence 2 of GMV would use •without consent•. Although it is true that, according to S 3 of the contract, the applicant is obliged to manufacture, deliver to the products •GeoCrete ST• and •GeoCrete IM• for the defendants to 1st and 2nd and to label the products in accordance with S 9 with the trademark •GeoCrete,• the applicant owns in accordance with Contract only the distribution rights for the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as well as Equatorial Guinea, otherwise distribution will take place via the defendant to 2. It can be deduced from this by interpretation (SS 133, 157 BGB) that the defendants should be entitled to distribute the contract products produced and delivered by the applicant under the trademark •GeoCrete! To market. In fact, however, the defendants no longer have the products manufactured by the applicant due to disputes since 2008.  xx  • xx  • xx  For the same reason, the defendants cannot rely on the supply agreement between the applicant and the defendant for the 2nd delivery agreement concluded on August 12, 2005 (Appendix VB 9). Even under this contract, the defendant should be solely obliged and entitled to use the name •GeoCrete• when selling her products manufactured using the special binders manufactured by the applicant. Such products are no longer undisputedly distributed by the applicants. In this context, therefore, it is not necessary to decide whether the contract of 12.8.2005 with a view to the subsequent agreement of July 18, 2007 (Appendix Ast 5) still exists at all.•  [Emphasis Supplied]",

A prima facie analysis of the documents relied upon depicts that SHAMROCK•s claims of use/prior use of the impugned mark in India is not supported by any credible material; SHAMROCK has failed to prove the adoption and use of the •proposed to be used• mark in India. Neither has there been actual sale of goods to which the impugned mark is applied, nor any proof of non-sales activities such as promotion/ advertisement of the impugned mark has been shown. The documents referred above demonstrate that the limited use of the impugned mark by SHAMROCK was consequent to express authorisation or licensing by TIMAB, and not vice versa. SHAMROCK had no independent right to use the impugned mark which belongs to TIMAB. Mere registration of a mark by the Trade Mark Registry does not prove its use by the proprietor in whose name the said mark was registered. Due to lack of documentary proof and inability of SHAMROCK to sustain its claim of use in India, its registration of the impugned mark and the rights flowing therefrom become subservient to superior rights of prior user i.e., TIMAB, which are discussed in later segments of this judgement. The Court is unable to agree that SHAMROCK has been sufficiently using the impugned mark in India entitling it to seek an injunction against TIMAB. It has also not demonstrated any claim of passing off against TIMAB, which would entitle it to an injunction on the basis of common law rights.",

                        "content": "SHAMROCK implored the Court to disregard the afore-noted orders, contending that they are irrelevant for the purpose of the present proceedings and pertain to the use of domain names by Mr. Korytowski and his companies in the European jurisdiction only, and therefore, are not applicable in India. Further, Mr. Chandra had also emphasised that the Courts in Germany have not taken into consideration or have not interpreted the agreements that existed between Van Mannekus and/ or GCBV and Mr. Korytowski and his companies. He further attempted to  highlight that the Courts in Germany refrained from taking into consideration the registration of the impugned mark in Switzerland and Africa in the name of GCC, as the same was not deemed to be relevant for the purpose of said proceedings. In the opinion of the Court, Mr. Chandra•s contention is incorrect. The orders of the Courts in Germany cannot be brushed aside lightly. The Courts in Germany have examined and interpreted the contracts, contrary to Mr. Chandra•s assertion. At this interim stage, the view taken by the Courts in Germany relating to the impugned mark on the basis of contractual rights arising from agreements, which were also cited before this Court, is therefore certainly persuasive. It is not disputed by SHAMROCK that it does not have any manufacturing facility in India and the goods are being imported from Germany, where presently, in terms of order passed by Courts in Germany, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark. On a pointed query of the Court, Mr. Chandra conceded that, at the place of origin of the goods, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark on the goods. Thus, the use of the impugned mark by SHAMROCK, if at all, is being done after import of goods in India.  16 As recorded in order dated 24th February, 2009 of the Hamburg Regional Court.",

However, for restraining SHAMROCK (registered proprietor) from using the impugned mark, apart from prior use, TIMAB must also establish that its common law rights have been violated and SHAMROCK is passing off the impugned mark as its own. In order to sustain its claims of passing off, TIMAB must satisfy the classic trinity test of •Goodwill, Misrepresentation and Damages• as propounded in Reckitt and Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc & Ors., 18 and affirmed by Courts in India.19 It must be established that there is substantial goodwill or reputation in public of the impugned mark attached to TIMAB, which distinguishes it from its competitors. Next, intentional or unintentional misrepresentation by SHAMROCK must be shown, which results in public belief that •GeoCrete• products are offered by it.

Learned senior counsel argued that as far as the “extent” or “scope” of the control taken over is concerned, the COTPA is a comprehensive, self-contained, seamless legislation regulating the whole field of tobacco and allied products. Sections 4, 5 and 6 provide for prohibition; Section 7 lays down restrictions; Sections 8, 9 and 10 regulates packaging of tobacco products. Thus, it is apparent that the COTPA does not envisage product prohibition.  Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Union of India v. W.P.(C) 3362/2015 & other connected matters Page 52 of 162 47. In any view, the fact that COTPA occupies the entire field relating to tobacco products cannot be disputed. Hence, the source of all actions qua regulation/prohibition of any form of tobacco shall be governed by the COTPA. Admittedly, the Impugned Notifications have been issued under the FSSA; and since the FSSA transgresses into an “occupied field”, such an action would be ultra vires and illegal.

Thus, the power to prohibit did not vest in the Food Commissioner at all. The regime had moved from implementation and monitoring to self-regulation.

Secondly, not only is the language referring to “tobacco and nicotine” used in Regulation 2.3.4 is clear, unequivocal and unqualified, as explained above, but it must be deemed to take colour from pre-existing definitions of tobacco, e.g. the clear elaborations found in the Schedule read with Section 3(p) of the COTPA.",

He further emphasized that consuming raw tobacco otherwise is very bitter and is not palatable to most of the consumers. So, in order to enhance its taste and increase sales, this mixture which is well known as Gutka is sold in the market circumventing the orders of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. Relevant part of the report submitted by the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, Munirka, New Delhi is reproduced hereunder:  The term 'smokeless tobacco' includes a large variety of commercially or non-commercially available products and mixtures that contain tobacco as the principal constituent and are used either orally (through the mouth) or nasally (through the nose) without combustion (Annexure1 (a)).  Oral use of smokeless tobacco is widely prevalent in India and different methods of its consumption include chewing, sucking and applying tobacco preparations to the teeth and gums (Annexure 2). According to the monograph developed by the International Agency for Research in Cancer (lARC) of the World Health Organization (Annexure 1 (a)), the three forms of smokeless tobacco which are commonly used orally include:  a)  Tobacco alone (with aroma and flavourings) -e.g Creamy or dry snuff, Gudakhu, Gul, Mishri, Red tooth powder  b)  Tobacco with other components (lime, sodium bicarbonate, ash) -e.g Khaini, Zarda, Maras, Naswar  c)  Betel quid with tobacco (includes areca nut, slaked lime, catechu and tobacco with spices) -e.g Betel quid, Gutkha, Mawa  For nasal use, a small quantity of very fine tobacco powder mixed with aromatic substances called dry snuff is inhaled. This form of smokeless tobacco use, although still practiced, is not very common in India. Snus is a form of snuff using moist tobacco powder, consumed by placing it under the lip for extended periods of time (Annexure 2).  The brands and common names of different products of chewing tobacco (smokeless tobacco) used in India have been enumerated in the proceeding of a meeting conducted by the National Cancer Institute, USA and the Centre for Disease Control, USA (Annexure 3).  In addition to the above mentioned smokeless tobacco products used orally, various mixtures of betel-quid without tobacco are also commonly used in India. A 'betel quid' (synonymous with 'pan' or 'paan') generally contains betel leaf, areca/betel nut (or supari) and slaked lime, and may or  may not contain tobacco. In other words, it usually contains at least one of the two basic ingredients tobacco or areca nut, in raw or any manufactured or processed form. Other substances, particularly spices, including cardamom, saffron, cloves, aniseed, turmeric, mustard or sweeteners, are added to betel quid according to local preferences. (Annexure 4 (a))  Pan masala is very similar to a betel quid except that all its ingredients are in dehydrated and granular/powdered form. Gutkha is a mixture of Pan masala and chewing form of tobacco.”",

He submitted that on the basis of various data and studies conducted, it is evident that 21% adults used only smokeless tobacco and only 9% use smoking tobacco, and 5% use smoking as well as smokeless tobacco. He further emphasized that the study suggests that it is almost impossible to quit smokeless tobacco. Relevant part of the report referred by the learned senior counsel is reproduced hereunder:  The two key ingredients of smokeless tobacco and betel-quid products are tobacco and arecanut, and the chemical composition and effects of these two ingredients are quite different. Hence the evidence on the harmful effects of smokeless tobacco and areca/betel nut (or supari) has been reviewed under separate sections.  Section I deals with smokeless tobacco and includes evidence on harmful effects from 105 studies from India and abroad. Section 2 is a compilation of harmful effects of areca nut and includes 93 Indian and International studies.  Altogether 184 scientific articles have been included in this review.  Effort has been made to include all the relevant studies identified from literature search and which met the predefined selection criteria.  The Global Adult Tobacco Survey India (GATS India) is the global standard for systematic monitoring of adult tobacco use (smoking and smokeless) in the country. The survey, conducted in 2009-10 by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) Mumbai, covered about 99.9 % of the total population of India. Its findings revealed that more than one-third (35%) of adults in India used tobacco in some form or the other. Among them, 21 % adults used only smokeless tobacco, 9 % only smoke, and 5 % smoke as well as smokeless tobacco. Based on these, the estimated number of tobacco users in India was 274.9 million, with 163.7 million users of only smokeless tobacco, 68.9 million only smokers, and 42.3 million users of both smoking and smokeless tobacco. The prevalence of overall tobacco use among males was 48 % and among females 20 %, while the use of smokeless tobacco products among males (33%) was higher than among females (18%). The quit ratio for the use of smokeless tobacco use was 5% (Annexure 10).  Studies from different parts of the country have found high prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in the Indian population (Annexure 11 -22). This has been endorsed in the monograph developed by the International Agency for Research in Cancer (lARC) of WHO (Annexure 1 (c).  Many studies have also reported on the prevalence of smokeless tobacco products amongst children and youth of the country (Annexure 1 (c), 23 -38). An annotated bibliography of research on smokeless tobacco in India published by the Human Development Network of the World Bank also provides evidence of its widespread use in India (Annexure 28).”",

It is mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, it is palatable in nature. Secondly, it is cheap and caters to almost all segments of the society especially in the lower strata. He further submitted that the number of users of smokeless tobacco in rural areas is higher than that in urban areas, partly because of the higher prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in rural areas and partly because of the larger rural population. The survey records that the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is 21.4% which is more than twice that of smoking tobacco at 10.7%. Therefore, the estimated number of current adult smokeless tobacco users in India was recorded as 199.4 million i.e., twice that of the current tobacco smokers at 99.5 million. Further, learned senior counsel asserted that according to GATS Survey 2009-10, the total number of smokeless tobacco users in India was 163.7 million as mentioned above, this number had increased to 199.4 million in 2016-17. Relevant part of the report is reproduced hereunder:  Table 4.24 presents prevalence of smokeless tobacco in India by gender and place of residence. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use (21.4%) is more than twice that of smoking (10.7%). Of the 21.4 percent of all adults who use smokeless tobacco, 85 percent (18.2% of all adults) use smokeless tobacco every day, and the remaining 15 percent (3.1% of all adults) use it occasionally. Two percent of the  adults, who were using smokeless tobacco in the past, either daily (1.2%) or occasionally (0.8%), have stopped the use completely. The extent of use of smokeless tobacco among men (29.6%) is higher than among women (12.8%). In rural areas, 24.6 percent adults use smokeless tobacco, whereas in urban areas, 15.2 percent use smokeless tobacco.

Attention was drawn to Chapter 4 of the said report and he emphasized on the health consequences of the usage of smokeless tobacco and the various diseases caused by consuming smokeless tobacco. Relevant part of the report is reproduced hereunder:  “The health risks associated with smokeless tobacco (ST) can vary substantially by product characteristics and ingredients, manner of use, and potential interactions with other tobacco use behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. Based on epidemiologic studies of traditional ST products, such as snuff, chewing tobacco, and betel quid, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (lARC) concluded that these products are carcinogenic to humans and, specifically, that there is sufficient evidence that ST products cause precancerous oral lesions and cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, and pancreas. Additionally, there is sufficient evidence that ST products cause addiction as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity. (lARC defines evidence as sufficient when \"a causal relationship has been established and chance, bias, and confounding could be ruled out with reasonable confidence.\") Given that over 300 million people use ST worldwide, the total burden of ST use is likely to be substantial. Moreover, ST use in some regions appears concurrently with cigarette smoking, thus contributing to the total health burden of tobacco use.”",

Relevant part of Chapter 5 relied upon is reproduced hereunder:  The ST market is different from the cigarette market in several key aspects.  First, the cigarette market offers, in most cases, a relatively homogenized and consistent product within and between countries. A pack of Marlboro cigarettes purchased in Cameroon is similar to a pack of Marlboro cigarettes purchased in Canada or Cambodia. On the other hand, ST purchased in Sweden is very different in terms of ingredients and types of products from ST purchased in India or Sudan.  Second, although cigarettes are a legal product in every nation of the world (except Bhutan), the sale of ST has been effectively banned in nearly 40 countries, most of which are in Europe or the Western Pacific. As a result, and because ST is not widely used in many nations, the consumption of ST is largely concentrated in a few specific regions of the world. Cigarettes, in contrast, are consumed in almost all parts of the world.  Third, ST markets in low-and middle-income countries are not yet dominated by multinational tobacco corporations; the products consumed in those countries are often homemade or manufactured within a fragmented network of small, locally owned businesses. The ST market in many high-income countries, however, has become more highly concentrated, with multinational tobacco corporations owning the largest share. This concentration among  multinationals has implications for tobacco surveillance, the regulatory environment, and economies of scale. Fourth, ST markets are much less regulated than cigarette markets, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, and this lack of regulation affects tax levels and the effectiveness of collecting taxes on smokeless tobacco.”",

                        "content": "Learned senior counsel further referred to Chapter 13 of the above-mentioned report titled “Smokeless Tobacco use in the South-East Asia Region” and described the wide variety of smokeless tobacco products that are made and used in this region. Relevant part of Chapter 13 relied upon is reproduced hereunder:  “Types of Products and Patterns of Use This chapter will first describe the wide variety of smokeless tobacco (ST) products that are made and used in this region. Various ST products are chewed, sucked (dipped), applied to the gums and teeth, snuffed, or gargled. Products may be as simple and inexpensive as unmanufactured, loose flakes of tobacco leaves that are sold by weight and may be chewed with only slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) paste, or as complex as a paste made from boiled tobacco and spice flavorings (e.g., kiwam) and sold in small glass bottles. A common way of consuming chewing tobacco in the region is as an ingredient in betel quid. Use of betel quid is an ancient practice. Tobacco was added as an ingredient in the quid beginning around 1600, and it is now used in betel quid in many parts of South-East Asia. Betel quid is composed of pieces of areca nuts (from the Areca catechu palm), betel leaf from the Piper betle L. (Piperaceae) vine, aqueous slaked lime paste (calcium hydroxide, made from roasted limestone or seashells), and other minor ingredients such as catechu (for astringency), cardamom, and clove, according to the taste of the user. Some of these components are agricultural products (e.g., betel leaf, areca nut), and others are simple ingredients that could be cottage industry products (e.g., slaked lime). They are combined by Vendors  and users and made into fresh betel quids for immediate consumption. Historically, betel quid has been incorrectly believed to have beneficial medicinal properties. The user who incorporates tobacco into it may not consider tobacco a harmful addition.  Smokeless tobacco products of different kinds with different names are often incorporated into betel quid, although some are also-used separately. The most common type of tobacco incorporated into betel quid is plain tobacco flakes (also called sada pata); sometimes flavored tobacco flakes such as zarda or khaini may be added. Snuff-type products, which tend to be applied to gums or teeth rather than chewed, are not used with betel quid. Although areca nut itself is mildly addictive, a betel quid user may not understand the much higher addictive potential of tobacco in the quid.  In India, some products have been manufactured on an industrial scale since 1975. These commercially produced ST products, such as pan masala and gutka, are modeled after betel quid and contain many of the same ingredients but in a dried form and without fresh betel leaf. The manufactured products were designed to be easily carried and consumed anywhere at any time, unlike betel quid, which is highly perishable and inconvenient to carry because of its high moisture content. In addition to being dried and packaged in single-use doses, these manufactured products contain preservatives to lengthen their shelf life. They may also contain other ingredients, such as small pieces of areca nut, calcium hydroxide, catechu, sweeteners, perfumes, tobacco flakes and/or powder, and flavorings such as menthol, cardamom, and clove. Gutka always contains tobacco, but most brands of pan masala do not. Gutka and pan masala products frequently carry the same brand names, allowing manufacturers to circumvent laws banning tobacco advertisements since they are able to advertise a product that appears identical to tobacco-containing gutka.”",

In this regard, he referred to the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in State of Bombay v. Virkumar Gulabchand Shah, reported as AIR 1952 SC 335 wherein the issue before the Apex Court was whether turmeric is a “foodstuff” within the meaning of clause 3 of the Spices (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order, 1944 read with Section 2(a) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946). Learned senior counsel referred to Para 12 thereof and submitted that, whether “food” has to be interpreted narrowly or strictly, will depend on the facts and circumstances and context. Further, he submitted that the Hon‟ble Court noted with approval of the decision in James v. Jones of the Queen‟s Bench, which held Baking Powder to be an article of food within the meaning of English Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 and thus expanded the definition of food to include not only foodstuffs strictly so called but also ingredients which go into their preparation to ensure that the object  of the legislation which was to conserve the health of people was not defeated. Further, he referred that the Hon‟ble Court also referred to a narrower view which was taken by the King‟s Bench in Hinde v. Allmond with regard to tea. In the context of the Food Hoarding Order of 2017, the Judges deliberately took a narrower view of the word \"food\" to exclude tea from the ambit of the order to prevent the prosecution of a housewife for hoarding a quantity of tea which exceeded the quantity required for ordinary use and consumption in her household. The Hon‟ble Court noted that a diametrically opposite view was taken in a later decision, Sainsbury v. Saunders where the Court concluded that tea indeed was food in the context of the Defence of the Realm Regulations for regulating the food-supply of country. He further submitted that the Hon‟ble Court held turmeric to be a foodstuff within the meaning of the Regulations. However, it unequivocally held that the meaning of \"food\" and \"foodstuff\" would have to be interpreted in the background and context of the issue before the Court.",

The Hon‟ble Court, in Para 14 of the judgment, held that the definition was wide enough to include all articles that are eaten by men for nourishment or taste and it takes in subsidiaries. In this context, it was held that supari, which was eaten with  relish by men for taste, was food. In consonance with the law laid down in Virkumar Gulabchand Shah (supra), the Court held that the meaning of common words, presumably food, should be understood in a commonsense way. The Hon‟ble Court further rejected the challenge to the ban on cyclamates and held that it would defer to legislative wisdom when the question pertained to the lives of millions of Indians who are, by-and-large, less aware and health conscious than people in other parts of the world.",

The issue before the Hon‟ble Court was whether “gingerly oil” allegedly being sold for external application only could be considered as “food” within the meaning of the PFA. The Hon‟ble Court went beyond the test in Pyarali K. Tejani (supra) and held that the intention of the manufacturer was irrelevant for the purpose of including an article within the definition of food. The Court held that it was not necessary that the article was intended for human consumption or preparation of human food. However, it was enough if the article was generally or commonly used for human consumption. The Court‟s view was guided by the social reality of the country in which the vast number of people living beneath ordinary subsistence level are ready to consume that which may otherwise be thought as not fit for human consumption or intended for it. In this context, the Court held that, ―in order to be food for the purposes of the act, an article need not be ―fit‖ for human consumption; it need not be even described or exhibited as intended for human consumption; it may be otherwise described or exhibited; it need not be even necessarily  intended for human consumption; it is enough if it is generally or commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of human food‖. Learned counsel therefore submitted that even in the regime existing prior to the FSSA, Courts in India liberally and expansively interpreted the definition of “food” in order to protect people against consumption of harmful substances and articles. He further submitted that the test laid down in Pyarali K. Tejani (supra) was reiterated by the Court in the Krishna Gopal Sharma & Anr. v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi, reported as (1996) 4 SCC 513, where the Court held that pan masala and mouth freshener are undoubtedly within the definition of “food” under the PFA.

The endeavour of the Respondents, by way of the impugned Notifications, is to prevent the sale of chewing tobacco, which is either flavoured or scented in order to  ensure that it is not available in pre-mixed form for mixing with pan masala sold separately in order to defeat the ban imposed under Regulation 2.3.4.

The Court further held that ―intended for human consumption‖ does not necessarily include only those items which enter the digestive system therefore even though Gutka which according to the Court is chewed for some time and then thrown out and does not enter the digestive system, would also constitute “food” within the meaning of the FSSA. The Court also relied on the fact that Gutka and Pan Masala were not specifically excluded from the definition of “food” under the FSSA in the exclusionary clause under Section 3(1)(j). It was therefore submitted by the learned counsel that the interpretation accorded to Gutka and Pan Masala would apply to chewing tobacco with equal force because chewing tobacco is also consumed often with additives such as sweeteners and fragrances without entering the digestive system and would therefore fall under the definition of “food” as interpreted by the High Court of Bombay.",

We now proceed to consider the bold bid made by the appellant to convince the Court that supari is not an article of food and, as such, the admixture of any sweetener cannot attract the penal provisions at all. He who runs and reads the definition in Section 2(v) of the Act will answer back that supari is food. The lexicographic learning, pharma-copic erudition, the ancient medical literature and extracts of encyclopaedias pressed before us with great industry are worthy of a more substantial submission. Indeed, learned counsel treated us to an extensive study to make out that supari was not a food but a drug. He explained the botany of betelnut, drew our attention to Dr. Nandkarni's Indian Materia Medica, invited us to the great Susruta's reference to this aromatic stimulant in a valiant endeavour to persuade us to hold that supari was more medicinal than edible. We are here concerned with a law regulating adulteration of food which effects the common people in their millions and their health. We are dealing with a commodity which is consumed by the ordinary man in houses, hotels, marriage parties and even routinely. In the field of legal interpretation, dictionary scholarship and precedent-based connotations cannot become a universal guide or semantic tyrant, oblivious of the social context, subject of legislation and object of the law. The meaning of common words relating to common articles consumed by the common people, available commonly and contained in a statute intended to protect the community generally, must be gathered from the common sense understanding of the word. The Act defines 'food' very widely as covering any article used as food and every component which enters into it, and even flavouring matter and condiments. It is commonplace knowledge that the word \"food\" is a very general term and applies to all that is eaten by man for  nourishment and takes in subsidiaries. Is supari eaten with relish by man for taste and nourishment? It is. And so it is food. Without carrying further on this unusual argument we hold that supari is food within the meaning of Section 2(v) of the Act.”",

Krishnamurthy (supra) was dealing with the issue whether “gingerly oil” allegedly being sold for external application only could be considered as “food” within the meaning of the PFA. The Hon‟ble Court held that it was not necessary that the article was intended for human consumption or preparation of human food. However, it was enough if the article was generally or commonly used for human consumption. The Hon‟ble Apex Court held as follows:  “7. According to the definition of \"food\" which we have extracted above, for the purposes of the Act, any article used as food or drink for human consumption and any article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food is \"food\". It is not necessary that it is intended for human consumption or for preparation of human food. It is also irrelevant that it is described or exhibited as intended for some other use. It is enough if the article is generally or commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of human food. It is notorious that there are, unfortunately, in our vast country, large segments of population, who, living as they do, far beneath ordinary subsistence level, are ready to consume that which may otherwise be thought as not fit for human consumption. In order to keep body and soul together, they are often tempted to buy and use as food, articles which are adulterated and even unfit for human consumption but which are sold at inviting prices, under the pretence or without pretence that they are intended to be used for purposes other than human consumption. It is to prevent the exploitation and self-destruction of these poor,  ignorant and illiterate persons that the definition of \"food\" is couched in such terms as not to take into account whether an article is intended for human consumption or not. In order to be \"food\" for the purposes of the Act, an article need not be \"fit\" for human consumption; it need not be described or exhibited as intended for human consumption; it may even be otherwise described or exhibited; it need not even be necessarily intended for human consumption; it is enough if it is generally or commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of human food. Where an article is generally or commonly not used for human consumption or in the preparation of human food but for some other purpose, notwithstanding that it may be capable of being used, on rare occasions, for human consumption or in the preparation of human food, it may be said, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, that it is not \"food\". In such a case the question whether it is intended for human consumption or in the preparation of human food may become material. But where the article is one which is generally or commonly used for human consumption or in the preparation of human food, there can be no question but that the article is \"food\". Gingelly oil, mixed or not with groundnut oil or some other oil, whether described or exhibited as an article of food for human consumption or as an article for external use only is \"food\" within the meaning of the definition contained in Section 2(v) of the Act.‖",

In the first place, this judgment arises under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, read with the Tamil Nadu Scheduled Articles (Prescription of Standards) Order, 1977 and the notification dated 9th June, 1978, issued by the Central Government which laid down certain specifications \"in relation to foodstuffs\". The question that arose before the Court was whether tea is 'foodstuff' within the meaning of the said legislation. The division bench of this Court came to the conclusion that 'tea' is not food as it is not understood as 'food' or 'foodstuff' either in common parlance or by the opinion of lexicographers. We are unable to derive much help from this judgment for the reason that we are not  concerned with tea. It is not possible to extrapolate the reasoning of this judgment pertaining to tea into the realm of pan masala and gutka.

While examining the validity of the said Notifications, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that Section 7(iv) of the PFA is not an independent source of power for the State Authorities. The power under Section 7(iv) is transitory in nature and can be exercised only during local emergencies. The relevant portions of the said judgment, inter alia, reads as follows:  “47. We find it difficult to agree with the submissions of Mr. Lalit. That all provisions of a statute have to be read harmoniously and any interpretation as to be ex visceribus actus, is a trite doctrine of construction of statutes. Undoubtedly, if Section 7(iv) is read in isolation, it gives the impression that this is an independent source of power, not subject to any limitation other than the guideline \"in the interest of public health\". But, when the scheme of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is analysed in the light of its preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it becomes clear that there is no independent source of power under Section 7(iv). Had it been so, there was no need for the rule making power of the State Government under Section 24(2)(a) to define the powers and duties of the Food (Health) Authority or local authority and Local (Health) Authority under the Act. The interplay of sections 23(1A)(f) and 24(2)(a) read with the existing rules in the different states, even after the amendment of Section 7(iv) by the Act 49 of 1964, leads us to conclude that the contention of the states in this regard cannot be accepted.”",

According to the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, the collocation of the words in the impugned Notification suggests  not a matter of policy, but a matter of implementation of policy. According to the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, a decision for banning an article of food or an article containing any ingredient of food injurious to health can only arise as a result of broadly considered policy. If such a power be conceded in favour of a local authority like the Food (Health) Authority, paradoxical results would arise. The same article could be considered injurious to public health in one local area, but not in another. Hence, the Hon‟ble Apex Court opined that „the construction of the provisions of the statute must not be such as to result in such absurd or paradoxical consequences‟.",

Cynamide India Ltd. and Anr. (vide para 7) where this Court observed thus:  \"7.The third observation we wish to make is, price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative activity than any other. It is true that, with the proliferation of delegated legislation, there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion. Administrative, quasi-judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and, conversely, legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi-judicial activity. Any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions, it has been said, is 'difficult in theory and impossible in practice'. Though difficult, it is necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different legal rights and consequences may ensue. The distinction between the two has usually been expressed as 'one between the general and the particular'.  'A legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases; an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy'. 'Legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future; administration is the process of performing particular acts, of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases'. It has also been said: 'Rule-making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class' while, 'adjudication, on the other hand, applies to specific individuals or situations'. But, this is only a broad distinction, not necessarily always true. Administration and administrative adjudication may also be of general application and there may be legislation of particular application only. That is not ruled out. Again, adjudication determines past and present facts and declares rights and liabilities while legislation indicates the future course of action. Adjudication is determinative of the past and the present while legislation is indicative of the future. The object of the rule, the reach of its application, the rights and obligations arising out of it, its intended effect on past, present and future events, its form, the manner of its promulgation are some factors which may help in drawing the line between legislative and non-legislative acts.\"",

(vide para17), this Court after referring to the aforesaid observations of Chinnappa Reddy, J. in Cynamide (supra),  observed that even when exercising a legislative function, the delegate may in a given case be required to consider the view point which may be likely to be affected by the exercise of power. This Court pointed out that conditional legislation can be broadly classified into three categories: (1) when the legislature has completed its task of enacting a statute, the entire superstructure of the legislation is ready but its future applicability to a given area is left to the subjective satisfaction of the delegate (as in Tulsipur Sugar Co. case ); (2) where the delegate has to decide whether and under what circumstances a legislation which has already come into force is to be partially withdrawn from operation in a given area or in given cases so as not to be applicable to a given class of persons who are otherwise admittedly governed by the Act; (3) where the exercise of conditional legislation would depend upon satisfaction of the delegate on objective facts placed by one class of persons seeking benefit of such an exercise with a view to deprive the rival class of persons who otherwise might have already got statutory benefits under the Act and who are likely to lose the existing benefit because of exercise of such a power by the delegate. This Court emphasised that in the third type of cases the satisfaction of the delegate must necessarily be based on objective considerations and, irrespective of whether the exercise of such power is judicial or quasi-judicial function, still it has to be treated to be one which requires objective consideration of relevant factual data pressed into service by one side, which could be rebutted by the other side, who would be adversely affected if such exercise of power is undertaken by the delegate.",

While rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for interim relief, the Bombay High Court prima facie opined that:  (a)  The definition of “food” used in FSSA is much wider than the definition of food just as chewing gum may be kept in the mouth for some time and thereafter thrown out. Similarly, Gutka containing tobacco may be chewed for some time and then thrown out. Even if it does not enter into the digestive system, it would be covered by the definition of “food”. Further, the Hon‟ble Court observed that even while holding the COTPA to be a special Act, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court did not accept the contention of the petitioners that the PFA had no role to play in the matter of regulation of manufacture and sale of Gutka and Pan Masala. In fact, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that tobacco and tobacco products will come under the ambit of “food” for the purpose of the FSSA.  (b)  Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA conferring power to ban Gutka or Pan Masala under the PFA was vested in the Central Government under Section 23(1A)(f) of PFA and not in the State Government under Section 7(iv) thereof. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court thus did not accept the petitioners' contention in Godawat Pan Masala (supra) that the COTPA was the only legislation occupying the field of tobacco and tobacco products and that the PFA had nothing to do with any tobacco product. Furthermore, the Hon‟ble Court held that the power conferred on the  Food Safety Commissioner of the State is not similar to the power of the State Government under Section 7(iv) of the PFA.  (c)  Section 30(2)(a) confers independent power on the Food Safety Commissioner of the State.  (d)  FSSA is a later Act and a comprehensive legislation on food safety and contains a non-obstante clause in Section 89 thereof, in the field of safety and standards of food (which includes gutka, pan masala and supari) and thus, the FSSA occupies the entire field.  (e)  The Commissioner of Food Safety, Maharashtra exercising his powers under Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA, is a delegate of Parliament.  (f)  When action based on experts' report is taken by a delegate of Parliament, it should not in the normal course, be disturbed.  (g)  There is an obligation on the food business operator under Section 26(2)(i) of the FSSA not to manufacture or sale any food which is unsafe. Hence, if there is any violation of the said Section, the Commissioner of Food Safety has the power to issue a quasi-legislative order under Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA. Thus, the Commissioner of Food Safety need not follow the principles of natural justice before the issuance of order under Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA.",

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, reported as 2016 SCC OnLine Pat 9231, dealt with the challenge of the orders issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety, Patna whereby the Commissioner, in exercise of powers, under Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA, had prohibited the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of Zarda, Pan Masala and Gutka. There was also a challenge to the vires of Regulation 2.11.5 of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards Food Additives) Regulation, 2011, whereby Pan Masala (not Zarda) has been included as an item of food and the standards for the same have been prescribed and separate provisions for their packaging and labeling have been made. While dealing with the issue, the Hon‟ble Division Bench of the Patna High Court held as follows:  (a)  When the preamble to FSSA states that science-based standardization would be adopted in laying down standards of food, the Commissioner, while exercising powers under Section 30 of the FSSA, must be in possession of objective materials that the food, sought to be prohibited, does not conform to the standards as prescribed by the Regulations.  (b)  Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA has to be understood in the light of Section 34. As a result, a prohibition order can be issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety only when a report is laid down by the Designated Officer that the health risk condition exists with respect to any food business.  (c)  A prohibition order cannot, therefore, be made a permanent order and/or be made to run for years together defeating thereby the legislative  will, which warrants the executive to exercise its power under Section 30 of the FSSA in emergent circumstances.  (d)  Before passing of the order, there must be emergent circumstances based on objective materials that in the interest of public health, the manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of any article of food, either in the whole of the State or any area or part thereof, be prohibited.  (e)  The tenure of the prohibitory order has to be temporary in nature and must not exceed 1 (one) year in its entirety; now, any extension of the prohibitory order would amount to virtually and effectively making a legislation by the executive fiat.  (f)  The principle of audi alteram partem applies in exercise of powers under Section 30(2)(a) and the aggrieved persons should be heard before continuing with the prohibition order.  (g)  Since the prohibition is with reference to a food business operator, the prohibition must indicate the name of food business operator and also the brand name, if any, under which the food business is being carried out.  (h)  The provisions of Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA are referable to Section 7(iv) of the PFA (since repealed) and, hence, the powers are transitory in nature and intended to deal with emergent circumstances for a short period, while such emergency lasts.  (i)  The Commissioner of Food Safety has been issuing Notifications from time to time exceeding the period of 1 (one) year, which amounts to an act of legislation, a power not vested in the Commissioner of Food  Safety. The power conferred by Section 30 of the FSSA upon the Commissioner of Food Safety, cannot be used on a permanent basis or else, it would amount to doing of an act or prohibiting an act by resorting to executive fiat and not by legislative act.  (j)  The COTPA, being a parent legislation, is the comprehensive law, which deals with the sale, manufacture and production of tobacco and tobacco products notified in the Schedule of the COTPA, whereas the FSSA is exclusive law, which deals with foods other than tobacco.  (k)  Regulation 2.3.4, which prohibits use of tobacco and nicotine with respect to scheduled tobacco and tobacco products under the COTPA, must yield to the COTPA.  (l)  The order of the Commissioner of the Food Safety, in so far as it prohibits the use of tobacco and nicotine with respect to scheduled tobacco products under the COTPA, is not only arbitrarily but is also beyond the scope of powers conferred by the FSSA.",

The Hon‟ble High Court, while quashing the aforementioned legislation, held that COTPA is a comprehensive piece of legislation on all tobacco products including cigarettes, chewing tobacco, pan masala, gutka, etc. In other words, this Act covers both smoking tobacco and chewing tobacco. The Hon‟ble Court held that not only the Assam Legislative Assembly lacked legislative competence to have enacted the Assam Health (Prohibition of Manufacturing, Advertisement, Trade, Storage, Distribution, Sale and Consumption of Zarda, Gutka, Pan Masala etc., containing Tobacco and/or Nicotine) Act 2013 but the said Act also suffers from the vice of repugnancy vis-à-vis the Central Act, namely, the COTPA and therefore cannot be sustained. Furthermore, it also held that unlike intoxicating drinks, trade and commerce in tobacco cannot be said to be res extra commercium.",

                        "content": "The learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in the matter of Sanjay Anjay Stores and Ors. v. Union of India, reported as 2017 SCC OnLine Cal 16323 was dealing with a petition, where the petitioners prayed that they are producers within the meaning of Section 3(k) of the COTPA and are outside the purview of the FSSA and Regulation 2.3.4. Further, the petitioners also challenged a Notification issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety, West Bengal, prohibiting zarda, khaini and  all tobacco products in the State of West Bengal, in exercise of its powers under Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA read with Regulation 2.3.4. The main questions before the Hon‟ble Court were whether the said products are “food” within the meaning of the FSSA and secondly, whether the FSSA would apply to such products or the COTPA would apply for regulating the manufacturing, storage, distribution and sale of such products. The Hon‟ble Calcutta High Court held that the above-mentioned items are not “food” within the meaning of the FSSA as tobacco products provide stimulant which is more psychological rather than real. Further, the Hon‟ble Court held that on the strength of a delegated legislation in the form of the Regulations framed under the FSSA, the authorities cannot seek to prohibit trade and commerce in the said products. That would amount to an exercise of a power which they do not have. Furthermore, the Hon‟ble Court held that the COTPA is a comprehensive legislation to regulate trade and commerce in tobacco products. The FSSA, no doubt is a subsequent legislation. Section 97(1) of the FSSA provides that the statues specified in the Second Schedule to the FSSA shall stand repealed, which does not include the COTPA. Hence, the COTPA remains an effective piece of legislation in its own field, not being touched by FSSA. The Hon‟ble Court further held that the provisions of the COTPA would override the provisions of the FSSA. The relevant portions from the aforesaid judgment are reproduced herein below:  “(39) If it is assumed that tobacco is food within the meaning of FSSA then there must be a science based standard for tobacco to regulate manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import of tobacco products to ensure availability of safe and wholesome tobacco for human  consumption. Unless such standards can be laid down, tobacco cannot be termed as food. Obviously such standards cannot be laid down. Consumption of tobacco and tobacco products are universally acknowledged as injurious to human health and that is why COTPA has been promulgated to regulate trade and commerce in tobacco and tobacco products. Such products cannot, in my opinion, be considered as food by any stretch of imagination……  (40)  ………….Hence, in my opinion, in spite of the expansive definition of 'food' in Section 3(j) of FSSA, tobacco and tobacco products cannot be said to be within the purview of the said Act.  (41)  Even if for the sake of argument I were to hold that the said products come within the definition of food as provided in the FSSA, I would still hold that the Commissioner of Food Safety has no jurisdiction to issue notifications like the one under challenge in the present writ applications, for the following reasons:  (42)  FSSA is a regulatory statute. It empowers the authority to regulate the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import of food products for human consumption. Such regulatory power does not authorize the authorities to prohibit the manufacture, etc. of tobacco or tobacco products even if the same can be called 'food'. Trade in tobacco is not impermissible in India. In Godawat Pan Masala (supra) the Apex Court held that tobacco or tobacco products are not res extra commercium. If consumption of tobacco or products containing tobacco or nicotine was considered to be so inherently dangerous for human health, the Parliament could have banned altogether trade and commerce in tobacco and tobacco products even in the face of Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. But the Parliament did not do so. It has instead chosen to regulate rather than prohibit trade and commerce in tobacco and tobacco products by promulgating COTPA. Hence, on the strength of a delegated legislation in the form of FSS Regulations framed under the FSSA, the authorities cannot  seek to prohibit trade and commerce in the said products. That would be an exercise of a power that they do not have. (43) In view of my considered opinion that the said products are not food within the meaning of FSSA, according to me there is no conflict between the FSSA and COTPA. The two statutes operate in different fields and there is no repugnancy between them. The conflict is between the COTPA and the FSS Regulations. It is trite law and I need not cite any authority for it that if there is a conflict between a central legislation and a delegated legislation, the later must yield to the former.  (44)  As I see it, the FSSA has been enacted to ensure minimum standard of food for human consumption in the interest of public health and the COTPA has been promulgated to regulate the trade and commerce in tobacco and tobacco products also in the interest of public health. There is no overlapping and hence no repugnancy or conflict between the two enactments. Reasonable restrictions may be imposed on the trade and commerce in tobacco and allied products under the COTPA but the Commissioner of Food Safety has no jurisdiction to impose any such restriction or prohibition under the FSSA.  (45)  I am not for a moment suggesting that consumption of tobacco or tobacco products is not injurious to public health. However, I am of the firm opinion that the Commissioner of Food Safety or any other authority does not have the power or jurisdiction under the FSS Regulations or the FSSA to prohibit the trade and commerce in the said products. Restriction may be imposed on the trade and commerce of the said products only to the extent permitted under the COTPA.”",

In Godawat Pan Masala (supra), the Hon‟ble Supreme Court further held that COTPA is a special Act intended to deal with tobacco and tobacco products and hence it will override Section 7(iv) of the PFA. The relevant portion, inter alia, reads as follows:  “The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 are directly in conflict with the provisions of Section 7(iv) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The former Act is a special Act intended to deal with tobacco and tobacco products particularly, while the latter enactment is a general enactment. Thus, the Act 34 of 2003 being a special Act, and of later origin, overrides the provisions of Section 7(iv) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 with regard to the power to prohibit the sale or manufacture of tobacco products which are listed in the Schedule to the Act 34 of 2003”",

Merely licensing regulation, duties and taxes have been imposed on tobacco products. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court further examined whether tobacco can be treated as „res extra commercium‟, and held as under:  “53. Is the consumption of pan masala or gutka (containing tobacco), or for that matter tobacco itself, considered so inherently or viciously dangerous to health, and, if so, is there any legislative policy to totally ban its use in the country? In the face of Act 34 of 2003, the answer must be in the negative. It is difficult to accept the contention that the substance banned by the impugned notification is treated as res extra commercium. In the first place, the gamut of legislation enacted in this country which deals with tobacco does not suggest that Parliament has ever treated it as an article res extra commercium, nor has Parliament attempted to ban its use absolutely. The Industries (Development and Regulations) Act, 1951 merely imposed licensing regulation on tobacco products under item 38(1) of the First Schedule. The Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 in Section 14(ix) prescribes the rates for Central Sales Tax. Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 prescribes the additional duty leviable on tobacco products. The Tobacco Board Act, 1975 established a Tobacco Board for development of tobacco industries in the country. Even the latest Act, i.e. the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, does not ban the sale of tobacco products listed in the Schedule except to minors. Further, we find that in the tariff schedule of the Central Sales Tax Act, there are several entries which deal with tobacco and also pan masala. In the face of these legislative measures seeking to levy restrictions and control the manufacture and sale of tobacco and its allied products as well as pan masala, it is not possible to accept that the  article itself has been treated as res extra commercium. The legislative policy, if any, seems to be to the contrary. In any event, whether an article is to be prohibited as res extra commercium is a matter of legislative policy and must arise out of an Act of legislature and not by a mere notification issued by an executive authority.”",

Bombay Municipal Corporation, reported in (1985) 3 SCC 545, a Constitution Bench of Supreme Court had the occasion to deal with the provisions of Section 314 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888. It was held by the Supreme Court that Section 314 confers on the Commissioner the discretion to cause an encroachment to be removed with or without notice. That discretion has to be exercised in a reasonable manner so as to comply with the constitutional mandate that the procedure, accompanying the performance of a public act, must be fair and reasonable. The Court must lean in favour of this interpretation, because it helps sustain the validity of the law. It was further held, in Olga Tellis (supra), that it must further be presumed that, while vesting the Commissioner with the power to act without notice, the Legislature intended that the power should be exercised sparingly and, in cases of urgency, which brook no delay. In all other cases, no departure from the audi alteram partem rule could be presumed to have been intended. On the provisions of Section 314, the Supreme Court held, in Olga Tellis (supra), that it is so designed as to exclude the principles of natural justice by way of exception and not as a general rule. There are situations, which demand the exclusion of the rules of natural justice by reason of diverse factors like time, place, the apprehended danger and so on. The ordinary rule, which regulates all procedure, is that persons, who are likely to be affected by the proposed action, must be afforded an opportunity of being heard as to why that action should not be taken. The hearing may be  given individually or collectively depending upon the facts of each situation. A departure from this fundamental rule of natural justice may be presumed to have been intended by the Legislature only in circumstances, which warrant it.

(b)  The COTPA is a comprehensive legislation dealing with the sale and distribution of scheduled tobacco products and therefore, occupies the entire field relating to tobacco products. Therefore, the COTPA, being a  special law, occupies the entire field for tobacco and tobacco products and would prevail over the FSSA which is a general law.  (c)  It has never been the intention of the Parliament to impose an absolute ban on manufacture, sale, distribution and storage of tobacco and/or tobacco products. However, the intention of the Parliament is to regulate the trade and commerce of tobacco and tobacco products in accordance with the COTPA, a Central Act which deals with tobacco industry.  (d)  The doctrine of implied repeal has no application to the present case as the FSSA and the COTPA occupy different fields i.e., the former applies to the “food industry” while the latter applies to the “tobacco industry”. Therefore, the FSSA does not impliedly repeal the provisions of the COTPA.  (e)  Tobacco cannot be construed as “food” within the meaning of the provisions of FSSA.  (f)  Section 30(2)(a) of the FSSA has to be read in consonance with Section 18 of the FSSA. The power under Section 30(2)(a) is transitory in nature and the Commissioner of Food Safety can issue prohibition orders only in emergent circumstances after giving an opportunity of being heard to the concerned food operator(s). The impugned Notifications, however, have been issued by Respondent No.1 year after year in a mechanical manner without following the general principles laid down under Section 18 and 30(2)(a) of the FSSA, which is a clear abuse of the powers conferred upon him under the FSSA.
