(3)  Where the Registrar finds nothing in the particulars of an international registration to refuse grant of protection under sub-section (2), he shall within the prescribed period cause such international registration to be advertised in the prescribed manner.  (4)  The provisions of sections 9 to 21 (both inclusive), 63 and 74 shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to an international registration as if such international registration was an application for registration of a trade mark under section 18.  (5)  When the protection of an international registration has not been opposed and the time for notice of opposition has expired, the Registrar shall within a period of eighteen months of the receipt of advice under sub-section (1) notify the International Bureau its acceptance of extension of protection of the trade mark under such international registration and, in case the Registrar fails to notify the International Bureau, it shall be deemed that the protection has been extended to the trade mark.  (6)  Where a registered proprietor of a trade mark makes an international registration of that trade mark and designates India, the international registration from the date of the registration shall be deemed to replace the registration held in India without prejudice to any right acquired under such previously held registration and the Registrar shall, upon request by the applicant, make necessary entry in the register referred to in sub-section (1) of section 6.  (7)  A holder of international registration of a trade mark who designates India and who has not been extended protection in India shall have the same remedy which is available to any person making an application for the registration of a trade mark under section 18 and which has not resulted in registration under section 23.  (8) Where at any time before the expiry of a period of five years of an international registration, whether such registration has been transferred to another person or not, the related basic application or, as the case may be, the basic registration in a Contracting Party other than India has been withdrawn or cancelled or has expired or has been finally refused in respect of all or some of the goods or services listed in the international registration, the protection resulting from such international registration in India shall cease to have effect.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

The relevant provisions of the Madrid Protocol so far as are relevant to the present Petitions, are reproduced hereinbelow:- “Article 4  Effects of International Registration  (1)  (a) From the date of the registration or recordal effected in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 3ter, the protection of the mark in each of the Contracting Parties concerned shall be the same as if the mark had been deposited direct with the Office of that Contracting Party. If no refusal has been notified to the International Bureau in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) or if a refusal notified in accordance with the said Article has been withdrawn subsequently, the protection of the mark in the Contracting Party concerned shall, as from the said date, be the same as if the mark had been registered by the Office of that Contracting Party.  (b)  The indication of classes of goods and services provided for in Article 3 shall not bind the Contracting Parties with regard to the determination of the scope of the protection of the mark.  (2)  Every international registration shall enjoy the right of priority provided for by Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, without it being necessary to  comply with the formalities prescribed in Section D of that Article.  Article 4bis  Replacement of a National or Regional Registration by an International Registration  (1)  Where a mark that is the subject of a national or regional registration in the Office of a Contracting Party is also the subject of an international registration and both registrations stand in the name of the same person, the international registration is deemed to replace the national or regional registration, without prejudice to any rights acquired by virtue of the latter, provided that  (i)  the protection resulting from the international registration extends to the said Contracting Party under Article 3ter(1) or (2),  (ii)  all the goods and services listed in the national or regional registration are also listed in the international registration in respect of the said Contracting Party,  (iii)  such extension takes effect after the date of the national or regional registration.  (2)  The Office referred to in paragraph (1) shall, upon request, be required to take note in its register of the international registration.  Article 5  Refusal and Invalidation of Effects of International Registration in Respect of Certain Contracting Parties  (1)  Where the applicable legislation so authorizes, any Office of a Contracting Party which has been notified by the International Bureau of an extension to that Contracting Party, under Article 3ter(1) or (2), of the protection resulting from the international registration shall have the right to declare in a notification of refusal that protection cannot be granted in the  said Contracting Party to the mark which is the subject of such extension. Any such refusal can be based only on the grounds which would apply, under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in the case of a mark deposited direct with the Office which notifies the refusal. However, protection may not be refused, even partially, by reason only that the applicable legislation would permit registration only in a limited number of classes or for a limited number of goods or services.  (2)     (a) Any Office wishing to exercise such right shall notify its refusal to the International Bureau, together with a statement of all grounds, within the period prescribed by the law applicable to that Office and at the latest, subject to subparagraphs (b) and (c), before the expiry of one year from the date on which the notification of the extension referred to in paragraph (1) has been sent to that Office by the International Bureau.  (b)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any Contracting Party may declare that, for international registrations made under this Protocol, the time limit of one year referred to in subparagraph (a) is replaced by 18 months.  (c)  Such declaration may also specify that, when a refusal of protection may result from an opposition to the granting of protection, such refusal may be notified by the Office of the said Contracting Party to the International Bureau after the expiry of the 18 month time limit. Such an Office may, with respect to any given international registration, notify a refusal of protection after the expiry of the 18-month time limit, but only if  (i)  it has, before the expiry of the 18-month time limit, informed the International Bureau of the possibility that oppositions may  be filed after the expiry of the 18-month time limit and  (ii) the notification of the refusal based on an opposition is made within a time limit of one month from the expiry of the opposition period and, in any case, not later than seven months from the date on which the opposition period begins.  (d)  Any declaration under subparagraphs (b) or (c) may be made in the instruments referred to in Article 14(2), and the effective date of the declaration shall be the same as the date of entry into force of this Protocol with respect to the State or intergovernmental organization having made the declaration. Any such declaration may also be made later, in which case the declaration shall have effect three months after its receipt by the Director General of the Organization (hereinafter referred to as \"the Director General\"), or at any later date indicated in the declaration, in respect of any international registration whose date is the same as or is later than the effective date of the declaration.  (e)  Upon the expiry of a period of ten years from the entry into force of this Protocol, the Assembly shall examine the operation of the system established by subparagraphs (a) to (d). Thereafter, the provisions of the said subparagraphs may be modified by a unanimous decision of the Assembly.  (3)  The International Bureau shall, without delay, transmit one of the copies of the notification of refusal to the holder of the international registration. The said holder shall have the same remedies as if the mark had been deposited by him direct with the Office which has notified its refusal. Where the International Bureau has received information under paragraph (2)(c)(i), it shall, without delay, transmit the said information to the holder of the international registration.  (4)  The grounds for refusing a mark shall be communicated by the International Bureau to any interested party who may so request.  (5)  Any Office which has not notified, with respect to a given international registration, any provisional or final refusal to the International Bureau in accordance with paragraphs (1) and  (2)  shall, with respect to that international registration, lose the benefit of the right provided for in paragraph (1).  (6)  Invalidation, by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party, of the effects, in the territory of that Contracting Party, of an international registration may not be pronounced without the holder of such international registration having, in good time, been afforded the opportunity of defending his rights. Invalidation shall be notified to the International Bureau.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Article 4(1)(a) and 5(5) further states that failure of the office of the Contracting Party to notify its provisional or final „refusal‟ to a given international registration shall result in such Contracting Party losing its right to such refusal and the protection of the mark in question shall extend to such Contracting Party.",

While in Madrid Protocol, it is failure to communicate „refusal‟ within the time prescribed, which shall result in deemed extension of protection to the Trade Mark, in Section 36E(5) of the Act, it is the failure to convey „acceptance‟ that leads to such deeming extension of protection.",

Now, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 36, p. 414, there is a presumption that Parliament does not assert or assume jurisdiction which goes beyond the limits established by the common consent of nations and statutes are to be interpreted provided that their language permits, so as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations or with the established principles of International law.

In this country, as is the case in England, the treaty or International Protocol or convention does not become effective or operative of its own force as in some of the continental countries unless domestic legislation has been introduced to attain a specified result. Once, Parliament has legislated, the Court must first look at the legislation and construe the language employed in it. If the terms of the legislative enactment do not suffer from any ambiguity or lack of clarity they must be given effect to even if they do not carry out the treaty obligations. But the treaty or the Protocol or the convention becomes important if the meaning of the expressions used by the Parliament is not clear and can be construed in more than one way. The reason is that if one of the meanings which can be properly ascribed is in consonance with the treaty obligations and the other meaning is not so consonant, the meaning which is consonant is to be preferred. Even where an Act had been passed to give effect to the convention which was scheduled to it, the words employed in the Act had to be interpreted in the well-established sense which they had in municipal law.

The relief of interlocutory mandatory injunctions are thus granted generally to preserve or restore the status quo of the last non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy until the final hearing when full relief may be granted or to compel the undoing of those acts that have been illegally done or the restoration of that which was wrongfully taken from the party complaining. But since the granting of such an injunction to a party who fails or would fail to establish his right at the trial may cause great injustice or irreparable harm to the party against whom it was granted or alternatively not granting of it to a party who succeeds or would succeed may equally cause great injustice or irreparable harm, courts have evolved certain guidelines. Generally stated these guidelines are:  (1)  The plaintiff has a strong case for trial. That is, it shall be of a higher standard than a prima facie case that is normally required for a prohibitory injunction.  (2)  It is necessary to prevent irreparable or serious injury which normally cannot be compensated in terms of money.  (3)  The balance of convenience is in favour of the one seeking such relief.•7",

Though apparently, there seem to be two divergent strands of thought, in judicial thinking, this court is of the opinion that the matter is one of the weight to be given to the materials on record, a fact dependent exercise, rather than of principle. That Section 9 grants wide powers to the courts in fashioning an appropriate interim order, is apparent from its text. Nevertheless, what the authorities stress is that the exercise of such power should be principled, premised on some known guidelines -therefore, the analogy of Orders 38 and 39. Equally, the court should not find itself unduly bound by the text of those provisions rather it is to follow the underlying principles. In this regard, the observations of Lord Hoffman in Films Rover International Ltd. v. Cannon Film Sales Ltd.(1986) 3 All ER 772 are fitting:  •But I think it is important in this area to distinguish between fundamental principles and what are sometimes described as 'guidelines', i.e. useful generalisations about the way to deal with the normal run of cases falling within a particular category. The principal dilemma about the grant of interlocutory injunctions, whether prohibitory or  mandatory, is that there is by definition a risk that the court may make the 'wrong' decision, in the sense of granting an injunction to a party who fails to establish his right at the trial (or would fail if there was a trial) or alternatively, in failing to grant an injunction to a party who succeeds (or would succeed) at trial. A fundamental principle is therefore that the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been 'wrong' in the sense I have described. The guidelines for the grant of both kinds of interlocutory injunctions are derived from this principle.•  7 Emphasis supplied.  8 FAO(OS) (COMM) 61/2016 & connected matter, decided on 03.07.2017",

The second point is that in cases in which there can be no dispute about the use of the term 'mandatory' to describe the injunction, the same question of substance will determine whether the case is 'normal' and therefore within the guideline or 'exceptional' and therefore requiring special treatment. If it appears to the court that, exceptionally, the case is one in which withholding a mandatory interlocutory injunction would in fact carry a greater risk of injustice than granting it even though the court does not feel a 'high degree of assurance' about the plaintiff's chances of establishing his right, there cannot be any rational basis for withholding the injunction.• •9  Against the aforesaid judgment of the Division Bench of this Court, the Supreme Court declined special leave to appeal.10  9 Emphasis supplied.  10 Order dated 28.07.2017 in SLP (C) 18558/2017",

The aforesaid view was upheld by the Division Bench13 . On the scope of Section 9 of the Act, the Division Bench held as follows:- •35. On the question of exercise of power under Section 9 of the A&C Act, we have already referred to Clauses 37.3.1 of the Concessionaire Agreement which is an express and mandatory provision when said agreement is terminated on account of concessionaire fault. We have also referred to Clauses 3.2 and 4.2 of the tripartite Escrow Agreement which refers to termination payment. To accept the plea of NHAI that section 9 of the A&C Act cannot be invoked, would negate and obliterate the aforesaid Clauses and their effect. In the aforesaid circumstances the ratio of decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Value Source Mercantile Limited Vs. Span Mechnotronix Limited (2014) 143 DRJ 505, is apposite, if not definite and conclusive. Referring to Section 9 of the A&C Act, this decision emphasized that the said provision uses the expression •interim measure of protection• as distinct from the expression •temporary injunction• used in Rules 1 and 2 of Order XXXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Interim injunction is one of the measures or orders prescribed in Clause (d) to Section 9 (ii) of the A&C Act, albeit a party to the arbitration agreement is entitled to apply for and seek •interim measure of protection•. Clause (e) to Section 9(ii) is a residuary power of the court to issue or direct other  \"interim measures of protection\". Thus, the court has the power to issue or direct other interim measures of protection as may appear to the court to be just and convenient. Section 9 encompass the power of making orders as the Civil Court has for the purpose of, and in relation to any proceedings before it. This decision refers to Rule 10 of Order XXXIX of the aforesaid Code which empowers the Court to direct to deposit payment of the admitted amount. Therefore the court exercising power under Section 9 of the A&C Act has the same power as that of a civil court during pendency of the suit.•14",

I am of the view that the refusal of an injunction in these circumstances carries a greater risk of irretrievable prejudice to the petitioner than grant of the injunction would occasion to the respondent.

Respondent has failed to appreciate that present invention meets the requirements of inventive step and without considering that the claimed medicament combination is not known from any of the prior arts or its combinations, Respondent has rejected the  application. Elaborating the arguments, it is submitted that Respondent failed to support his conclusion by showing that a skilled person would be able to arrive at the claimed invention based on the cited prior art D1 to D4 and wrongly applied hindsight analysis to pick and choose from numerous possibilities, without looking to the fact that synergy is an unpredictable phenomenon. This approach is against the decision by the Board of Appeals of the European Patent Office T-0970 dated 15.09.2004 ruling that prior disclosure must not be distorted or misinterpreted based on hindsight knowledge. In F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. & Anr. v.

D1 discloses a compound in a Markush-type claim, including Brexpiprazole, for use and treatment of Central Nervous System disorders, but does not disclose that synergistic effects can be obtained by combination use of Brexpiprazole with other drugs.

The patent application is a mere combination of Brexpiprazole with already known drugs only with new therapeutic uses. There is no inventive step as the compositions and combinations of products are known in the cited prior art documents. Subject matter of claims 1 to 6 lack inventive step under Section 2(1)(ja) of the Act, in view of documents D1 to D4, with regard to efficacy over the parent/base compound and the data provided is not sufficient to establish significant improvement in properties over the prior art parent compounds.

There is no mention of D2 and D3 as rightly pointed by learned counsel for the Appellant. Relevant part of the hearing notice is extracted hereunder:- “The reply submission by the applicant is not persuasive as D4 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising: (i) at least onecarbostyril derivatives (i.e. i.e. aripiprazole) in combination with (ii) at least one serotoninreuptake inhibitor, and (iii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (p. 6, line 6-11). It also discloses that the serotonin reuptake inhibitor can be fluoxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and escitalopram, and salts thereof (p.7, line 22-26). D4 also discloses a method for treating major depressive disorder by administering to a patient with major depressive disorder said composition (p.12, line 19-25). D1 discloses a heterocyclic compound of formula (I) or salts thereof, which the preferable compound (I) is 7-[4-(4-benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl-piperazin-1-yl)butoxy]-1 H-quinolin-2-one (p.12, line 10-14: see Compound (1)). D1 discloses that the above compound of formula (I) can be provided in a pharmaceutical composition as an active ingredient mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the treatment or prevention of central nervous system disorders, i.e. major depression (p. 13, line 16-23; & p. 14, line 4 ). A person skilled in the art would have been motivated to combine the teachings of D1 with D4 to produce a new composition for use in the very same treatment of major depressive disorder, and it is prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which is taught by the prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form a third composition to be used for the very same purpose. Hence the subject matter of claims 1-8 lacks inventive step u/s 2(1)(ja) of the Patents Act, 1970 in view of the prior art D1 and D4.”",

In yet another matter in Resprotect GmbH vs The Controller of Patents & Designs & Anr., IPAB Case No. OA/23/2010/PT/DEL, it was held that the Patent Office while dealing with grant of patent, exercises quasi-judicial power and a quasi-judicial authority is not an adversary of the patent applicant.

This action of the Respondent is clearly in the teeth of the doctrine of audi alterem partem and is sufficient to remand the matter for fresh adjudication. This Court also finds that the Appellant had specifically objected to application of Section 3(d) of the Act in determining claims 1 to 6. However, the impugned order shows that the Respondent has not dealt with the arguments made by the Appellant or the judgments cited in this context. Respondent has come to a conclusion on non-patentability under Section 3(d) of the Act by simply observing that claims 1 to 6 are mere new use of known substances, with no significant difference with regard to efficacy over the parent/base compound. No reasons are discernible in the order which weighed with the Respondent to arrive at the said conclusion and the impugned order cannot be termed anything but cryptic and unreasoned.",

The invention sought to be patented by the Appellant is based on the finding that synergistic effects can be obtained by the combination of ‘Component-1’: 7-[4-(4-benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl-piperazin-1-yl) butoxy]-lH-quinolin-2-one (hereinafter Brexpiprazole) or a salt thereof and  ‘Component-2’: at least one drug selected from the group consisting of (i) serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); or (ii) a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); or (iii) an anti-anxiety drug selected from diazepam or a salt thereof. D1 and D4 were cited as prior art. Appellant had brought out that D1 does not disclose that synergistic effects can be obtained by combination use of Brexpiprazole with other drugs and also does not disclose that Brexpiprazole can be used in combination with other drugs.

Moreover, D4 does not disclose synergistic effects by the combination of Brexpiprazole and other drugs. In order to distinguish the prior art, Appellant had categorically pointed out that Aripiprazole and Brexpiprazole are structurally different on three points, viz: (1) the presence or absence of a double bond in the carbostyril structure; (2) the substituent on the Piperazine ring (phenyl group in Aripiprazole vs. Benzothiophene in Brexpiprazole); and (3) the presence or absence of the substituents on the substituent (2) above (2,3-dichloro-substituted in Aripiprazole vs. unsubstituted in Brexpiprazole) and also that such differences have a large impact on the receptor binding profile and consequently, on the physiological effects of the drugs.",

                        "content": "Contentions articulated on behalf of the Plaintiffs can be captured as follows:  A.  Defendant/Natco is guilty of infringing the suit patent IN’645. The alleged manufacturing process disclosed by Natco is ‘equivalent’ to the process claimed in IN’645. Both processes describe an amide bond formation and implement the activation of a carboxylic acid moiety to facilitate the amide formation, to yield CTPR. Compared with IN’645, Defendant’s process (hereinafter referred to as ‘Natco process’) performs substantially the same function, i.e., activation of carboxylic acid moiety, in substantially the same way, i.e., coupling of carboxylic acid (Formula 2) with aniline (Formula 3), to achieve the same result, i.e., yield CTPR. IN’645 discloses that the invention relates to method for preparing compounds of Formula 1 by coupling carboxylic acids of Formula 2 with anthranilamides of Formula 3 using a sulfonyl chloride, in presence of a base and a solvent. Thus, the IN’645 and the Defendant’s process, both rely on activation of 3-Bromo-1-(3-Chloro-2-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid into an activated intermediate, which reacts with 2-Amino-5-chloro-3, N-dimethylbenzamide to produce CTPR and are ‘equivalent’. Plaintiffs have relied on the following schematic presentation:  B.  Both these processes employ a similar synthetic strategy, i.e., stoichiometric activation of carboxylic acid moiety and judged from this perspective also, are equivalent. ‘Doctrine of Equivalents’ propounds that despite an absence of literal infringement of a patent claim, infringement can be proven if an element of the accused product or service and a claimed element of patented invention are found to be substantially equivalent. This prevents a person from practicing a fraud on a patent by substituting obvious equivalents of elements in the claims in order to avoid their literal language. If the proposition made by the Defendant that scope of a patent is limited to its literal elements is accepted, it would allow a competitor to make an unimportant or insubstantial change to a patented invention and defeat the patent. Moreover, where a patentee describes his invention and claims it in that form, which most perfectly embodies it, he is deemed to claim every form in which his invention may be copied. In Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.S. 17 (1997), it is observed that equivalency must be determined against the context of the patent, the prior art and the circumstances of the case and is neither a prisoner of a formula nor an absolute to be considered in a vacuum.  C.  In order to examine the application of the doctrine, Courts have developed five legal tests: (a) all elements rule; (b) Tri-partite test; (c) insubstantial differences test; (d) obviousness test and (e) known-interchangeability test. In Sotefin SA v. Indraprastha Cancer Society and Research Center and Others, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 516, this Court observed that in order to determine infringement, it is imperative to reach a finding that ‘all essential elements’ of the suit  patent are present in the infringing process and applied the Doctrine of Equivalents to test if Defendant’s process infringed the suit patent. Court also relied on the pith and marrow doctrine to examine if the substituted element in the infringing product does the same task, in substantially the same way, to accomplish substantially the same result. In Raj Parkash v. Mangat Ram Chowdhry & Others, 1977 SCC OnLine Del 33, it was held that a minor variation cannot be treated as a shield from piracy, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Free World Trust v. Electro Sante Inc., (2000) 2 SCR 1024, wherein it was held that non-essential elements may be omitted or substituted but that too would not shield infringement.  D.  The issue that the Court needs to determine is whether Defendant’s process covers all the essential features of the patented process and only omits, varies or adds some non-essential features. Analysis of the two processes leads to a conclusion that the answer to the question is in the affirmative and the difference that the Defendant endeavours to carve out between the reagents, i.e., thionyl chloride and sulfonyl chloride per se is immaterial. In Line 10 of Page 9 of WO 2019/207595 it is disclosed that the process can use both organic and inorganic chloride, including thionyl chloride (inorganic) and oxalyl chloride (organic). The specific properties of these compounds, i.e., physical and chemical, are also irrelevant for the present purpose as chlorides serve only one purpose, i.e., stoichiometric activation of carboxylic acid group, which then reacts with the amino group to form CTPR and no material difference can be urged between the two processes, merely on account of use of a different chloride. The reagent sulfonyl chloride is a reactant which facilitates coupling  reaction between compound of Formula 2 and compound of Formula 3. The complete specification of IN’645 also contemplates various other equivalent reagents to facilitate the coupling reaction, which is evident from Page 8 Lines 13 to 25 of the Patent Specification IN’645, wherein it is clearly stated that sulfonyl chloride is ‘preferred’ because of its commercial availability. It is thus wholly irrelevant if thionyl chloride is different from sulphonyl chloride, as a minor variation cannot shield the Defendant from infringement.  E.  Stand of the Defendant that its process involves a difference sequence is also of no avail to the Defendant and it is deliberately attempting to introduce limitations into claim 1 of the suit patent, which do not exist. There is no base mentioned in claim 1 and certainly, no limitation with respect to sequence of combining the reactants. The reactants can be combined in a variety of orders, as stated on page 8 of IN’645, such as combining sulfonyl chloride with carboxylic acid of Formula 2 to form a mixture and then combining the mixture with aniline of Formula 3.  F.  CIBRC Registration Certificate of the Defendant states ‘Methane Sulphonic acid impurities’ are present in Defendant’s approved process. These can be formed only if sulfonyl chloride is used. In any case, thionyl chloride stated to be used by the Defendant is equivalent to sulfonyl chloride since both are Reagents and have the same function. In essence, the starting materials are the same i.e. the acid and amide intermediates, the end result is the same i.e. CTPR and the Reagents are equivalent, leaving no doubt that the process of the Defendant infringes IN’645. IN’645 description is not limited to any sequence or any choice of reagent and any chloride can be used which explicitly shows that sulfonyl chloride is a non-essential element of  IN’645 process and the change of sequencing in the Defendant’s process would have no impact.  G.  Dr. Nair, in his report, clearly notes that there is equivalence in the two processes. In answer to question no. 7 (iv) of the FMC Terms of Reference, it is stated ‘Yes, though not literally’ and this is the essence of Doctrine of Equivalents. Infringement is not to be determined by the resultant characteristics of the by-products but by equivalence of processes and Dr. Nair’s report acknowledges that impugned process is equivalent to IN’ 645 process.  H.  Dr. Vikrant Arun Adsool, who is presently a Chemistry Team Leader at FMC Agro Singapore Pte. Limited and an expert in organic and process chemistry, has filed an affidavit, after comparing and analysing the two processes and has categorically stated that the two processes are equivalent and that the process/routes employed by Natco falls within the scope of claim 1 of the suit patent.",

                        "content": "The arguments urged on behalf of the Defendant/NATCO, the litigation adversary, are encapsulated as follows:  A.  IN’645 process and Natco process are for preparing anthranilic acid derivatives and compounds obtained include CTPR. IN’645 process involves using a specific organic chloride viz. sulfonyl chloride (R8SO2Cl) reagent for coupling carboxylic acid intermediate with aniline intermediate in a single step. The scope of protection vide claim 1 is expressly limited to this coupling using sulfonyl chloride in the light of Section 10(4)(c) and Section 48(b) of the Act. The only sulfonyl chloride exemplified is methane SO2Cl and IN’645 does not identify/refer/disclose any other organic or inorganic chloride, which could be used as a reagent. Per contra, Natco process, for which  approval was obtained for Technical Indigenous Manufacture under Section 9(3) of the Insecticides Act and disclosed in its EMP and Process Patent Application, involves two separate and discrete stages:  (a)  carboxylic acid intermediate is converted to an acid chloride using thionyl chloride in a first reactor and the bio-products so formed viz. SO2 and HCl gases are scrubbed in caustic soda solution to give NaCl and NaHSO3, which are useful in food and cosmetic industries; and  (b)  acid chloride of step (a) is reacted with amide intermediate in a second reactor to obtain CTPR.  B.  Natco process, approved by CIBRC, for manufacture of CTPR is different from IN’645 process and there is no infringement, since not only is the reagent used by Natco, i.e., inorganic thionyl chloride different from organic sulfonyl chloride, but even the sequence of reaction is different and the process is completely outside the scope of claims of IN’645. The Certificate of Analysis of Ross Laboratories, an independent laboratory certified by CIBRC, states that there is no methane sulfonic acid impurity in the Natco Approved process, which shows that the process does not use any sulfonic acid, let alone methane sulfonic acid. The scope of protection given by the claims of IN’645 is limited to coupling by using sulfonyl chloride, which is evident from its specification read with the objectives of the invention and the end result can only be achieved by using methane sulfonic chloride. Section 10(4) of the Act expressly states that the claim defines the scope of protection and claim 1 of IN’645 is limited to acid + amide + sulfonyl chloride. Section 48(b) militates against any broad extension of application of Doctrine of Equivalents since it uses the language ‘that process’ and ‘product obtained directly by that process in India’.  C.  The Supreme Court in Martin F. D’Souza v. Mohd. Ishfaq, (2009) 3 SCC 1, has expressly observed that where independent experts are appointed by a Court, their opinion should be considered binding. Both the Scientific Advisors appointed by this Court, with the consent of the parties have opined that Natco process is different from IN’645 process and the former is not within the scope of claims 1 to 5 of the latter, including the finding that Natco uses SOCl2, which is not covered in claims of IN’645. Both the Advisors have specifically opined that the use of sulfonyl chloride to couple the acid and amide is essential to the process of IN’645.  D.  In answer to a specific question, if any Methane Sulfonic acid impurity is present in CTPR formed in Natco process, the answer by Dr. Nair is ‘No’, while Prof. Bhanage has stated that it is not present in the dossier provided (Pages 73 to 96) and if it is present then it will arise only from methane sulfonyl chloride hydrolysis to acid and cannot be formed in the Natco process. Both Advisors agree that thionyl chloride is different from sulfonyl chloride. Insofar as equivalence of the processes is concerned, Dr. Nair has stated that they are not literally equivalent and that the impurity profile distinguishes the processes. Prof. Bhanage has elaborated on another aspect by showing differences between thionyl and sulfonyl chlorides in terms of reactivity and physical properties of the two reagents.  E.  The judgment in Sotefin SA (supra), relied upon by the Plaintiffs is inapplicable to the present case as the same is in the context of a product patent and not a process patent. While for a product patent, an overall comparison of the product to the claims may be permissible to determine equivalence, in a process patent separate considerations  apply and the relevant guidelines are to  be found in the case of  Warner-Jenkinson Co., Inc. (supra). The relevant test is ‘all elements’ test i.e. not only the starting materials and the end product, but all reagents and each step must be equivalent between the patented and the impugned process. This is supported by the Article Doctrine of Equivalents: Scope & Limitations by D. Patodia, S. Jain and U. Shukla, published in Journal of Intellectual Property Right (VOL. 12, May 2007, pp 314-329), relied upon by the Plaintiffs. In any event, the judgement in Sotefin SA (supra) does not aid the Plaintiffs as in the facts of that case the Scientific Advisors had opined that 17 out of the 19 elements were common in the competing products and after analysis the Court found that the distinction sought to be brought out in the remaining 2 ‘non-essential’ elements was insubstantial, in contrast to the present case, where both Advisors have opined that use of sulfonyl chloride is ‘essential’ to the process claimed in IN’645 and the reagent used in Natco process differs, considerably in most properties. The case of Raj Parkash (supra) also does not support the Plaintiffs’ case since it was under the 1911 Indian Patents and Designs Act, which did not have any provision pari materia to Section 10(4) of the Act.  F.  The product patent IN’307 has already expired on 13.08.2022 and given the clear findings of the two Scientific Advisors, in support of Natco as also considering that CTPR is a seasonal product with the primary season being the Kharif Season, from September to December, Natco be permitted to launch the product, subject to maintaining monthly statement of accounts and an assurance that Natco will not use the process claimed in IN’645 or any other process that infringes the suit patent. It is a settled law that no interim relief  should be granted unless there is a clear case of irretrievable harm which cannot be compensated in terms of damages. Plaintiffs do not work the suit patent IN’645 in India and are only trying to extend the monopoly over the product CTPR despite the product patent having lapsed on 13.08.2022. No equitable relief can, therefore, be granted to the Plaintiffs in terms of the judgment in Franz Xaver Humer v. New  Yash Engineers, 1996 SCC OnLine Del 243, and in any case, if the Plaintiffs succeed, monetary compensation and damages would be an adequate remedy. In suit being CS(COMM) 608/2022, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court had declined to grant an injunction on a process patent as the Court was of the view that the damages will ultimately suffice. Natco has already suffered a loss of at least Rs. 100 crores on account of the restraint order and any further restraint will destroy the entire investment and would also be detrimental to public interest. Plaintiffs have over 25 patents and applications for CTPR and will continue to litigate till 2041 while grave prejudice will be caused to Natco in case launch of its product is not permitted. Be it noted that even the process patent IN’332 with respect to which the Plaintiffs have an injunction in another suit has also expired on 13.08.2022.",

The written description also provides reference to various embodiments relating inter alia, to the sequence of addition of carboxylic acid of Formula 2 with aniline of Formula 3 and the sulfonyl chloride as follows:  “Embodiments of the present innovation include: Embodiment M 14. The method wherein the carboxylic acid of Formula 2, aniline of Formula 3 and sulfonyl chloride are combined at a temperature is between about -70 and 100℃. Embodiment M 17. The method wherein the carboxylic acid of Formula 2 is combined with the aniline of Formula 3 to form a mixture, and then the mixture is combined with the sulfonyl chloride. Embodiment M 18. The method of Embodiment M17 wherein a base is combined with the mixture either before or after combining with the sulfonyl chloride. Embodiment M 19. The method of Embodiment M 17 wherein a base is combined with the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 to form the mixture before combining with the sulfonyl  chloride.  Embodiment M 20. The method wherein a base is combined with the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 and the sulfonyl chloride.  Embodiment M29. The method of Embodiment M 17 wherein a solvent is combined with the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 to form the mixture before combining with the sulfonyl chloride.”  d)  The various embodiments, as rightly pointed out by the Defendant have one common factor, i.e., the sequence, where the carboxylic acid of Formula 2 and aniline of Formula 3 are first mixed, whether with the base or a solvent etc. and thereafter sulfonyl chloride is added to the mixture so obtained. In fact, emphasis on the sequence is further evident from the following:  “In the present method, the sulfonyl chloride is combined with the pyrazolecarboxylic acid of Formula 2 and the aniline of Formula 3. The reactants can be combined in a variety of orders, such as combining the sulfonyl chloride with the carboxylic acid of Formula 2 to form a mixture and then combining the mixture with the aniline of Formula 3. However, for preparing the particular N-phenylpyrazole-1-carboxamides of Formula 1, the most preferable order of combination has been found to comprise combining the carboxylic acid of Formula 2 with the aniline of Formula 3 to form a mixture and then combining the sulfonyl chloride with the mixture (e.g., adding the sulfonyl chloride to the mixture of the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3), because this order of the addition allows convenient control of the coupling process. The rate of reaction is readily controlled by simply controlling the rate of addition of the sulfonyl chloride compound. Therefore, an embodiment of note of the present method comprises the sequential steps of (1) combining a carboxylic acid of Formula 2 and an aniline of Formula 3 to form a mixture, and (2) then combining the mixture with a sulfonyl chloride. Although addition of the sulfonyl chloride to the mixture containing the aniline of Formula 2 potentially could result in undesirable side reactions, it has been discovered that the particular stereoelectronic profiles of the  compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 facilitate obtaining remarkably high yields of compounds of Formula 1 using the present method.” [emphasis added]”  e)  Significantly, it is noted in the detailed description that though the reactants can be combined in a variety of orders, such as combining sulfonyl chloride with carboxylic acid to form a mixture and then combining the mixture with aniline, however, for preparing the particular N-Phenylpyrazole-1-Carboxamide of Formula 1, the most preferable order of combination is to combine the acid and aniline to form a mixture and then combine the sulfonyl chloride with the mixture, as this order allows convenient control of the coupling process and the rate of reaction is readily controlled by simply controlling the rate of addition of sulfonyl chloride compound. It is further described that as the starting materials of Formula 2 and 3 are typically solids at ordinary ambient temperatures, the method is most satisfactorily conducted using a solvent in which the starting compounds have significant solubility and thus the method is conducted in a liquid phase comprising a solvent. It needs emphasis that the written description also explains the role of sulfonyl chloride and notes that its compounds preferred for the present method, because of the commercial availability, include methanesulfonyl chloride and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, however, methanesulfonyl chloride is more preferred for the reasons of lower cost, ease of addition and/or less waste.",

I may usefully allude to the observations in a recent decision of this Court in Sotefin SA (supra), where the Court has held that in order to determine infringement, it is imperative to reach a finding that ‘all essential elements’ of the suit patent are present in the infringing process. It was also held that in order to examine if the substituted element in the infringed product does the same task, in substantially the same way, to accomplish substantially the same result, the pith and marrow doctrine, also known as Doctrine of Purposive Construction, needs to be applied by the Court. Reliance was placed on the judgement in Rodi & Wienenberger A.G. v. Henry Showell Ltd., 1966 RPC (441), wherein it was propounded that all essential elements of the suit patent must be found in the process alleged to be infringing. Relevant para is as follows:  “If the language which the patentee has used in the claims which follow the description upon its true construction specifies a number of elements or integers acting in a particular relation to one another as constituting the essential features of his claim, the monopoly which he obtains is for that specified combination of elements or integers so acting in relation to one another-and for nothing else. There is no infringement of his monopoly unless each and every one of such elements is present in the process or article which is alleged to infringe his  patent and such elements also act in relation to one another in the manner claimed. The law as to the principles of construction of claims in specifications in the modern form seems to me so laid down clearly and authoritatively in the Judgment of Upjohn, L.I. in Van de Leiy v. Bamfords 20 Ltd. [1961] R.P.C. 296, which was approved by the majority of the House of Lords on appeal: [1963] R.P.C. 61.”",

Relevant paras are as follows:  “33. The critical question is whether the elements not found in the Smart Dollies, are essential or not, so as to construe an infringement. For determining the question of infringement, it must be borne in mind that the nonessential or trifling variations or additions in the product would not be germane, so long as the substance of the invention is found to be copied. Pure literal construction is not be adopted, rather, doctrine of purposive construction should be applied. The court shall also apply Doctrine of Equivalence to examine if the substituted element in the infringing product does the same work, in substantially the same way, to accomplish substantially the same result. On this aspect, lets first take note of the judicial precedence. In the case of Raj Prakash v. Mangat Ram, a division bench of this court held that a minor variation cannot be treated as a shield from piracy, in the following words:  “12. We have, therefore, to read the specifications and the claims from the point of view of the persons in the trade manufacturing film strip viewers.

He further observed that where one of the claims in respect of which infringement is alleged is wide enough to cover all methods for achieving particular result, the question is not as to the method actually followed by the plaintiffs but is whether the method followed by the defendants is covered by the claim in the plaintiff’s patent. The onus as to the invalidity of a plaintiff’s patent and the grounds of insufficiency of description, want of novelty, absence of inventive steps and want of utility was rightly placed on the defendants. The learned Judge further observed that in an action for infringment of patent to meet the defence under Section 29(2) read with Section 26, that the patent was invalid due to insufficiency of description, the claim in the specifications of the patent need only be as clear as the subject admits, and the patentee need not so simplify his claim as to make it easy for infringers to evade it.”",

This is the simplest way and indeed the only sure way to find out whether there is a piracy. This is what was done in the hair-pin case, above-referred to, and is, indeed, always done.  Unessential features in an infringing article or process are of no account. If the infringing goods are made with the same object in view which is attained by the patented article, then a minor variation does not mean that there is no piracy. A person is guilty of infringement if he makes what is in substance the equivalent of the patented article. Some trifling or unessential variation has to be ignored. There is a catena of authority in support of this view. We need not cite all those cases which were brought to our notice at the Bar. Suffice it to quote the words of Lord Denning, M. R. in Beecham Group Limited v. Bristol Laboratories Ltd. and another, 1967 (16) R.P.C. 406 (12):- “The evidence here shows that in making hetacillin in the United States the defendants use a principal part of the processes which are protected here by the English patents. The importation and sale here is prima facie infringement.  “There is a further point. A person is guilty of infringement, if he makes what is in substance the equivalent of the patented article. He cannot get out of it by some trifling or unessential variation…… On the evidence as it stands, there is ground for saying that hetacillin is medically equivalent to ampicillin. As soon as it is put into the human body, it does, after an interval, by delayed action, have the same effect as ampicillin. In these circumstances, I think there is a prima facie case for saying there was an infringement. The process is so similar and the product so equivalent that it is in substance the same as ampicillin.”",

The appeal thus raises the fundamental issue of how best to resolve the tension between “literal infringement” and “substantive infringement” to achieve a fair and predictable result. There has been considerable discussion of this issue in Canada and elsewhere, which I will discuss briefly in support of the following propositions:  (a)  The Patent Act promotes adherence to the language of the claims.  (b)  Adherence to the language of the claims in turn promotes both fairness and predictability.  (c)  The claim language must, however, be read in an informed and purposive way.  (d)  The language of the claims thus construed defines the monopoly. There is no recourse to such vague notions as the “spirit of the invention” to expand it further.  (e)  - The claims language will, on a purposive construction, show that some elements of the claimed invention are essential while others are nonessential. The identification of elements as essential or non-essential is made:  (i)  on the basis of the common knowledge of the worker skilled in the art to which the patent relates;  (ii)  as of the date the patent is published;  (iii)  having regard to whether or not it was obvious to the skilled reader at the time the patent was published that a variant of a particular element would not make a difference to the way in which the invention works; or  (iv)  according to the intent of the inventor, expressed or inferred from the claims, that a particular element is essential irrespective of its practical effect;  (v)  without, however, resort to extrinsic evidence of the inventor's intention.  )  (f There is no infringement if an essential element is different or omitted.

Each element contained in a patent claim is  deemed material to defining the scope of the patented invention, and thus the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to individual elements of the claim, not to the invention as a whole. It is important to ensure that the application of the doctrine, even as to an individual element, is not allowed such broad play as to effectively eliminate that element in its entirety. So long as the doctrine of equivalents does not encroach beyond the limits just described, or beyond related limits to be discussed infra this page and 31-34, 39, n. 8, and 39-40, we are confident that the doctrine will not vitiate the central functions of the patent claims themselves. xxx xxx xxx  …  In our view, the particular linguistic framework used is less important than whether the test is probative of the essential inquiry: Does the accused product or process contain elements identical or equivalent to each claimed element of the patented invention? Different linguistic frameworks may be more suitable to different cases, depending on their particular facts. A focus on individual elements and a special vigilance against allowing the concept of equivalence to eliminate completely any such elements should reduce considerably the imprecision of whatever language is used. An analysis of the role played by each element in the context of the specific patent claim will thus inform the inquiry as to whether a substitute element matches the function, way, and result of the claimed element, or whether the substitute element plays a role substantially different from the claimed element. With these limiting principles as a backdrop, we see no purpose in going further and micromanagaing the Federal Circuit’s particular word choice for analyzing equivalence. We expect that the Federal Circuit will refine the formulation of the test for equivalence in the orderly course of case-by-case determinations, and we leave such refinement to that court’s sound judgment in this area of its special expertise.”",

Doctrine of Equivalents should be applied to examine if the substituted element(s) in the infringing product does the same work, in substantially the same way, to accomplish the same result. Seen in this light, it is now required to be considered, if the use of thionyl chloride in the Natco process is a minor/trivial change from use of sulfonyl chloride, which as a reagent is critical to the novelty and functionality of the suit patent, so as to infringe the suit patent, applying the Doctrine of Equivalents. Both Advisors agree that thionyl chloride and sulfonyl chloride are different. Relevant would it be in this regard to refer to question no. (iii) in Terms of Reference (I)/Natco.

The reply is as follows:  “Reply: No, the reagents, thionyl chloride and sulfonyl chlorides are different. The said reagents have different physical and chemical characteristics.  The reagent thionyl chloride (SOCl2) used in Defendant’s process is different from the reagent sulfonyl chloride of formula 4 i.e. R8S(O)2Cl claimed in claims 1 to 11 of IN298645.

Additionally, it requires a mention that in the Natco process, thionyl chloride is used as a chlorinating agent to react with carboxylic acid to displace the –OH group present in the acid and replace it with the chlorine atom to form an acid chloride, while in the Plaintiffs’ process sulfonyl chloride is added to the mixture of a Carboxylic acid, Amide, Analine and a Base to activate the process and thus acts as a ‘coupling agent’ to control the rate of reaction as well as the yield produced by it. In fact, it the case of the Plaintiffs that the advantages of sulfonyl chloride according to IN’645 reside in its utility for acid-amide coupling besides its convenience to use, low cost and the advantage of being able to control the rate of coupling. ‘Chlorination’ is a process in which chlorine is introduced into a molecule while ‘coupling reaction’ refers to class of organic reactions that involve joining of two chemical species, usually with the help of a metal catalyst.

(iv) Whether the Defendant’s process for preparing Chlorantraniliprole (CTPR) is equivalent to the process claimed by the suit patent IN’645?  Reply: Yes, though not literally. The equivalence is distinguished in resultant impurity profile of the final product (CTPR) obtained by using thionyl chloride in place of methane sulfonyl chloride in the Defendant’s two-step process as against the Plaintiff’s process in a single reactor.  In the suit patent IN’645, the process for preparing Chlorantraniliprole(CTPR) comprises reacting carboxylic acid of Formula 2, the aniline compound of Formula 3 and the sulfonyl chloride of Formula (4) particularly methane sulfonyl chloride in single reactor.  Moreover, in IN’645 process due to the use of methane sulfonyl chloride there is formation of the solid toxic byproduct methane sulfonic acid which is harzardous to the environment. In Defendant’s process the use of thionyl chloride results in liberation of SO2 (gas) and HCl (gas). The liberated gases are scrubbed and absorbed in caustic soda solution to give sodium chloride and sodium bisulfite having use in food and cosmetic industry.  The results of the reaction using methane sulfonyl chloride in the suit patent IN’645 compared to the reaction using thinoyl chloride in the defendant’s process does not produce the same result in view of the resultant characteristics of the by-products and impact of the impurity profile of the final product.  As such there is no literal equivalence between the Defendant’s process and the Plaintiff’s IN’645 process.”  (b) . Additionally, in the earlier Report dated 05.08.2022, Dr. Nair, had observed as under:  “Moreover, in IN’645 process due to the use of methane sulfonyl chloride there is formation of the solid toxic by-product methane sulfonic acid which  is harzardous to the environment. In Natco’s process the use of thionyl chloride results in SO2 (gas) and HCl (gas) which are released and may be collected and converted to respective acids. There is no formation of solid by-products that could cause harm to the environment in the Natco’s process. Further, IN’645 employs costly reagent methane sulfonyl chloride, compared to thinoyl chloride used by the Defendant.  The results of the reaction using methane sulfonyl chloride compared to the reaction using thinoyl chloride does not produce the same result in view of the resultant characterstics of the by-products and impact of the impurity profile of the final product. As such there is no equivalence.  (c) .

In suit patent IN298645, the carboxylic acid of formula 2 (e.g. 3-Bromo-1-(3-Chloro-2-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid) and the aniline of formula 3 (e.g. 2-Amino-5-chloro-3, N-dimethylbenzamide) are first mixed in base to obtain the mixture followed by addition of sulfonyl chloride (R8S(O)2Cl) in the same reactor to yield the final product of formula 1, as claimed in claim 1, claims 5 to 9 and described in the specification.  In the suit patent IN’645, the base is combined with the compounds of Formulae 2 and 3 to form the mixture before combining with sulfonyl chloride. All the three reagents are added for the reaction to occur in a single reactor.  It is noted that the by-products in Defendant process are SO2 (gas) and HCl (gas) which are scrubbed and absorbed in caustic soda solution to give sodium bisulfite and sodium chloride respectively, whereas, in the suit patent IN298645 the by-product is solid methane sulphonic acid.  Hence, the Defendant’s process is different and distinct from the suit Patent IN298645.”",

Sulphonyl chloride is an essential element of suit patent and use of thionyl chloride as a reagent coupled with a different sequence of the reaction, as brought forth by the Scientific Advisors, cannot be termed as an insignificant or trivial or insubstantial change in the Natco process and thus the process prima facie does not come under the rigors of Doctrine of Equivalents. The Advisors were appointed with the consent and agreement of the parties and needless to state their opinion and findings needs to be respected. Moreover, there is no challenge to the findings of the Advisors. Learned counsel for the Defendant has rightly relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Martin F.

Suffice would it be to state at this stage that in the light of the opinions given by two Scientific Advisors, as aforementioned, the affidavit filed by Dr. Adsool cannot be placed on a higher pedestal, besides the fact that he is an employee of the Plaintiffs. In my prima facie view, even otherwise the conclusion drawn by Dr. Adsool does not seem to be correct in view of the fact that when sulfonyl chloride is used in a reaction, the process proceeds differently as compared to when thionyl chloride is used i.e. equating the formation of acid chloride in the Natco process to coupling of carboxylic acid and amide intermediates in the FMC process is wholly incorrect, as opined by both the Scientific Advisors. It bears repetition to state that Section 10(4) of the Act expressly states that claims define the scope of protection. Claim 1 of IN’645 is limited to acid+amide+sulfonyl chloride. On a pointed query, the Advisors have opined that the Natco process is outside the scope of claims of IN’645, where the suit patent is limited to coupling of carboxylic acid intermediate with analine using sulfonyl chloride. This is apparent from the complete specification of IN’645 which sets out the objective of the invention which can only be achieved by using sulfonyl chloride, particularly, methane sulfonic chloride.",

The proposition of law is beyond any debate, however, on facts the said judgment is distinguishable from the present case. Bare reading of the judgment shows that in the said case the independent Scientific Advisors had opined that 17 of the 19 elements of claim No. 1 of the suit patent were found in the infringing product. On an analysis of the Report as well as having examined the two elements, i.e., ‘hinges’ and ‘immobilization of rear wheels’ in the infringing product, Court was of the view that these elements did not make any substantial difference in the functionality and did not have material effect on the working of the invention, as asserted by the Defendants therein. In this background, the Court found that the changes were insignificant and prima facie case of infringement of suit patent was made out by the Plaintiff therein.

Thereafter, during the pendency of these proceedings, after these applications were brought to the notice of the Court, SA2 was withdrawn by the Plaintiff by submitting a Request for Withdrawal of the Application for Patent on 21st July, 2022. Mr. Sibal, ld. Sr. Counsel, submits that in the specification of SA1, an almost identical patent has been sought for an OFC which consists of 24 optical fibers within each sleeve. The filing of this patent application on the same date as the suit patent shows that the distinction between the two specifications is only between the numbers 16 and 24. Thus, the specific mention of 16 fibers within a sleeve in the suit patent, is a deliberate and conscious act of the Plaintiff to distinguish itself from the prior art and its other applications on the basis of the number of fibers in the sleeve. Moreover, it is telling that the inventors in the suit patent and in these two applications are also common.",

An identical OFC was contemplated as per this specification, which has all the elements of the Claims in the suit patent. Pursuant to this product specification, the Defendant made supplies to RJIL and there are contemporaneous documents which support this plea, including a purchase order invoice dated 5th December, 2013, being Purchase Order No.152/63005654 and an affidavit given by RJIL that such OFCs were supplied to them by the Defendant in 2015 as well.  •  Each of the elements in Claim 1 of the suit patent and the figure depicted in the specification of the RJIL OFC at page 13, match  with each other. Illustratively, Figure 1A attached to the suit patent’s specification is also referred, to match the suit patent to the RJIL OFC.  •  The only difference is in the number of optical fibers which are enclosed in one sleeve. In the RJIL OFC, the number of optical fibers in each tube ranges between 2 to 12, whereas in Claim 1 of the suit patent, the same is described as 16 optical fibers. Thus, the use of the number 16 is neither accidental nor a typographical error and was a device of the Plaintiff merely to distinguish the OFC in the suit patent from the prior art already existing in the market.  •  Further reliance is placed upon the aramid yarn cross binding feature in the RJIL OFC, the diameter of the RJIL OFC, which is 245 ± 5 (at point 6 under the column titled G652D) and the other elements being the CSM and the sleeve. The feature of 250 microns is mapped to paragraph [0009] of the specification of the suit patent, showing that the same is the diameter of the Plaintiff’s OFC as well.  •  A sample of the physical OFC has been produced before Court.  •  As per the Defendant, this one document is sufficient to destroy the novelty of the suit patent. In any event, he relies upon some further documents.",

It is submitted that disclosure of RJIL document does not read on to the claims of IN'369 for at-least the following reasons:  •  Cable of RJIL document has an aramid cross binding provided between a water  blocking tape and outer sheath and thus the aramid strength member is not a strengthening layer acting as a binding element. RJIL has no disclosure or even suggestion regarding a layer surrounding the one or more sleeve, wherein the layer is one or more strengthening layer acting as a binding element.  •  The cable of IN'369 has one or more water swellable yarns inside the optical fiber cable positioned between the one or more buffer tubes. Cable of RJIL document in contrast has a water blocking tape wrapped around the tubes which is different from providing water swellable yarns positioned between the one or more buffer tubes.  •  Further, although there is discussion on strength member in paragraph 5.4 of RJIL document there is no teaching or suggestion as to how aramid is cross binding to act as strength member. Paragraph 5.4 simply states that FRP rod is a central strength member and to provide additional strength. aramid/glass yarn shall be used in addition to central strength member in the periphery. Aramid in D1 is thus a peripheral strength member -longitudinal.  •  Further, as per paragraph 5.5 of RJIL document which relates to core wrapping and moisture protection, main cable core (containing loose tubes stranded around Central strength member) shall be wrapped by a layers) of super-absorbant water swellable tape / yarns. Core (loose tubes stranded around Central strength member)  is thus wrapped by a tape and not a strength layer as binding element.  •  Furthermore as per paragraph 5.8 of RJIL document, Rip cord under the HDPE sheath shall be readily distinguishable from any other components (e.g., Aramid yarns, etc.) utilized in the construction of the cable. This implies that aramid is longitudinal/parallel with the rip cord. If aramid would be used for binding it would already be distinguishable as it would be wrapped around the core and not parallel with the rip cord.”",

In Gigacom Document, a water blocking Kevlar yarn surrounds the FRP, whereas in IN’369, one or more water swellable yarns are positioned inside the optical fiber cable positioned between the one or more buffer tubes. The water blocking yarn of Gigacom Document is thus different. Furthermore, a water blocking Kevlar yarn will be a rigid yarn and cannot provide binding.  In the Gigacom Document, the rip cord is shown under the water blocking yarn (surrounding the loose tubes). It is known that function of ripcord is to tear off outer sheath to function. Accordingly, for ripcord is to tear off outer sheath to function. Accordingly, for ripcord of Gigacom to function which is provided under the water blocking yarn, the ripcord has to go through or tear the water blocking yarn. For this, it is required that longitudinal yarns be provided to allow the ripcord to go through and tear the sheath. It is thus clear that the yarns around the tubes are placed longitudinally so that the yarns have gap in-between for ripcord to function and thus the yarns do not function as a strength layer acting as a binding element.

In fact, the feature claimed by the Plaintiff to be novel and inventive, i.e., the cross-binding yarn is a common feature in all the documents and not a distinguishing feature. Moreover, all three documents disclosed the use of a similar type of yarn i.e., made of aramid, polypropylene or Kevlar, which strengthens and binds the buffer tubes. In this regard, this Court notes that it is not necessary while analyzing prior art documents that the same language as used in the suit patent, has to be used in the prior art in order for it to be novelty destroying or to show a lack of inventive step. It is possible that different terminologies or similar material is used in the prior art. For instance, in the present case, the purpose of using any specific material need not be spelt out in the prior art documents. The use of a yarn having similar or same properties would be sufficient to show that the purpose of the use of the yarn is the same. Thus, the overall disclosure and teachings in the prior art has to be  compared with that of the suit patent. If the difference does not disclose a novel or inventive feature, the submission of invalidity would hold ground.",

The difference as to the number of optical fibers according to the Plaintiff would be immaterial inasmuch as 16 is only an illustrative number. The Plaintiff has submitted that this would also be borne out from the complete specification of the suit patent, where the Plaintiff has stated as under:  “[0029] Reference will now be made in detail to selected embodiments of the present disclosure in conjunction with accompanying figures. The embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, and the present disclosure should not be construed as limited to the embodiments described. …  [0032] In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the optical fiber cable 100 is used for communication purposes. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the optical fiber cable 100 is a 96F micro optical fiber cable. In addition, 96F corresponds to 96 optical fibers. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the number of optical fibers is less than 96. Further, the optical fiber cable 100 has a small diameter which makes the optical fiber cable 100 suitable for installation in the micro ducts.  [0033] The optical fiber cable 100 is made of a plurality of layers. The plurality of layers encloses one or more buffer tubes. Each of the one or more  buffer tubes is a loose buffer tube. Each buffer tube of the one or more buffer tubes encloses a plurality of optical fibers. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of optical fibers is loosely held inside the one or more buffer tubes. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the one or more buffer tubes of a plurality of buffer tubes are fixed.

However, even if it is assumed that 16 is merely an illustrative number, the fact that almost identical OFCs were known in the existing state of art, as is reflected also in the prior art documents discussed above, poses a serious threat to the validity of the suit patent itself. The number of optical fibers would not be a sufficiently distinguishing feature. Moreover, an overall examination of all features of the OFCs shows that the differences disclosed above, between the prior art documents and the suit patent are almost negligible and at this stage, this Court is of the opinion that the validity of the suit patent is prima facie suspect. The said two prior arts, if not novelty destroying, clearly point to a lack of inventive step in the suit patent. Any person who is skilled in the art, who has knowledge of the prior art documents could have easily made the minor modification of changing the numbers of fibers in the sleeve or adding horizontal water swellable yarns (112a and 112b). The features in the suit patent do not  point to any inventive step. Almost all the features of the patented product were present in the prior art and in the state of the art.",

It is, therefore, clear that the opportunity provided in Section 25(1) is not an empty formality. The Legislature in its wisdom has specifically conferred on any person a right to make representation in writing, objecting the grant of patent and that is to be made by raising specific grounds. The grounds are also enumerated in the provision. Once the Legislature has devised such a safeguard in public interest and provided for pre grant opposition, so also, set out the manner in which the same has to be dealt with, then, we cannot place a narrow interpretation on the said provision so as to defeat the legislative mandate. The distinction made by Mr. Kadam that opportunity is restricted only to the contents of the original application and there is no requirement of giving further hearing; makes the exercise meaningless and it would be then very easy to defeat Section 25(1). In this context, it must be understood that the opposition under Section 25( 1) is to the \"grant of a patent\". The grant is on an application made in that behalf, which itself is duly published. If the opposition is raised to the grant, then, until the same is dealt with, no patent can be granted. If the original claim/application is amended, as in this case, and the amendments are also opposed, then, a personal hearing to the objector on the amended claims is required to be given if specifically requested.

Once we find that the statutory mandate has been breached and violated, then, the Respondent No. 1 will suffer prejudice if the clock has to be set back, is indeed no answer. Mr. Kadam then submits that we should not set aside the grant even if we conclude that the same is issued without adherence to the principles of natural justice. In other words, while remitting the matter back to the Patent Controller we should not disturb the patent granted in favour of the Respondent No.1 because that would have serious consequences on the trade operations. We are unable to accede to this request.

Having considered the rival submissions, we would deal with the last objection first. Although the Petitioners may have remedy of post grant opposition or of seeking suo moto revocation as well as filing of a counter claim as is suggested by the Respondents that by itself can be no basis to non-suit the Petitioners, if the Petitioners were right in their grievance that the authority has committed manifest or jurisdictional error while considering the representation by way of opposition or for that matter decided the objections on palpable misreading and misapplication of the relevant provisions of law. This is so because the law provides for remedy of pre-grant opposition by virtue of Section 25(1) of the Act. If such a remedy is provided, the authority is obliged to consider the representation by way of pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1) keeping in mind the parameters of law by observing principles of natural justice. It is not necessary for us to examine the argument of the Petitioners that the remedy of pre-grant opposition is qualitatively different than the remedy of post-grant opposition. According to the Petitioners, in the pre-grant opposition, the onus is on the patent applicant to show that the alleged invention would result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance; whereas in the post-grant opposition, the onus will be on the objector to show that the alleged invention does not result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance. Suffice it to observe that the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent No. 1 does not mean that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the decision of the authority on the opposition under Section 25(1) of the Act. It is a matter of prudence and discretion as to whether the Court should entertain the writ petition or not.

After taking into consideration the rival submissions, in our view, prima facie case is made out for grant of interim relief by the Petitioner. It is an admitted position that after preliminary hearing was given to Respondent No.4 under sections 14 and 15, a publication was made under section 11A (3) of the said Act on 15/8/2008. The First Examination Report was issued by the Indian Patent Office under sections 12 and 13 on 20/10/2010 and the Petitioner thereafter filed representation by way of opposition  under section 25(1) on 7/4/2011. Thereafter, various applications for amendment were made by Respondent No.4. It is alleged that no hearing was given to the Petitioner when the amendment applications were allowed and even thereafter the Petitioner was not given an opportunity of being heard in respect of the said four amendment applications. During the period between the filing of application and grant of patent, Respondent No.4 applied for four amendments, as follows:- It is an admitted position that after 13/12/2011, no further hearing has been given to the Petitioner. Office of Respondent No.3 wrote a letter dated 24/12/12 and para 1 and 2 of the said letter it has been mentioned as under:- “27. The question to be asked in the ultimate analysis would be whether the person aggrieved was given a fair deal by the authority or not? Could a reasonable person, under the circumstances in which Tribunal was placed, pass such an order? Answer to these questions would determine the fate of the case.”  In the present case, after 13th December, 2011, further hearing was given to the applicant. They were permitted to rely on additional affidavit, however, no opportunity was given to the Petitioner to give their say and they were not heard. Similarly on the two crucial amendments viz (ii) and (iv), no opportunity was given to the Petitioner to give their reply nor were they heard. Ratio of these judgments, therefore, would squarely apply to the facts of the present case and, therefore, in our view, prim facie there is clear breach of principles of natural justice.",

It is seen that the Plaintiff has amended IN'429 on four occasions during the examination and oppositions process. The consistent view of the Controller, except in order dated 24th October, 2009 which is no longer in operation, has been that the said amendments were well within the scope of the originally filed claims and the Plaintiff only sought to restrict the claims and not broaden them. The view having been that the amendments are in accordance with Section 59 of the Patents Act, 1970, the mere fact that the Plaintiff has amended the claims would not weigh against the Plaintiff. It is usual for patent applicants to edit, amend, modify and vary the claims during the examination and opposition process.

The process sought to be claimed in the amended claims has been clearly disclosed in the patent specification. The said process is not sought to be added newly by way of an amendment. The amendment is, thus, within the scope of the patent specification and claims as originally filed. In the opinion of the Court, the amended claims of the Appellant satisfy the conditions of Section 59(1) of the Act as specified above. Thus, the objection under Section 59(1) of the Act is not sustainable.”",

In Best Agrolife Limited (supra) the impugned order was set aside not only because of an amendment but also on merits. It was held the impugned order was a) without any reasoning and b) the scope of claim was  increased in the amendment as range of thickness was increased from 0.025-05% to 0.05-0.25%. However, the scope of the claims in this case has rather been reduced/merged. Hence to my mind no prejudice is caused to the petitioner with reduced claim from nos.1-25 to 1-19.",

Everything depends on the subject-matter, the application of principles of natural justice, resting as it does upon statutory implication, must always be in conformity with the scheme of the Act and with the subject-matter of the case. In the application of the concept of fair play there must be real flexibility. There must also have been some real prejudice to the complainant; there is no such thing as a merely technical infringement of natural justice. The requirements of natural justice must depend on the facts and the circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-matter to be dealt with, and so forth.”",

The procedure commences with the filing of an application. The second step contemplates publication of the details of the patent sought. The next step envisages, the filing of representations by way of opposition (to the grant of the patent). This advances into a determination by the “Controller”, to grant or refuse the patent. The decision of the “Controller”, leads to the publication of the grant (of the patent). This process finalises the decision of the grant of the patent. All the same, it does not finally crystalise, the right of the patent holder. After the grant is published, “any person interested”, can issue a notice of opposition, within one year of the date of publication of the grant of a patent. If and when, challenges raised to the grant of a patent are disposed of favourably, to the advantage of the patent holder, the right to hold the patent can then and then alone, be stated to have crystallized. Likewise, if no notice of opposition is preferred, within one year of the date of publication  of the grant of a patent, the grant would be deemed to have crystallized. Thus, only the culmination of procedure contemplated under Section 25(2) of the Patents Act, bestows the final approval to the patent. Therefore, it is unlikely and quite impossible, that an “infringement suit” would be filed, while the proceedings under Section 25(2) are pending, or within a year of the date of publication of the grant of a patent.”",
