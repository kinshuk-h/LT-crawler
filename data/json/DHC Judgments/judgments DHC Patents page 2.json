After considering the entire matter, the Court had directed as under:- i.  The delay in filing of oppositions by all four Petitioners in respect of the applications which they intend to oppose as set out above, is condoned. They shall now file their oppositions by 31st March, 2022, either online or offline. The same shall be registered by the Trademark Registry by 10th April, 2022, and notices shall be issued to the concerned trademark applicants. The oppositions shall thereafter proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Trademarks Act and the Rules there under.  ii.  The registration certificates that may have been issued to the trademark applicants in W.P.(C) IPD 88/2021, W.P. (C) IPD 103/2021 & W.P.(C) 1907/2022 shall stand suspended during this period, till the decision is taken on the oppositions, as specified herein.  iii.  In W.P.(C) IPD 4/2022, the registration certificate shall not be issued to the Applicant, till the decision is taken on the oppositions, as specified herein.  iv.  In so far as other trademarks advertised during the pandemic are concerned, the advertised application in respect of which the four month limitation period would have expired after 15th March, 2020, the limitation period in terms of the orders of the Supreme Court shall be extended for filing oppositions to the said applications, until the expiry of 90 days from 1st March, 2022, i.e. till 30th May, 2022. Compliance of this direction shall be ensured by the respective Controllers in-charge of Oppositions across the five offices of CGPDTM, in case any emails are received by prospective opponents/ their agents/ counsels who wish to file oppositions. During this period, if any email is received by the CGPDTM from the opponents/their agents/counsels, the office of the CGPDTM shall enable the said opposition to be filed either through online mechanism or through physical filing. Upon filing of oppositions, the status of the trademark application shall be reflected appropriately on the portal within 48 hours.  v.  Insofar as trademark registration certificates which may have been issued during the pandemic period, the registration certificates shall be dealt with in the following manner:  a.  In respect of the trademark applications in which no oppositions have been already filed or are received till 30th May, 2022, the said registration certificates shall remain valid and the said applicants shall enjoy their statutory rights in accordance with law.  b.  In respect of those trademark applications where oppositions have already been filed or are filed by 30th May, 2022, the registration certificates shall either not be issued or if already issued, the same shall stand suspended till the oppositions are decided by the office of the CGPDTM.  vi.  In future, whenever emails concerning oppositions are received by the Opposition Section, CGPDTM, the concerned Controller in-charge shall first, ensure that such emails are replied to within a reasonable time, not later than three working days and second, that proper instructions are given by them to the section issuing registration certificates at the CGPDTM/ concerned officials in the Mumbai office, depending upon the correspondence received, so that certificates are not issued while issues relating to opposing the trademark are being raised with the office of the CGPDTM.”",

Counsel appearing for the Appellant submits that all the initial objections which were raised in the FER were satisfied and the only new objection which was raised in the hearing notice was in respect of Section 3(d) of the Act.

It is true that it is the patentee who must prove the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of his invention. But in a revocation the applicant must plead and prove that it is hit by S.3(d) and that it has the same therapeutic efficacy as the known substance. Then the respondent will counter it either by proving that it is not a derivative of a known substance or by proving that though it is only a new form of a known substance he has shown that it has enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In the present case, there are no such pleadings. It is not enough to plead that because Ex1 and 2 are admitted prior arts, this is only a new form of those compounds. That is vague. It is only when the pleadings show how the invention is one kind of a derivative of known substance the patentee will have to explain how the grant of patent is justified because of the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy. In this case the pleadings are not adequate. We hold that the S.3(d) ground has not been proved.”",

Though not in the context of a patent office objection, the observations would be relevant to examine as to how the objection under Section 3(d) is to be raised. Section 3(d) bars patentability of a `new form’ of `a known substance’, without establishing enhanced therapeutic efficacy. For the said objection to be raised, the basic pre-condition would be the identification of the `a known substance’. The said `known substance’ could be one substance or a compound/s derived from a Markush formula. However, it has to be identified. It cannot be left to the Applicant to deduce as to what is the known substance and thereafter give efficacy data qua that known substance, based on the said deduction. It is only new forms of substances which are derived from the same known substance that would attract the rigors of Section 3(d). However, in this case, the compound which constitutes the `known substance’ was not identified in the hearing notice. For the purposes of a Section 3(d) objection, the one specific known substance is to be identified and the manner in which the claimed compounds are ‘new forms’ ought to be mentioned by the Patent Office, even if not in detail but at least in a brief manner. The hearing notice does not mention so.",

                        "content": "On behalf of Telegram, Mr. Sibal, ld. Senior Counsel, submits that:  (i)  The interim arrangement which is already in place directing Telegram to take down the impugned channels is sufficient to protect the interest of the Plaintiffs.  (ii)  As per the Privacy Policy of Telegram, Clause 8.3 is clear that until and unless a person is expected to be a terror suspect, the disclosure of the subscriber information cannot be made. The said clause reads as under:  “8.3. Law Enforcement Authorities  If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities. So far, this has never happened. When it does, we will include it in a semi-annual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.”  (iii)  He further relies upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India & Ors., (2017) 10 SCC 1, paragraphs 310 and 328, to argue that unless and until a  law requires disclosure of such information, it is not permissible to direct disclosure of the same inasmuch as the privacy of the person operating the said channel would be protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  (iv)  Post the judgment of Puttaswamy (supra), it is submitted that the Government has enacted the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics, 2021 (hereinafter “IT Guidelines”), which is also relied upon by Telegram. Specific reliance is placed on Rule 3(1)(d) of the IT Guidelines, which primarily requires the intermediary to take down or remove or disable access to the unlawful information. Further, on the basis of Rule 4 of the IT Guidelines, it is argued that unless and until, any one of the situations as contemplated in the first proviso to Rule 4(1)(2) of the said guidelines is satisfied, even a Court order cannot be passed directing disclosure of the basic subscriber information.  (v)  Vehement reliance is also placed on the fact that Telegram has its servers based in Singapore which has encrypted data. Accordingly, decryption of that data would not be permissible except as per the laws of Singapore. Reliance is placed upon the Personal Data Protection Act, 2012, of Singapore (hereinafter “PDPA”), specifically, on the definitions relating to “personal data proceedings” under Sections 17 and 29 of the PDPA read with Schedule IV. He submits that while under Section 17 of the PDPA, Telegram may reveal certain information upon direction by a “Court”, since the “Court” in terms of the Interpretation Act  of Singapore, 1965, would only mean a Court based in Singapore, a Court in India would not be empowered to direct disclosure of the information relating to the subscriber who may be running the allegedly infringing channels.  (vi)  Finally, Section 72A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (hereinafter “IT Act”), is stressed upon, which provides that any disclosure of information in breach of a lawful contract i.e., the contract between the Telegram platform and the subscriber/ creator of the impugned channels, would also be contrary to law and could constitute an offence.",

Telegram shall continue to remove infringing content as may be reported by the Plaintiffs.  (ii)  The data centres and servers of Telegram are located outside India and the direction for disclosure would violate the laws of the jurisdiction where the servers are located. Moreover, Telegram uses a distributed physical infrastructure and is bound by the provisions of the PDPA, Singapore.  (iii)  Telegram itself is a Dubai-based company and is bound by the laws of Dubai.  (iv)  In any event, Telegram is an ‘intermediary’, which is only expected to act as per the IT Act and IT Guidelines. Such an intermediary only has to remove the infringing content upon being given notice and is not liable for third party information circulated on its platform.  (v)  In case Telegram discloses such personal data, it might be in breach of Section 72A of the IT Act, which makes unauthorised disclosure of information in breach of a contract, a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment for a term that may extend to three years.  (vi)  There is no proof of infringement of copyright produced before the Court, and even the current impugned channels have been removed in good faith. However, the order dated 28th July, 2020 was passed on the understanding that the Plaintiffs would provide verifiable proof of the channels sought to be removed.  (vii)  There is no valid ground for directing discovery, as the Plaintiffs have not proven how the private user data sought to be disclosed is material or relevant to the present suit’s adjudication, as required by the CPC.

(v)  Clause 1.1 provides that the user’s data is not stored for the purpose of showing ads or commercial purposes. However, advertisers can promote their services through various public one-to-many channels.  (vi)  Data up to 100 MB can be stored in the device and all media can be kept in the cloud.  (vii)  All the messages, photos, videos and documents of/for a user are stored on the cloud chat so that a user would be able to access the same from any device. Thus, the Telegram app content does not need to be backed up on any external/third-party backup.  (viii)  Clause 3.3.4 provides that apart from private messages, public channels and groups are also enabled on Telegram. All the public chats are cloud chats. Though this data of public chats is also encrypted, both in storage and transit, since the content is posted publicly, it is accessible to all users.  (ix)  The Telegram app as per Clause 3.3.2, permits secret chats, which can be decrypted only by the devices they were sent to or from. Such chats also use end-to-end encryption.  (x)  Clause 7.2 notes that credit card information submitted through payment gateways for premium services is not made available to Telegram and the said data is not stored.  (xi)  Clause 9.3 notes that minimal data may be required for the Telegram application to function in a secured manner.  (xii)  Clause 2 provides that the data collected is processed to further Telegram’s legitimate interest, including for the provision of effective and innovative services, detection, prevention of fraudulent activities, and security related concerns.  (xiii)  As per clause 2 of the Privacy Policy, processing of personal data is done unless the user’s overriding interest is to be protected or the fundamental rights mandate protection of the personal data.  The relevant clause is as under:  “We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.”  (xiv)  A section of the Privacy Policy deals with the rights of the user in respect of personal data under Clause 9.1. If a user wishes to seek deletion or a copy of the data, amendment of the data, object to the processing of the data and correct any data or lodge a complaint with the National Data Protection Authority, a specific link has been provided for contacting Telegram.  (xv)  Clause 4 provides that the data centres where the data is stored are geographically located in different jurisdictions. Location data can also be stored either on cloud or on secret chats.  (xvi)  The servers for the EEA or UK are located in the data centres in Netherlands.  (xvii)  Clause 8.2 provides that Telegram may share a user’s personal data with its parent company, Telegram Group Inc. in the British Virgin Islands and Telegram FZ-LLC a group member in Dubai, to provide, improve and support its services. It notes that appropriate safeguards as per a European Commission approved agreement between Telegram and its group companies, will be implemented during such data sharing.  (xviii)  Clause 5.2 provides that for the purpose of safety and security, to prevent spam, abuse and other violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, Telegram may collect metadata such as IP address of the user, devices used by the user, history of username changes, etc. Such data can be stored for 12 months.  (xix)  Clause 5.3 notes that spamming, phishing and other kind of abuse is barred on Telegram. If there is a report of spam, which is confirmed by Telegram’s moderators, temporary or permanent disablement can take place. The account may also be finally banned. In order to stop spamming and phishing, Telegram can also use automated algorithms to analyse messages.  (xx)  Clause 8.3 provides that if Telegram receives a court order that confirms someone is a terror suspect, it may disclose such user’s IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.  (xxi)  “Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. What do I do?  All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them.

It is, in fact, a cognizable offence, as recently upheld by the Supreme Court in M/s Knit Pro International v. The State of NCT of Delhi & Anr. [Crl. Appl. No. 807 of 2022, decided on 20th May, 2022]. The relevant extract of the said decision reads as under:  “5.3 Thus, for the offence under Section 63 of the Copyright Act, the punishment provided is imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to three years and with fine. Therefore, the maximum punishment which can be imposed would be three years. Therefore, the learned Magistrate may sentence the accused for a period of three years also. In that view of the matter considering Part II of the First Schedule of the Cr.P.C., if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for three years and onwards but not more than seven years the offence is a cognizable offence. Only in a case where the offence is punishable for imprisonment  for less than three years or with fine only the offence can be said to be non-cognizable. In view of the above clear position of law, the decision in the case of Rakesh Kumar Paul (supra) relied upon by learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent no.2 shall not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand.

The significance of the protection and enforcement of such rights cannot be diminished, merely due to the growth of technology, which has made infringers easy to hide and conceal their illegal activities. The propensity of infringers to conceal and hide is the very reason due to which the provisions of law are widely worded. The definition of “plate” includes “any device used for reproducing copies of the work.” The definition of “infringing copy”, as extracted above, is broad enough to cover electronic copies which are circulated on Telegram channels. Electronic devices including smart phones, computers, servers, and such other devices, which permit copies to be made and to be disseminated would undoubtedly fall within the said definitions. This is also clear from the fact that Section 14(1)(a) specifically includes reproduction by “electronic  means.” It is thus clear that the devices of the channel operators, which are permitting and enabling such dissemination and communication, would constitute “plates” within Section 2(t) of the Act and they would constitute “duplicating equipment”. Therefore, both civil and criminal Courts in India would always be vested with jurisdiction to adequately deal with dissemination of infringing material through such devices and merely because the messaging service has its server located abroad, the same cannot result in the infringer escaping from the consequences of infringement. All contentions to the contrary would be untenable.",

                        "content": "Moreover, apart from an injunction, one of the most significant remedies that an IP owner or a copyright owner is vested with, is the right to claim damages. Such damages, especially in cases of infringers who are earning large sums to the detriment and at the cost of the copyright owner, acts as a deterrent against further infringement. If infringers are permitted to mask their identity through technological means provided by messaging apps, and their identity is not directed to be disclosed, the remedy of damages against infringement would be rendered completely nugatory. Under Section 55 of the Copyright Act, the owner has a right to seek damages as also accounts of profits. Accordingly, the grant of injunction per se in the absence of commensurate damages or monetary deterrents, would be a toothless relief. Such orders do not constrain the infringers from simply creating new infringing channels and even profit off of their infringement, till the time the plaintiff is able to seek an injunction for every new channel. As discussed above, the broadly worded provisions of the Copyright Act indicate a conscious legislative mandate to eliminate undue and continuous harassment  of plaintiffs in such situations where they have to repeatedly seek blocking orders against infringing channels. Thus, unless and until the identity of the operators of these channels – who are ex facie infringers of the Plaintiffs’ copyright – are disclosed, the Plaintiffs are rendered remediless for recovering damages. ‘Take down’ or blocking orders are merely token relief for the interregnum and without monetary relief of damages, coupled with mushrooming of infringing platforms, the copyright owner’s spirit to create and write may be considerably negated. The protection of the same is integral to the public policy behind the legislation as well. The legislative intention to prevent such continued infringement and effectively implement the provisions of the Copyright Act would be frustrated by any interpretation to the contrary.",

                        "content": "This brings the Court to the defences taken by Telegram in its response to the prayer for disclosure. In this regard, this Court finds as under:  (i)  In respect of Telegram’s data centre being located in Singapore and it being unable to disclose the details of the devices used, mobile number used, IP addresses etc., of the infringers -It is a fact of which judicial notice can be taken that Telegram is one of the most popular messaging applications in India. Its subscription base runs into millions of users and by merely locating its servers abroad, it cannot escape the rigours of orders passed by competent Courts in India. Indian courts would be the natural forum of jurisdiction in this dispute, in view of the following factors:  a.  The infringement unabashedly continuing within India, in order to protect the rights of copyright owners, Courts in India would be entitled to pass such orders as are effective and required for enforcement of the copyright owners’ rights;  b.  Since the copyrighted material is related to Indian examination materials, in all likelihood the source of the infringing channels being in India, the accounts of such  infringing channels would have been created from India and the data of such accounts would have been uploaded from India;  c.  Telegram has not made any averment in the reply filed by it that the devices used in circulating the infringing material are not located in India. It is only the data of such channels and devices, that is claimed to be not located in India. Considering that the Plaintiffs’ work relates to competitive examinations in India, it is nigh possible that the devices circulating the infringing content and the persons running the infringing platforms and channels are located in India. Even if some devices and the persons controlling the same are not in India, insofar as Indian law is concerned, the devices/equipment/network from which the transmission originates and the owners of such channels/devices, within India would be relevant.  d.  Cloud computing being the norm these days, as also pointed out by Telegram in its Privacy Policy at Clause 4, even if the data is stored in a physical structure outside India, the same is accessible to the company in other jurisdictions including from India. Telegram itself also states at Clause 8.2 that the data is shared among Telegram’s group companies in Dubai and British Virgin Islands. Therefore, the data is accessible across different jurisdictions, including India and the conventional concepts of territoriality no longer exist, such that  locating the physical server outside India would divest Indian Courts of their powers.  e.  In any case, it is also relevant to note that Telegram is actively making its services available in India and now even earning revenue from India, by its Premium services. In this regard, under the IT Guidelines 2021 relied upon by Telegram relies upon, there is an obligation on it to appoint necessary grievance officer(s) in India.  f.  Finally, this Court also notes the Supreme Court’s observations in Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres (India) (P) Ltd., (1996) 5 SCC 550 and Krishan Yadav v. State of Bihar, AIR 1994 SC 2166, where it has been repeatedly held that High Courts are vested with inherent powers to enable themselves to maintain their dignity, and secure obedience to their process and rules, i.e., and to give effective relief.  In view of all these factors, Courts in India would be perfectly justified in directing Telegram, which runs its massive operations in India to adhere to Indian law and adhere to orders passed by Indian Courts for disclosure of relevant information relating to infringers. Infringers cannot be permitted to seek shelter under Telegram’s policies merely on the ground that its physical server is in Singapore.  (ii)  In so far as the law in Singapore is concerned, the provisions of the PDPA, in fact, specifically recognize violations of law, as being an  exception to privacy, when details of the originators of the infringing data can be revealed. Such violation of law and investigation/proceedings, would obviously include violation of copyright and other intellectual property rights. The relevant provision of the PDPA of Singapore reads:  “17. Collection, use and disclosure without consent  (1)   An organisation may —  (a)  collect personal data about an individual, without the individual’s consent or from a source other than the individual, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in the First Schedule or Part 1 of the Second Schedule;  (b)  use personal data about an individual without the individual’s consent, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in  the First Schedule or Part 2 of the Second Schedule; or  (c)  disclose personal data about an individual without the individual’s consent, in the circumstances or for the purposes, and subject to any condition, in the First Schedule or Part 3 of the Second Schedule.  …  FIRST SCHEDULE  PART 3  LEGITIMATE INTERESTS  …",

(iii)  Moreover, copyrighted works are entitled to automatic protection in all WTO countries under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 1886 read with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), 1995. The Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works are no exception to that. Article 1 of the said Convention provides as under:  The countries to which this Convention applies constitute a Union for the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works.”  Singapore is a signatory to the Berne convention and a WTO country as well. Thus, the Plaintiffs’ works would enjoy protection even under the laws of Singapore. These are reciprocal protections granted to authors who can enjoy rights across the world even without seeking registrations. India recognizes copyright in foreign works and reciprocally, foreign countries recognize the copyright granted under Indian Law. In view of this position of the law regarding copyright, compliance with local law, i.e., PDPA, cannot be an excuse for Telegram to justify the non-furnishing of the information relating to the channels through which dissemination of infringing content takes place as, such dissemination, would in  the opinion of this Court, be violative of law, even under the laws of Singapore.  (iv)  In respect of Telegram’s submission of it being an intermediary, and being obliged to not disclose the details of the originator of the information, in the opinion of this Court, merely disabling or taking down channels upon information being given to Telegram is an insufficient remedy, as also discussed in paragraph 39 above. The channels are clearly hydra-headed and are surfacing one after the other owing to the ease with which they can be created, with just another mobile number or email address.  (v)  Telegram has also relied upon Rules 3 and 4 of the IT Guidelines. The said Rules read as under:  “Rule 3 (1) Due diligence by an intermediary: An intermediary, including social media intermediary and significant social media intermediary, shall observe the following due diligence while discharging its duties, namely:— (d) an intermediary, on whose computer resource the information is stored, hosted or published, upon receiving actual knowledge in the form of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction or on being notified by the Appropriate Government or its agency under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 79 of the Act, shall not host, store or publish any unlawful information, which is prohibited under any law for the time being in force in relation to the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India; security of the State; friendly relations with foreign States; public order; decency or morality; in relation to contempt of court; defamation; incitement to an offence relating to the above, or any information which is prohibited under any law for the time being in force:  Provided that any notification made by the Appropriate Government or its agency in relation to any information which is prohibited under any law for the time being in force shall be issued by an authorised agency, as may be notified by the Appropriate Government:  Provided further that if any such information is hosted, stored or published, the intermediary shall remove or disable access to that information, as early as possible, but in no case later than thirty-six hours from the receipt of the court order or on being notified by the Appropriate Government or its agency, as the case may be:  Provided also that the removal or disabling of access to any information, data or communication link within the categories of information specified under this clause, under clause (b) on a voluntary basis, or on the basis of grievances received under sub-rule (2) by such intermediary, shall not amount to a violation of the conditions of clauses (a) or (b) of sub-section (2) of section 79 of the Act;  XXX  …  (2) A significant social media intermediary providing services primarily in the nature of messaging shall enable the identification of the first originator of the information on its computer resource as may be required by a judicial order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction or an order passed under section 69 by the Competent Authority as per the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for interception, monitoring and decryption of  information) Rules, 2009, which shall be supported with a copy of such information in electronic form:  Provided that an order shall only be passed for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of an offence related to the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, or public order, or of incitement to an offence relating to the above or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material, punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years:  Provided further that no order shall be passed in cases where other less intrusive means are effective in identifying the originator of the information:  Provided also that in complying with an order for identification of the first originator, no significant social media intermediary shall be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message, any other information related to the first originator, or any information related to its other users:  Provided also that where the first originator of any information on the computer resource of an intermediary is located outside the territory of India, the first originator of that information within the territory of India shall be deemed to be the first originator of the information for the purpose of this clause.”  The above IT Guidelines are specific guidelines, which are provided in respect of “significant social media intermediaries” and the due diligence to be adhered to by them. These guidelines do not in any manner obviate the duty of Telegram as a platform to take all effective steps required to protect IP rights, including rights of  copyright owners. This was also noted by the ld. Division Bench of this court in My Space Inc. v. Super Cassettes Industries Ltd., (2017) 236 DLT 478 (DB). The Court therein held as under:  “47. In this Court's opinion, Section 79 grants a measured privilege to an intermediary. However, that would not mean that the rights guaranteed under the Copyright Act are in any manner curtailed. All Section 79 does is regulates the liability in respect of intermediaries while the Copyright Act grants and controls rights of a copyright owner. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to conceive how one would pose a barrier in the applicability of the other. The true intent of Section 79 is to ensure that in terms of globally accepted standards of intermediary liabilities and to further digital trade and economy, an intermediary is granted certain protections. Section 79 is neither an enforcement provision nor does it list out any penal consequences for non-compliance. It sets up a scheme where intermediaries have to follow certain minimum standards to avoid liability; it provides for an affirmative defence and not a blanket immunity from liability.”  (vi)  As held in Myspace (supra), the intermediary is to be granted safe harbour, so long as it complies with the requirements of law. In the present case, the infringement has to be nipped in the bud, without which Courts would have to continue to repeatedly pass injunction orders against mushrooming channels containing infringing content. The Court cannot perpetually supervise such infringements and, thus, the origin and source of the infringing material has to be traced and such devices or persons involved in the infringement  ought to face consequences in accordance with law, including being held liable for damages. That would not be possible if the source of such infringing copies, i.e., the details of the infringing channels are not disclosed. Pertinently, such production of details of infringing devices or persons or other sources, is not a comment on Telegram’s liability and does not derogate from safe harbour provisions. In fact, it is aligned with the view of Telegram’s claimed role as an intermediary, which claims to act as a conduit of information.  (vii)  Disclosure of such information is relevant and material to the present case, contrary to what is pleaded by Telegram in its reply. Even applying the broad principles of Order XI CPC, the Court can direct disclosure of documents and information relating to ‘any matter in question in a suit’. The Delhi High Court in A.K. Aggarwal v. Shanti Devi [CM(M) Appeal No.154 and 155 of 1995, decided on 17th October, 1995], held that seeking interrogatories must be encouraged:  “4. Order XI of the CPC, contains salutary provision which are intended to curtail evidence thereby expediting trial of suit and as such their provisions are very useful. They have to be liberally used and parties have to be encouraged to use them in the course of trial. The provision of Order XI, Civil Procedure Code do not deserve a technical or truncated approach. Ultimately the use of these provisions saves time of the Court and costs of litigation to the parties. \"Jessel M.R. in Attorney-General vs. Gashill (1882) 20 Ch. 519, said: \"Now, one of the great objects of interrogatories when properly administered has always been to save evidence, that is to diminish  the burden of proof which was otherwise on the plaintiff. Their object is not merely to discover facts which will inform the plaintiff as to evidence to be obtained, but also to save the expense of proving a part on the case. Cotton L.T., J, said: Interrogatories are “not limited to giving the plaintiff a knowledge on that which he does not already know but include the getting an admission of anything which he has to prove on any issue which is raised between him and the defendant.” (5) My attention has been drawn to a judgment of this Court in 0. S. No. 4 & 5 of 15730 entitled Suresh Chand vs. KM. Vinay Devi etc. decided on 14.9.73. Unfortunately I am informed that this judgment has not been reported though it is an illuminating judgment so far as the provisions of Order XI Civil Procedure Code . are concerned. I am in respectful agreement with the views expressed in the said judgment to quote : 'A party has a right to interrogate with a view to obtaining an admission from his opponent of everything which is material and relevant to the issue raised on the pleadings. The object is to obtain an admission from the opponent which will make the burden of proof easier than it otherwise would have been. The purpose is to get from the defendant an admission of that which no doubt he denied by his defense but not on oath. About the fact of the parentage of the appellant Suresh Chand a fact which is within the knowledge and an admission of it by him must obviously save enormous amount of expense at the trial. Lindley L. J. in the case of Attorney-General (supra) said : \"It is no reason for declining to answer the interrogatories to say that the same information may be got by cross-exam, at the trial\". If the appellants answer the question regarding parentage and the Will of the deceased Thakur Dass, the plaintiff would be  relieved of the obligation to prove to that extent. She will not be required to call witnesses. She will save great expenditure and trouble if these interrogatories are answered. It may possibly happen that the plaintiff will find that she has no need to call any witnesses. In short interrogatories are admissible which go to support the applicant's case or to impeach or destroy the opponent's case Plymouth Mutual Co-op. Society vs. Traders Publishing Association (1906) 1 LJ. 415. This means that the right to interrogate is not confined to the facts the existence or non-existence of which is relevant to the facts already in issue (per Lord Esher. M.K. in Marriot vs. Chamberlain ( 1886) QBD. 154. In the case of Suthurland (Duke) v. British Dominions Land Settlement Corporation. 1926 1 C.H. 746, Mr. Justice Tomlin said that the administering of interrogatories is a step which is more often desirable than undesirable and is to be encouraged rather than to be discouraged, because they not infrequently bring an action to an end at an earlier stage than otherwise would be the case, to the advantage of all parties concerned. …”  (viii)  This position was also most recently reiterated in Tara Batra v. Punam  A.  Kumar & Ors. [CM(M)No. 925/2019, decided on 10th September, 2021] by a Coordinate Bench of this Court. In the present suit, the most important information is the details relating to the origin of the infringing copies of the copyrighted works.  (ix)  Even under the provisions of the IT Act, such as under Section 79(3)(b), Telegram has a duty to expeditiously remove or disable access to the unlawful material, without vitiating the evidence in any manner. In addition, under Rule 3 of the IT Guidelines, the intermediary has a duty  to tell its users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information, which infringes on copyright or other proprietary rights or violates any law. This is buttressed by the fact that under its own Privacy Policy, Telegram does not permit spamming, phishing and other abuses. Under such circumstances, as per clause 2 of its own Privacy Policy, fundamental rights would not come to the aid of protection of personal data related to the infringers, as it is only the “processing” of data, which can be stopped for protection of fundamental rights. Disclosure pursuant to an order passed by a Court of law of the details of the channel operators who are disseminating materials infringing the copyrighted works, or the devices and other gadgets used, cannot be shielded under the grounds of protection of privacy or protection of freedom of speech and expression. Disclosure of such data pursuant to a Court order would not fall in the definition of “processing”, which is the only activity that is restricted by the infringing users’ fundamental rights. Telegram’s own privacy policy does not recognize the defence, which has been canvassed before this Court.  (x)  Further reliance was placed by Telegram on the laws of privacy protection under Article 21 of the Constitution and Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which protects the right to freedom of speech and expression. The same is completely inapposite in these facts and circumstances. The right to freedom of speech or the right to life including the right to privacy cannot be used by any person or entity, let alone an infringer, in order to escape the consequences of illegal actions.  (xi)  In this vein, Telegram also relied upon the judgement of the Supreme Court in Puttaswamy (supra). The relevant extract of the said decision reads as under:  “310. While it intervenes to protect legitimate State interests, the State must nevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold requirement. These three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just informational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and content-based mandate of Article 21. The first requirement that there must be a law in existence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an express requirement of Article 21. For, no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential requirement. Second, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate State aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of reasonableness mandated by Article 14, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. The pursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial review does not reappreciate or second guess the value judgment of the legislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means which are adopted by the legislature are proportional to the object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against arbitrary State action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the encroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence, the threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual interdependence between the fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and  The right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is subject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.

                        "content": "Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to privacy in an age of information can originate not only from the State but from non-State actors as well. We commend to the Union Government the need to examine and put into place a robust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate concerns of the State. The legitimate aims of the State would include for instance protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits. These are matters of policy to be considered by the Union Government while designing a carefully structured regime for the protection of the data. Since the Union Government has informed the Court that it has constituted a Committee chaired by Hon'ble Shri Justice B.N. Srikrishna, former Judge of this Court, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with appropriately by the Union Government having due regard to what has been set out in this judgment.”  As per the above extract from K.S. Puttaswamy (supra) it is clear that the Supreme Court recognises that if there is a law in existence to justify the disclosure of information and there is a need for the disclosure considering the nature of encroachment of the right then privacy cannot be a ground to justify non-disclosure, so long as the same is not disproportionate. In India, the Copyright Act is clearly a law, which  requires “infringing copies” to be taken into custody. The Copyright Act recognizes the right of the copyright owner to claim damages and rendition of accounts in respect of such infringement. Secondly, whenever the data is sought for a legitimate purpose, and for curbing the violation of law, including infringement of copyright, the same would be in accordance with the legal position recognised in K.S.  (xii)  Finally, a perusal of the provisions of Section 81 of the IT Act shows that the provisions of the IT Act are supplemental to the provisions of the Copyright Act. The said provision reads as under:  “81. Act to have overriding effect.–The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.  Provided that nothing contained in this Act shall restrict any person from exercising any right conferred under the Copyright Act, 1957 (14 of 1957) or the Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970).”  The raison d’etre for the introduction of this proviso is in fact made clear in the Lok Sabha Debates when the provision was introduced and the Report of the Expert Committee pursuant to which the said provide was introduced. The said material clearly indicates that the purpose of the proviso to Section 81 was for the IT Act to be not in derogation of, but supplementary to the provisions of the Copyright Act. The relevant extract of the said debate is as under:7  “Clause 40.– This clause proposes to insert a proviso to Section 81 so that the rights conferred  under this section shall be supplementary to and not in derogation of the provisions of the copyright Act or the Patents Act.”  (xiii)  This position was also upheld by this Court in the context of a trademark infringement case against e-commerce platforms in Christian Louboutin Sas v. Nakul Bajaj &Ors., (2018) 253 DLT 728, where this Court held as under:  “78. Under Section 81 of the IT Act, the said Act is stipulated to have overriding effect. The provision reads as under: Section 81 -Act to have overriding effect.-The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. Provided that nothing contained in this Act shall restrict any person from exercising any right conferred under the Copyright Act 1957 or the Patents Act 1970.” 79. The overriding nature of the IT Act has application only if the provisions of the Trade Mark Act are inconsistent with the provisions of the IT Act. The Intermediary Guidelines 2011 themselves require compliance with the TM Act by the persons to host, display or upload the products or services. The provisions of Section 29, Section 101 and Section 102 of the TM Act, are being looked at in order to interpret as to what constitutes ‘conspiring, abetting, aiding or inducing’ the commission of an unlawful act, in the context of trade mark rights. The provisions of the TM Act are not in any manner inconsistent with the provisions of the IT Act. Hence Section 81 of the IT Act does not grant any immunity to intermediaries who may be in violation of the provisions of the TM  Act. While, use of a mark for any of the purposes elaborated above, in respect of genuine goods of the owner would not be infringement, the performance of any service as elaborated above, in respect of counterfeit goods or goods which are not genuine, could constitute infringement…..”  (xiv)  It is also worth noting that during the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers and the education system as a whole, have taken great initiative to ensure access of educational materials to students through online modes such as videos, PDF documents, etc. If the protection of copyright is not evolved as per the changing times, it would have a chilling effect on the progressive initiatives taken by educators in sharing their materials and ensuring accessibility.  (xv)  Lastly, in so far as Telegram’s submission regarding the Plaintiffs not providing verifiable proof that their copyright has been infringed are concerned, the Court notes that there is clear inconsistency between the stand of Telegram at different instances. While it states that proof of infringement is required, it has already blocked various infringing channels and abided by the order dated 28th July, 2020, without demanding further proof, including private channels. In any event, this Court has found a prima facie case of infringement, which is sufficient to direct Telegram to enable the Plaintiffs to available of their remedies under the Copyright Act.",

If such an argument is accepted, in the current world where most dissemination happens through online messaging services and platforms, IP violations would go completely unchecked. This cannot be the intention of law. The provisions of the IT Act and the Rules made therein have to be construed harmoniously with the rights and remedies provided to the copyright owners under the Copyright Act. Indian Courts are competent to decide issues relating to infringement of copyright and the mere fact that Telegram is operating a messaging service in India which chooses not to locate its servers in India cannot divest the Indian Courts from dealing with copyright disputes or divest copyright owners from availing their remedies in Indian Courts. In the present age of cloud computing and diminishing national boundaries in data storage, conventional concepts of territoriality cannot be strictly applied. The dynamic evolution of law is essential to ensure appropriate remedies in case of violation of copyright and other IP laws.  7 The Information Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2006, Bill No.96 of 2006, As introduced in the Lok Sabha, Dec 15, 2006.",

                        "content": "The Supreme Court thereafter held as under:  “12.8 The following undisputed facts emerge from the documents placed before the Tribunal. The authenticity of these documents were never in question or denied:  (i)  An agreement of a huge magnitude, for leasing out five numbers of C X S transponders each of 8.1  MHz capacity and five numbers of S X C transponders each of 2.7 MHz capacity on the Primary SatelliteI (PSI), was surprisingly and shockingly entered into by Antrix with Devas, without same being preceded by any auction/tender process. It appears from the letter dated 27.09.2004 sent by DEVAS LLC, USA to Shri K.R. Sridhara Murty, Executive Director of Antrix with copies to Dr. G. Madhavan Nair, Chairman, ISRO and others that Shri Ramachandran Viswanathan, met the then Chairman of ISRO and other officials in Bangalore in April 2003 and they met once again in Washington D.C. during the visit of the then Chairman of ISRO. These meetings, which were not preceded by any invitation to the public for any Expression of Interest, culminated in a Memorandum of Understanding dated 28.07.2003. Though it is not clear where the MoU was signed, there are indications that it was signed overseas;  (ii)  It must be noted here that a one man Committee comprising of Dr. B.N. Suresh, former Member of the Space Commission and Director of Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, was constituted on 8.12.2009, long after the commencement of the commercial relationship, to look comprehensively into all aspects of the contract, both commercial and technical. According to the Report submitted by him in May 2010, it was Forge Advisors, USA which made a presentation in March 2003, on technology aspects of digital multimedia services to Antrix/ISRO, followed by a presentation in May-2003  purportedly to the top management of Antrix/ ISRO. The MoU was signed thereafter;  (iii)  But the documents filed by the appellants themselves show that a power point presentation was made by Forge LLC on 22.03.2004, proposing an Indian joint venture to launch what came to be known as DEVAS (which perhaps ultimately turned out to be ASURAS). It was claimed in the said proposal that DEVAS platform will be capable of delivering multimedia and information services via satellite to mobile devices tailored to the needs of various market segments such as consumer segment, commercial segment and social segment. This presentation dated 22.03.2004 was followed by a proposal dated 15.04.2004, about which we have made a brief mention in paragraph 3.4 above. This proposal obliged ISRO/Antrix to invest in one operational S-band Satellite with a ground space segment to be leased to a joint venture between Forge and Antrix. What was to be reserved for the joint venture was 97% of the space. The consideration receivable by ISRO/ Antrix upon such a lease, was to be US $ 11 million annually for a period of 15 years. At least at this stage the proposal to invest in an operational S-band satellite and the lease of nearly the entire space of such satellite to a joint venture, should have come to the public domain, to see, (a) if the technology existed; and (b) if the proposal was commercially viable. But it was not done;  (iv)  On 14.05.2004, a Committee headed by one Dr. K.N. Shankara, Director, Space Applications Centre was constituted purportedly to examine the  technical feasibility, risk management including possibilities of alternate uses of space segment, financial and market aspects and time schedule. According to the Report submitted by this Committee, DEVAS was conceived as a new national service expected to be launched by the end of 2006 that would deliver video, multimedia and information services via high powered satellite to mobile receivers in vehicles and mobile phones across India. The catch here lies in the fact that while it was possible to deliver some of these services via terrestrial mode, it was not possible at that point of time to provide this bouquet of services via satellite. Even today satellite phones are beyond the reach of a common man. Mobile receivers or devices which can simply receive audio and video content are different from mobile phones, which are capable of providing a two way communication. The technology for providing the services through mobile phones was not in existence at that time, which is why the proposal made by Forge Advisors included an expectation that such a service may be launched by the end of 2006. It was with this expectation/promise that an Agreement was entered into on 28.01.2005 but this so-called new national service was never launched as promised in 2006. The launch of the services was not linked to the provision of a S-band satellite by Antrix, at least at the time when negotiations took place;  (v)  Admittedly, FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) approvals taken by Devas during the period May-2006 to September-2009 were on the basis of the ISP (Internet Service Provider) license  secured from the Department of Telecommunications on 02.05.2008 and IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) services license obtained on 31.03.2009;  (vi)  Therefore, the finding of the Tribunal, (a) that a public largesse was doled out in favour of Devas, in contravention of the public policy in India; (b) that Devas enticed Antrix/ISRO to enter into an MoU followed by an Agreement by promising to provide something that was not in existence at that time and which did not come into existence even later; (c) that the licenses and approvals were for completely different services; and (d) that the services offered were not within the scope of SATCOM Policy etc. are actually borne out by records;  (vii)  There is no denial of the fact that Devas offered a bouquet of services known as (a) Devas Services through a device called (b) Devas device in a hybrid mode of transmission, which is a combination of satellite and terrestrial transmissions, and which is called (c) Devas Technology but none of which existed at the relevant point of time or even thereafter;  (viii)  Devas did not even hold necessary intellectual property rights in this regard though they claimed to have applied;  (ix)  That the formation of the company, namely, Devas Multimedia Private Limited was for a fraudulent and unlawful purpose is borne out by the fact that the company was incorporated in December-2004,  as a result of preliminary meetings held at Bangalore in March-2003 and in USA in May-2003, followed by the signing of the MoU on 28.07.2003, the presentation made on 22.03.2004 and the discussions held thereafter. The ground work was clearly done during the period from March-2003 to December-2004 before the company was formally incorporated. Immediately after incorporation, the Agreement dated 28.01.2005 was signed. Therefore, the first ingredient of Section 271(c) of the Companies Act, 2013, namely, the formation of the company for a fraudulent and unlawful purpose was clearly made out;  (x)  The kind of licenses obtained such as ISP and IPTV licenses and the object for which FIPB approvals were taken but showcased as those sufficient for fulfilling the obligations under the Agreement dated 28.01.2005 demonstrated that the affairs of the company were conducted in a fraudulent manner. This is fortified by the fact that a total amount of Rs.579 crores was brought in, but almost 85% of the said amount was siphoned out of India, partly towards establishment of a subsidiary in the US, partly towards business support services and partly towards litigation expenses. We do not know if the amount of Rs.233 crores taken out of India towards litigation services, also became a part of the investment in a more productive venture, namely, arbitration. The manner in which a misleading note was put to the cabinet and the manner in which the minutes of the meeting of TAG subcommittee were manipulated, highlighted by the Tribunal, also shows that the  affairs of the company were conducted in a fraudulent manner. Thus, the second limb of Section 271(c), namely, the conduct of the affairs of the company in a fraudulent manner, also stood established.  (xi)  SATCOM Policy perceived telecommunication and broadcasting services to be independent of each other and also mutually exclusive. Therefore, a combination of both was not permitted by law. It is especially so since no deliberation took place with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Moreover, unless ICC allocates space segment, to a private player, the same becomes unlawful. This is why the conduct of the affairs of the company became unlawful;  (xii)  That the officials of the Department of Space and Antrix were in collusion and that it was a case of fence eating the crop (and also allowing others to eat the crop), by joining hands with third parties, is borne out by the fact that the Note of the 104th Space Commission did not contain a reference to the Agreement. The Cabinet Note dated 17.11.2005 prepared after ten months of signing of the Agreement, did not make a mention about Devas or the Agreement, but proceeded on the basis as though ISRO received several Expressions of Interest. These materials show the complicity of the officials to allow Devas to have unjust enrichment;  (xiii)  It is on record that the minutes of the meeting of the Sub Committee dated 06.01.2009 were manipulated and the experimental licence was  granted on 07.05.2009. Only thereafter, the original minutes were restored on 20.11.2009 and that too after protest.  (xiv)  Admittedly, every one of the investors procured shares of the company in liquidation and each shareholder had a representative in the board of directors. Since the board controlled the company, the directors were guilty of the conduct of the affairs of the company in a fraudulent manner. Since each shareholder had a representative in the board, the shareholders had to take the blame for the misdeeds of the directors;  (xv)  Additionally, the shareholders were fully aware of the fact that the application for approval dated 02.02.2006 to the FIPB was for ISP services. But they entered into a Share Subscription Agreement on 06.03.2006 for Devas services. The Share Subscription Agreement discloses that they were aware of the false statements contained in the Agreement dated 28.01.2005. Therefore, the shareholders, who now want to reap the fruits of a tree, fraudulently planted and unlawfully nurtured, cannot feign ignorance and escape the allegations of fraud.",

For a better understanding of the role ascribed to Courts in reviewing arbitral awards while considering applications filed under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, it would be relevant to refer to a judgment of this Court in Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] wherein R.F. Nariman, J. has in clear terms delineated the limited area for judicial interference,  taking into account the amendments brought about by the 2015 Amendment Act. The relevant passages of the judgment in Ssangyong [Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v.

DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204] i.e. the fundamental policy of Indian law would be relegated to “Renusagar” understanding of this expression.

However, the difficulty arises in applying the well-established principles for interference to the facts of each case that come up before the Courts. There is a disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards.

In other words, every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression “patent illegality”. Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as patent  - illegality. In addition, contravention of law not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of the expression “patent illegality”. What is prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible grounds for interference with a domestic award under Section 34(2A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based on no evidence or have been arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also, consideration of documents which are not supplied to the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the expression “patent illegality”.",

If a dispute which is not capable of settlement by arbitration is the subject-matter of the award or if the award is in conflict with public policy of India, the award is liable to be set aside. Explanation (1), amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, clarified the expression “public policy  of India” and its connotations for the purposes of reviewing arbitral awards. It has been made clear that an award would be in conflict with public policy of India only when it is induced or affected by fraud or corruption or is in violation of Section 75 or Section 81 of the 1996 Act, if it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law or if it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.",

NHAI, (2019) 15 SCC 131 : (2020) 2 SCC (Civ) 213] , this Court held that the meaning of the expression “fundamental policy of Indian law” would be in accordance with the understanding of this Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] . In Renusagar [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] , this Court observed that violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, a statute enacted for the “national economic interest”, and disregarding the superior Courts in India would be antithetical to the fundamental policy of Indian law. Contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest cannot be a ground to set at naught an arbitral award as being discordant with the fundamental policy of Indian law and neither can it be brought within the confines of “patent illegality” as discussed above. In other words, contravention of a statute only if it is linked to public policy or public interest is cause for setting aside the award as being at odds with the fundamental  policy of Indian law. If an arbitral award shocks the conscience of the court, it can be set aside as being in conflict with the most basic notions of justice. The ground of morality in this context has been interpreted by this Court to encompass awards involving elements of sexual morality, such as prostitution, or awards seeking to validate agreements which are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day.

Admittedly, there is huge difference in the prices of the medicines. The composition are totally similar as reflected clearly on the boxes. However, the maximum retail price over the medicine of the plaintiff is reflected as Rs.187.80/-, whereas the medicine of the defendant, costs Rs.60/-which is more than thrice of the defendant. Meaning thereby, the plaintiff intends to get enrichment at the cost of general public. The pronunciation of the trade mark i.e. LETERO and that of LETROZ is totally different. The names of both are also different.  It is beyond understanding as to how the plaintiff can stop the defendant from using Ist two alphabets when he himself is using all the 6 alphabets LETERO of the generic name i.e LETEROZOLE.

The drug in question is used for the treatment of brain cancer. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant•s marks, •TEMOKEM• and •TEMOGET• were deceptively similar to its trademarks and therefore, the defendant was required to be interdicted from using the said trademarks. The said contention was not accepted. It was held that the marks were not identical and there was no phonetic or visual similarity between them. The trademarks were derived from the drug •TEMOZOLOMIDE• and the suffix, •KEM• and •GET•, are entirely different and distinct from the suffix •DAL• and •DAR•. Both were Schedule H drugs and could be sold in retail but only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. The Court observed the fact that the product in question is a highly specialized drug and used for specific treatment of brain cancer was an important factor in considering whether the trademarks are deceptively similar and can cause confusion. The Court also took note of the fact that there was an immense price difference between the products of the appellant and that of the respondents.",

The relevant extract from the said decision is set out below:  •108. These may be some of the grounds for the appellants to fail in their action against the respondents, but these are not the only grounds why the Court would deny interim relief of injunction in cases like these. For the appellants to succeed, they must also establish that the respondents have no right to use the generic name/abbreviation of the compound •TEMOZOLOMIDE• in their drugs, and that the appellants have an exclusive right in this regard. This, unfortunately for the appellants, they have failed to show. In our view, for the appellants to fail it is enough that the appellants' trademark have been coined by combining the publici juris abbreviation TEM/TEMO for TEMOZOLOMIDE with the suffix •DAL• in one case and •DAR• in the other case, the marks of the appellants are descriptive, and the marks of the respondents do not bear phonetic or visual similarity which could be said to be deceptive or confusing for the purchasers of the drugs in question.",

In such appeals, the appellate court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of the court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except where the discretion has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had ignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of interlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion. After referring to these principles Gajendragadkar, J. in Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph [(1960) 3 SCR 713 : AIR 1960 SC 1156] : (SCR 721)  •... These principles are well established, but as has been observed by Viscount Simon in Charles Osenton & Co. v. Jhanaton [1942 AC 130] •...the law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of his discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is due only to the application of well settled principles in an individual case•.•  The appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this principle.•",

A perusal of the record shows that the present patent application bearing number 1312/DELNP/2014 was filed on 26th July, 2012 as a PCT application bearing no. PCT/US2012/048358 claiming priority from the U.S. patent application number 61/511,900 dated 26th July, 2011. Initially, the claims were amended to delete one claim in the PCT application. The Indian Patent Application No.1312/DELNP/2014  was filed on 20th February, 2014. The request for examination was filed by the Appellant under Rule 24B of the Patent Rules, 2003 on 30th October, 2014. The FER was issued by the Patent Office on 28th August, 2018 raising grounds of lack of novelty, inventive step in view of prior arts D1 & D2, and non-patentability under section 3(k) of the Act. After the reply dated 28th February, 2019 was filed by the Appellant to the FER, the hearing was conducted in December, 2020. Written Submissions dated 31st December, 2020 with an amended set of claims were filed with the Patent Office. Finally, vide the impugned order dated 8th August, 2021, the patent application of the Appellant has been rejected. The operative portion of the impugned order would be relevant and is set out below:  “4. In view of claims made in written submission following observations with respect to instant invention made :  The alleged invention is claiming a power charging system to a portable device i.e. battery and other devices that can be charged/receive power from the portable charged device.  Further the feature of the invention is to control such access between two devices on charging based upon some authentication which allow access to the portable device to get power to other device and that portable device can get power.  In view of these claims of the alleged invention the cited prior arts discloses all features of the alleged invention.  D3 discloses  Power transfer between devices such as laptop computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, media players and other devices is described. In an  embodiment power transfer is achieved either from a power source at a device or to a power source at that device using a bidirectional power transfer connector (paragraph [0005]).  The power source 206 can be an internal (or external) rechargeable battery, such as a Lithium Ion battery, Lithium Polymer battery or Nickel-Metal Hydride batter y(paragraph [0023]).  The device 200 may also include a power management module 210 which is arranged to control the transfer of power to or from particular connectors 212 or devices (paragraph [0026]).  The power transfer protocol 216 can also optionally carry out authentication and/or security checks 304. For example in the case of a peripheral device connected to a computing device the power transfer protocol may check whether or not the peripheral device is registered to the computing device and therefore allowed to share power. In the case of two peripheral devices the authentication may check that both devices are registered to the same person (paragraph [0036]).  Since both the features as claimed by the alleged invention are being disclosed by the cited prior art D3 alone, further features are not contributing to the inventive features in the instant invention.  Therefor in view of disclosures in the D1-D3 as explained above, all the features of the alleged invention is obvious and known; the instant invention fails to show any further inventive step.",

The permutations and combinations of the rings are so many and so broad that it is impossible to ascertain the actual scope of the invention.

The relevant portions of the impugned order are set out below:  “From above discussion and analysis of the As filed claims and Granted claims, conclusion can be drawn that to meet the requirements of the office action (FER and objections raised in hearing notice), applicant has dropped the claims having compounds where substituted amino acid side chain is present and retain three compounds wherein the substituted phenyl ethyl group retained and not substituted alpha amino acid moiety.  The objections related to distinctness or plurality were not raised correctly and only communicated the objections related to Novelty and Patentability u/s 3 with Hearing notice because all three compounds belong to same broad class of compounds and compositions thereof of parent application.  XXX XXX XXX  In other words, pharmaceutical vehicle is used for transportation/administration of single active compound (in present case), there is no role of vehicle in enhancement of therapeutic efficacy of the composition but remain same as of the efficacy of single active pharmaceutical ingredient and considered as compound of claim 1. The compound claimed in parent application is individual and independent claims as independent compound and belongs to same broad category based on the chemical structure where substituted alpha amino acid moiety is absent. However, as applicant tried to show chemical structure differences in his written submission the  chosen differences are not a valid reason for filing separate /further/ divisional application shown below. XXX XXX XXX If terminal groups of the claimed compounds could be the reason for filing the divisional application, in that condition the controller might not allow to grant such compounds in claims of parent application or applicant (himself his own desire) could have been filed three separate applications for all three granted compounds of parent application as three divisional applications but that is not the case. In view of above discussion it has been concluded that subject matter of compounds of granted claims of Parent application (8114/DELNP/2007) and subject matter of claims of instant application (7863/DELNP/2014) belong to same broad class and belong to [a] group of inventions linked so as to form a single inventive concept therefore instant application 7863/DELNP/2014 is not a valid divisional (further) application.”",

Counsel for the Appellant is that a perusal of two paragraphs of the impugned order shows that the Assistant Controller seeks to take the view that the objection of plurality of inventions raised in the first FER dated 15th May, 2013 issued in respect of the parent application was wrongly raised. Hence, the divisional application was itself wrongly filed and thus liable to be rejected. It is his submission that the Appellant cannot be made to suffer on both counts. Since the Patent Office had itself raised an objection that the original parent application contained a plurality of inventions, the Appellant filed a divisional application. In any event, there is no prejudice being caused inasmuch as the  claims of the divisional applications were part of the original parent application and the term of the divisional runs concurrently with the parent application under Section 16 of the Act. Thus, no additional protection is being given to the Appellant. However, qua the pharmaceutical compositions covered by the divisional application, the time of exclusivity is lapsing and therefore the Appellant’s interest is being detrimentally affected. Reliance is place upon the two judgments of the IPAB in OA/21/2022/PT/DEL titled National Institute of Immunology v. The Asst.

A comparative chart of the compounds claimed in the divisional application and the parent application is as follows:  Therefore, the terminal group as claimed in the divisional application would not constitute a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle of the compounds granted in claims 1 to 3 of the parent application. If the Markush claim was retained in the claims of the parent application and were  granted, then there would be no doubt that the compound in the claims of the divisional application would be covered in the Markush.

The question of therapeutic efficacy under Section 3(d) of the Act would arise only if the application in question was a completely independent application and did not originate from a parent application.

Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.—(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, and for that purpose,—  (a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. (2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; however, a party shall not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. (3) A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. (4) The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases referred to in sub-section (2) or subsection (3), admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified. (5) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) and, where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision rejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award.  (6) A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award may make an application for setting aside such an arbitral award in accordance with section 34  “45. It is seen that some High Courts have proceeded on the basis that any order passed by an arbitral tribunal during arbitration, would be capable of being challenged under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1712542/>)Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India. We see no warrant for such an approach. (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1656413/>)Section 37 makes certain orders of the arbitral tribunal appealable. Under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1722761/>)Section 34, the aggrieved party has an avenue for ventilating his grievances against the award including any in-between orders that might have been passed by the arbitral tribunal acting under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/109140/>)Section 16 of the Act. The party aggrieved by any order of the arbitral tribunal, unless has a right of appeal under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1656413/>)Section 37 of the Act, has to wait until the award is passed by the Tribunal. This appears to be the scheme of the Act. The arbitral tribunal is after all, the creature of a contract between the parties, the arbitration agreement, even though if the occasion arises, the Chief Justice may constitute it based on the contract between the parties. But that would not alter the status of the arbitral tribunal. It will still be a forum chosen by the parties by agreement. We, therefore, disapprove of the stand adopted by some of the High Courts that any order passed by the arbitral tribunal is capable of being corrected by the High Court under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1712542/>)Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India.

In that sense of the matter, SBP2 does not regard the party, aggrieved by the interlocutory order to be remediless, as the party has a remedy, albeit against the final award by the learned arbitrator.  3 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.—(1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with subsection (2) and sub-section (3).  4 37. Appealable orders.—(1) An appeal shall lie from the following orders (and from no others) to the Court authorised by law to hear appeals from original decrees of the Court passing the order, namely:— (a) refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under section 8; (b) granting or refusing to grant any measure under section 9; (c) setting aside or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under section 34. (2) Appeal shall also lie to a court from an order of the arbitral tribunal— (a) accepting the plea referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 16; or (b) granting or refusing to grant an interim measure under section 17. (3) No second appeal shall lie from an order passed in appeal under this section, but nothing in this section shall affect or take away any right to appeal to the Supreme Court.  Mr. Anukul Raj, learned Counsel for the petitioner, sought to distinguish SBP2 by referring to para 44 of the report, which read thus:  “44. Once we arrive at the conclusion that the proceeding before the Chief Justice while entertaining an application under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/596725/>)Section 11(6) of the Act is adjudicatory, then obviously, the outcome of that adjudication is a judicial order. Once it is a judicial order, the same, as far as the High Court is concerned would be final and the only avenue open to a party feeling aggrieved by the order of the Chief Justice would be to approach to the Supreme Court under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/427855/>)(<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/427855/>)Article (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/427855/>)136 of the Constitution of India. If it were an order by the Chief Justice of India, the party will not have any further remedy in respect of the matters covered by the order of the Chief Justice of India or the Judge of the Page 1822 Supreme Court designated by him and he will have to participate in the arbitration before the Tribunal only on the merits of the claim. Obviously, the dispensation in our country, does not contemplate any further appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court and there appears to be nothing objectionable in taking the view that the order of the Chief Justice of India would be final on the matters which are within his purview, while called upon to exercise his jurisdiction under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/596725/>)(<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/596725/>)Section (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/596725/>)11 of the Act.

Where the law is declared in an omnibus manner by the Supreme Court and is clearly intended to apply to all as an enunciation of the true legal position, it would be fallacious on the part of a judicial authority, lower in the judicial hierarchy, to seek to limit the sweep of the enunciation of the law on the basis of the facts which were before the Supreme Court.
