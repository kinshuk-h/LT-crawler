Monica Chawla, AIR 1994 Del 309, to submit that ‘publication’ would mean disclosure of the design to a member of the public, who is under no obligation to keep it secret. In the present case, as the goods were admittedly being imported from China, the design of the product was being disclosed to various individuals who handled the import of consignment of these products and, therefore, the design was prior published as on the date of its registration.",

He submits that in the present case, apart from asserting that the plaintiff is importing its goods from the Chinese manufacturer mentioned hereinabove, the defendant has not placed any document to show that the Chinese manufacturer is, in fact, the proprietor of the design or had published the same in any form prior to the date of the grant of registration of the design in favour of the plaintiff. In support, he places reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Bharat Glass Tube Limited. v.

This court is also of the opinion that the Full Bench ruling in Mohan Lal (supra) made an observation, which is inaccurate: it firstly correctly noted that registration as a design is not possible, of a trade mark; it, however later noted that “post registration under Section 11 of the Designs Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the registrant of the design.  The reason being: the use of a registered design as a trade mark, is not provided as a ground for its cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.” This observation ignores that the Designs Act, Section 19(e) specifically exposes a  registered design to cancellation when “(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.” The reason for this is that Section 2 of the Designs Act, defines “design” as “.... the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article......; but does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958...... ” Therefore, if the registered design per se is used as a trade mark, it apparently can be cancelled. The larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or “trade dress” however, is correct; as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the product through its packaging and so on, given that a “passing off” claim can include but is also broader than infringement of a trademark, the cause of action against such use lies.”  (Emphasis supplied in Bold)",

Of these, only five License Agreements pertain to Indian entities. He submits that the plaintiff/non-applicant has effectively filed only thirty-seven License Agreements with different entities, both Indian and Global, and, the remaining thirty-three agreements are either amendments or executed with the same entities on different dates; thirty-six of the License Agreements as produced by the plaintiff/non-applicant are not even valid and subsisting as on date and no renewed or latest License Agreements have been produced by the plaintiff/non-applicant to prove their validity; some of the License Agreements do not even pertain to the companies which are in the same business or trade as that of the defendant no.2.

Dinesh Kumar, the petitioner herein, was employed as a Caretaker with the Respondent No. 2. Respondent No. 1 is the University of Delhi whereas Respondent No. 2 is Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women (hereinafter referred to as “the College”).  b.  The College issued an advertisement in the Times of India on 26.3.1997 inviting applications for various  teaching and non-teaching posts. One of the posts notified at S. No. 7 was “Caretaker (1) (Rs. 950-1400), (SC)”, for which the qualifications prescribed were“matriculation with some experience of maintenance of Electrical, Sanitary, Water installations and Supervision of normal building repairs.” The petitioner by way of his application dated 2.4.1997, addressed to the Principal of the College, applied for the position of Caretaker.  c.  The College issued memorandum bearing number CASW/PF/DK/98/296(A) dated 21.7.1998 appointing the petitioner to the said position on daily wages for a period of three months.This was followed by another memorandum bearing number CASW/PF/DK/98/641(8) dated 5.10.1998 issued by the College whereby engagement of services of the petitioner was renewed on an ad-hoc basis for a period of six months. Thereafter, his appointment was continued from time to time by ad-hoc appointment letters until 2004.  d.  On 2.10.2002, the College again advertised a call for applications to certain non-teaching posts. One of the posts notified was for “Caretaker (l)”, against which the qualifications were notified as “Matriculation with some experience of maintenance, sanitary water installations and supervision of normal building repairs.” The  petitioner applied to the said position through his application dated 8.10.2002.  e.  On 26.4.2004, the petitioner sent a letter, by registered post to the Principal of the College, requesting for regularisation of his services as well as for giving him annual increments.  f.  On the same date, the College advertised a call for applications in the Time of India for recruitment to certain teaching and non-teaching positions. One of the positions notified in the non-teaching category at S. No. 3 was “Caretaker (1)”. The qualifications for the said position were the same as notified earlier. The petitioner applied to the said position through his application dated 28.4.2004, and his candidature was considered by the Selection Committee.  g.  In the meeting of the Governing Body of the College dated 5.8.2004, it was noted that for appointment to the post of Caretaker no one was recommended for regular appointment but in the case of petitioner, it was recommended to appoint him on purely ad-hoc basis, and he be asked to undergo training in electricity and sanitation within a period of one year. The recommendation was accordingly approved. The College issued an Office Order dated 10.8.2004, whereby the  petitioner was intimated about the said requirement to be fulfilled within the span of one year.  h.  The petitioner approached this Court by way of a Writ Petition bearing number WP (C) No. 153/2005 on 7.1.2005 praying for his regularisation. The said petition was disposed of by this Court vide the judgment dated 22.9.2006 wherein it was held that his services could not be regularised. The respondents therein were asked to take a decision, on the suitability of the petitioner to the post and whether to continue him in service, within a period of two months.  i.

During the pendency of the said appeal, the College on 17.10.2006 issued a letter to the petitioner, whereby the services of the petitioner as Caretaker were terminated.  j.  The petitioner, aggrieved by the same, has approached this Court by way of the instant petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India impugning the said termination order.",

State of Maharashtra &Ors. (1990) 2 SCC 715, wherein it was held as under:  “35...It is well established that the principles of res judicata are applicable to writ petitions. The relief prayed for on behalf of the petitioner in the present case is the same as he would have, in the event of his success, obtained in the earlier writ petition before the High Court. The petitioner in reply contended that since the special leave petition before this Court was dismissed in limine without giving any reason, the order cannot be relied upon for a plea of res judicata. The answer is that it is not the order of this Court dismissing the special leave petition which is being relied upon; the plea of res judicata has been pressed on the basis of the High Court’s judgment which became final after the dismissal of the special leave petition. In similar situation a Constitution Bench of this Court in Daryao v. State of UP, AIR 1961 SC 1457, held that where the High Court dismisses a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution after hearing the matter on the merits, a subsequent petition in the Supreme Court under Article 32 on the same facts and for the same reliefs filed by the same parties will be barred by the general principle of res judicata. The binding character of judgments of courts of competent jurisdiction is in essence a part of the rule of law on which the administration of justice, so much emphasised by the Constitution, is founded and a judgment of the High Court under Article 226 passed after a hearing on the merits must bind the parties till set aside in appeal as provided by the Constitution and cannot be permitted to be circumvented by a petition under Article 32...”",

State of Himachal Pradesh2021 SCC OnLine SC 334, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated and summarized the principles governing the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court in the presence of an alternate remedy. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed:  “28. The principles of law which emerge are that:  (i)  The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well;  (ii)  The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person;  (iii)  Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice;  (c)  the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or  (d)  the vires of a legislation is challenged;  (iv)  An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in an appropriate case though ordinarily, a writ petition should not be entertained when an efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law;  (v)  When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion; and  (vi)  In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be interfered with.”",

The revocation petitions have been opposed by the Patentee. In the applications filed by the Patentee, the ground taken is that since the patent was granted on 5th October, 2010, the filing of revocations petitions more than 12 years thereafter would be barred by limitation. It is also urged that the said patent was published on two occasions. Once under Section 11A of the Patents Act, 1970 (hereinafter •Act•) on 23rd January, 2009 and the second time under Section 43(2) of the Act on 8th October, 2010. According to the Patentee, these publications provided constructive notice to the Petitioners to file objections to the grant of the patent.",

A perusal of the applications shows that the ground taken, is that the revocation petitions ought to have been filed within three years from the grant of the patent in view of Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963. In the opinion of the Court, the issue of limitation in filing revocation petitions is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Dr. Reddys  Laboratories Ltd. (supra) case wherein the Court has held as under:  • 13. Since the interest in seeking revocation could arise at any time, it is notable that there is no specific limitation period prescribed for seeking revocation under Section 64. By contrast, under Section 25(2), a specific period of limitation has been prescribed for oppositions. Section 25(2) of the Patents Act reads as under:  •(2) At any time after the grant of patent but before the expiry of a period of one year from the date of publication of grant of a patent, any person interested may give notice of opposition to the Controller in the prescribed  manner on any of the following grounds, namely:-••",

To read Article 137 of the Limitation Act, into Section 64 of the Patents Act, would be in effect rewriting the said provision, which would not be permissible by judicial interpretation. Moreover, the fact that a •person interested• can file a counter claim under Section 64 seeking revocation shows that the trigger for the filing of the counter claim may not arise until and unless the suit itself is filed. This itself shows that the limitation of three years cannot be read into the period for filing the revocation petition.  XXX",

                        "content": "These two writ petitions challenge proceedings initiated by the Directorate of Enforcement, the respondents herein, under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 20021 . The leading writ petition had come to be  preferred at a time when a provisional order of attachment came to be made under the Act. The Court, by its order of 06 January 2022, entertained the writ petition and called upon the respondents to file their replies. On 03 March 2022, this Court took notice of the proceedings initiated by the Adjudicating Authority before whom the matter came to be placed for the purposes of confirmation of the provisional order of attachment. Taking note of the rival submissions, this Court on that date allowed the amendments proposed and passed the following detailed order: - 1 The Act  ―CM APPL. 10948/2022 (for amendment of petition) in W.P.(C) 14999/2021 CM APPL. 10951/2022 (for amendment of petition)  in W.P.(C) 15000/2021  The record reflects that the present petition was instituted at a stage when a Provisional Order of Attachment had come to be made in terms of the provisions of Section 5 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 [PMLA]. The submissions of respective parties were noticed in some detail in the order of 06 January 2022. Pursuant to that order, parties were directed to exchange pleadings. Counter and rejoinder affidavits have subsequently come to be filed. By way of the present application for amendment, the petitioners lay challenge to the notices issued under Section 8 of the PMLA by the Adjudicating Authority.  Learned counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate has, at the outset, submitted that in the fitness of things, the petitioners should be called upon to file their replies to the show-cause notices leaving it open to the Adjudicating Authority to decide all contentions which are urged before this Court.   While ordinarily that may have sufficed, this Court notes that, by the order of 06 January 2022, the challenge to the initiation of proceedings under the PMLA on jurisdictional grounds was duly entertained. The Court had taken notice of the challenge mounted on the ground that the offenses which are alleged to have been committed, were not enumerated as a ―scheduled offense‖ at the relevant point of time. In that view of the matter and since the Court has already taken note of the challenge raised, it would be inappropriate to grant liberty to the Adjudicating Authority to independently rule on the questions which are raised here.   The amendments essentially assail further proceedings and steps taken pursuant to the Provisional Order of Attachment. In view of the aforesaid, the  amendments as proposed by way of the present application are allowed.  The Court notes that the amended writ petition already exists on the record.  The application shall stand disposed of.  W.P.(C) 14999/2021 & CM APPLs. 47329/2021, 553/2022, 10949/2022 W.P.(C) 15000/2021 & CM APPLs. 47331/2021, 547/2022, 10952/2022  Learned counsel representing the Enforcement Directorate prays for and is granted time to file reply to the added pleadings taken.   For the purpose of considering the prayer for interim relief, the Court takes note of the contentions recorded in the earlier order of 06 January 2022 as well as the submission of Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners, who submits that the offences of which the petitioners are charged did not even form part of scheduled offences as contemplated under the PMLA. Additionally, the Court notes that the recordal of satisfaction by the Adjudicating Authority, prima facie, does not appear to satisfy the requirements of Section 8 of the PMLA.  The matter requires consideration.  Till the next date of listing, there shall be stay of further proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority.  Let this matter be posted again on 31.03.2022.‖",

It may, at the outset, be noted that the prayer for deferral of proceedings on the present writ petitions was raised for the first time in terms of the counter affidavit which came to be filed by respondents on 16 April 2022. When the amendment application came to be allowed by the Court in terms of its order of 03 March 2022, parties had agreed for the matter being placed for final disposal after exchange of pleadings. It was on the aforesaid understanding that the writ petitions were placed for final arguments on 25 April 2022 at 3.30 pm. However and notwithstanding the above, in order to evaluate the correctness of submission raised by Mr. Raju it would be appropriate to briefly note the principal arguments which were addressed by Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the writ petitioners, and compare the same with the issues which are raised before the Supreme Court in the pending batch.  7 1986 Supp. SCC 20  8 W.P.

                        "content": "Mr. Sibal has principally addressed the following submissions. It was contended that undisputedly the second chargesheet relates to events extending only upto the date of allocation of the coal block and thus restricted upto 04 September 2003. This according to Mr. Sibal is manifest from a reading of paragraphs 16.57 and 16.59 of the second chargesheet. Mr. Sibal has urged that  the allocation of the coal block cannot fall within the ambit of the expression ―proceeds of crime‖ as defined in Section 2(1)(u) of the Act. Learned Senior Counsel further contended that the allocation cannot possibly be considered or understood as representing property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a schedule offence. In view of the aforesaid, it was the submission of Mr. Sibal that the proceedings initiated under the Act are wholly without jurisdiction. It was further contended that activities undertaken by the petitioners post 04 September 2003 including the extraction of coal and its alleged diversion were activities and events which formed subject matter of the first chargesheet. It was in the aforesaid backdrop that Mr. Sibal argued that once that chargesheet had come to be quashed, no proceedings could have been validly initiated under the Act. In any case and without prejudice to the above, Mr. Sibal submitted that since undisputedly the impugned proceedings emanate from the second chargesheet and stand restricted to events upto 04 September 2003 only, and since the allocation of coal cannot constitute proceeds of crime, the writ petitions are liable to be allowed on this short ground alone. It was further urged by Mr. Sibal that admittedly the coal block had came to be allocated on 04 September 2003. It was pointed out that the Act itself came to be enforced subsequently on 01 July 2005. The provisions of Section 120B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code10 came to be included as scheduled offences only on 01 June 2009. In view of the aforesaid facts, Mr. Sibal, learned Senior Counsel, as well as Mr. Chawla, learned counsel, appearing in the connected writ petition contended that any penal action or attachment under the Act for acts of alleged money  10 Penal Code  laundering which occurred prior to 01 July 2005 would be wholly illegal and violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution. Mr. Chawla, learned counsel, also urged that since the provisions of Section 120B and 420 of the Penal Code came to be included in the Schedule only on 01 June 2009, those properties which were acquired prior to that date cannot be subjected to attachment or confiscation under the Act. It was additionally argued that, in any case, since the alleged criminal activities which occurred post 04 September 2003 cannot form the basis for any action under the Act consequent to the first chargesheet having been quashed, properties which had been purchased post 04 September 2003 also cannot be attached or confiscated. Mr. Chawla additionally also addressed submissions in the backdrop of the decision rendered by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Seema Garg Vs. Deputy Director11 .",

Whether an allocation of coal can be viewed as ―proceeds of crime‖ is not a question which can be said to be even remotely engaging the attention of the Supreme Court. Similarly, the question whether the allocation could be treated as property derived or obtained from criminal activity also does not appear to be an issue raised for the consideration of the Supreme Court. The impact, if any, of the second chargesheet being restricted upto 04 September 2003 on the proceedings impugned in these two writ petitions is again an issue which would have to be adjudged on the facts obtaining in these two writ petitions. A decision on that issue cannot possibly be contended to be connected  in any manner with the submissions addressed either by Mr. Raju or the learned Solicitor General of India before the Supreme Court. The arguments addressed by Mr. Sibal as well as Mr. Chawla essentially turn and rest on the facts leading to the filing of the present petitions, the past history of litigation inter partes and the jurisdiction of the Adjudicating Authority to proceed under the Act.

Mr. Raju urged that courts have consistently taken the view that a challenge at the stage of a show-cause notice should not be entertained by High Courts while exercising their  powers under Article 226 of the Constitution. It was further contended that the Act creates a comprehensive statutory mechanism for adjudication of all questions that are raised here before the Adjudicating Authority. Those provisions according to Mr. Raju lay in place an efficacious statutory alternative remedy and thus the writ petitioners should be relegated to follow the procedure as prescribed under the Act. Mr. Raju in support of his submissions has drawn the attention of the Court to the following decisions and submits that the writ petitions are liable to be dismissed and the petitioners directed to raise all available challenges before the Adjudicating Authority. To buttress the aforesaid submission, learned ASG placed reliance on the following decisions, which are as follows:- In Special Director v. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse12 on the question of maintainability of a writ petition against a show cause notice, the Supreme Court held as follows:  ―5.This Court in a large number of cases has deprecated the practice of the High Courts entertaining writ petitions questioning legality of the show-cause notices stalling enquiries as proposed and retarding investigative process to find actual facts with the participation and in the presence of the parties. Unless the High Court is satisfied that the show-cause notice was totally non est in the eye of the law for absolute want of jurisdiction of the authority to even investigate into facts, writ petitions should not be entertained for the mere asking and as a matter of routine, and the writ petitioner should invariably be directed to respond to the show-cause notice and take all stands highlighted in the writ petition. Whether the show-cause notice was founded on any legal premises, is a jurisdictional issue which can even be urged by the recipient of the notice and such issues also can be adjudicated by the authority issuing the very notice initially, before the aggrieved could approach the court. Further, when the court passes an interim order it should be careful to see that the statutory functionaries specially and  specifically constituted for the purpose are not denuded of powers and authority to initially decide the matter and ensure that ultimate relief which may or may not be finally granted in the writ petition is not accorded to the writ petitioner even at the threshold by the interim protection granted.  12(2004) 3 SCC 440",

The respondent had entered appearance and we have heard the learned Senior Counsel on either side. In the fitness of things, taking into account the above circumstances, we dispose of the appeal with a direction that the proceedings emanating from the show-cause notice shall be continued, but the final order passed pursuant thereto shall not be communicated to Respondent 1 (writ petitioner) without leave or further orders of the High Court. The writ petition shall be disposed of on merits in accordance with law. Any observation made in this appeal shall not be construed to be expression of any opinion on the merits of the matter pending before the High Court. Since the controversy is of a very limited as well as serious nature, the High Court may explore the possibility of early disposal of the writ petition. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated with no order as to costs.‖  Learned ASG then referred to the decision of Farida Begum Biswas vs. Union of India13where a similar view was taken, and more particularly to the following passages of that decision:- ―14. In the instant case, the petitioners have received show cause notice dated 19.06.2015 under Section 8 of the PMLA in O.C. No. 501/2015 and the provisional attachment order dated 21.05.2015 under Section 5 of the PMLA issued by the respondent No. 2. The action of coming to this Court is premature and therefore, this Court is of the view that since the petitioners have effective and efficacious remedy under PMLA, necessitating institution of the petition by invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court is not appropriate at this stage.  132015 SCC OnLine Del 11834  If this Court were to enter into the merits of this case at this stage, it would amount to scuttling the statutorily engrafted mechanism i.e. PMLA.‖  ―6. In the opinion of this Court, mixed questions of fact and law are involved in the present case. Moreover, as a show cause notice has already been issued as to why the provisional attachment order be not confirmed, this Court is of the view that the ends of justice would be met if the petitioners are permitted to take all their pleas and defences in the adjudication proceedings, which are pending under Section 8 of the PML Act.‖",

However, those very decisions have also carved out the exceptions in which such a challenge would be sustainable. The Court takes note of the following principles as were enunciated in the celebrated and oft cited decision of the Supreme Court in Whirlpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trademarks15 :- ―14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution.

But the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.

                        "content": "Before proceeding to deal with the merits of the matter, the following salient facts may be noticed. PIL is stated to have applied for the grant of a mining lease on 25 May 1992. Its application is stated to have been taken up for consideration by the Screening Committee while dealing with other proposals relating to captive mining by power generating companies in its meeting held on 14 July 1993. According to the petitioners, PIL installed a Sponge Iron Plant at Chotia in the State of Chhattisgarh with a production capacity of 1.5 LTPA on 01 November 1993. On 30 September 1996, the Ministry of Coal is stated to have apprised PIL of its decision to permit it to explore the Hasdeo-Arand coal block for captive development. Pursuant to the aforesaid communication, PIL is stated to have apprised the Ministry of Coal of it having undertaken preparatory steps for exploration of the Chotia block falling within the Hasdeo-Arand and Panchvahini coalfields. The application for allocation of the Chotia coal block remained pending for consideration till it was allocated to PIL on 04 September 2003. On 07 April 2010, the first FIR came to be registered. That FIR alluded to acts of PIL which were alleged to amount to a misrepresentation with respect to its captive activity, submission of false and incorrect information in order to obtain allotment of the coal block and diversion of coal extracted from that block in the open market. In terms of that first FIR and chargesheet, PIL was alleged to have  diverted 2,27,000 tons of coal in the open market and thus earned illegal profits amounting to Rs. 22.7 crores. The allegations forming subject matter of the first chargesheet were succinctly noticed by the Court in its judgment of 05 September 2014 as follows:- ―3. During the course of hearing, the facts adverted to by learned Senior Counsel for petitioners as culled out from the charge-sheet are as under:  I.  M/s. Prakash Industries Ltd. (PIL) referred to as AccusedNo.4 installed a sponge iron plant in the year 1993 with an annual production capacity of 1,50,000 MT per annum with one functioning kiln. (Para-17.3 of the Charge-Sheet at page-l46 of Vol.I refers)  II.  In the year 1996, accused No.4-PIL added another kiln increasing the annual production capacity to 2,50,000 MT per annum. Therefore, in the year 1996, the production capacity of Accused No.4-PIL was 4,00,000MTper annum.  III.  The third kiln having an annual production capacity 0f 2,00,000 MT per annum was installed in the year 2009. So, the total capacity of accused No.4-PIL in the year 2009 was 6,00,000 MT per annum.  IV.  For the purpose of expansion of sponge iron capacity from 4,00,000 MT per annum to 8,00,000 MT per annum, the Ministry of Coal in the year 2003 allotted Chotia Coal Block to accused No.4-PIL for developing third and fourth kiln. Infact, the kiln No.3 was set up in March 2009 and Kiln No.4 was set by April 2010.  V.  While the capacity of accused No.4-PIL was being enhanced, PIL was getting linkage coal which was stopped in January 2007 on its request.  VI.  In the year 2006, Ministry of Coal, advertised for allocation of 38 coal blocks for captive use. PIL applied for allocation of Utkan Coal Block and Vijay Central Coal Block (Para-17.4 of the Charge Sheet at Page-147 refers). The application is of January 12, 2007. (at Page 210 in Vol. II).  VII.  The document dated 08.10.2009 of the office of the Coal Controller specifically states that Chotia Coal Block was allotted to PIL on September 4,2003 to meet the additional coal requirement for expansion of annual capacity of sponge iron project at Champa from the existing 4,00,000 MT P.A. to 8,00,000 MT P.A. i.e. additional 4,00,000 MT P.A. capacity. (Para-I at page -367 of Vol.II) [document D-46 (Annexure P-20) refers].  VIII. The afore-referred application reflects that PIL at that point of time i.e. in the year 2006 had an annual production capacity of 4, 00, 000 MT P.A. but had been allocated coal for the increased capacity upto 8,00,000 MT P.A. (at pages-215 and 216 of Vol.II)  IX The aforesaid Application which seeks allocations of Vijay Central beyond the capacity of 8,00,000 MT P.A. clearly states that the capacity in the year 2006 was only 4,00,000 MT P.A. whereas the application also stipulates that its capacity had already been increased to 8, 00, 000 MT P.A. for which coal allocation had already been done from Chotia Coal Block.  X. The above-said Application was forwarded to the Ministry of Steel for examination and recommendation. (Para-17.4 at page-147 of Charge-Sheet refers).  XI. Ministry of Steel vide OM dated December 6, 2007recommended allocation in favour of PIL for Vijay Central Coal Block showing its existing capacity as of 8, 00, 000 MTPA for the proposed additional 12,00,000MTPAfor an over all capacity of 20,00,000 MTPA (Para-17.5 at page-147 of Charge-Sheet refers).  XII. The Screening Committee in meetings of 7th & 8th December, 2008 requested applicants to make individual presentations and on July 3, 2008 met to finalize all recommendations pending with them. The recommendation for allocation of additional 12,00,000 MT P.A. by Ministry of Steel in favour of PIL from Vijay Central Coal Block was cleared. (Para-17.6 atpage-147 of Charge-sheet refers).  XIII. However, before the final orders of allocation were made, M/s. SKS Ispat Power Ltd (SKS) on July 7, 2008 questioned the capacity of PIL as disclosed and accused PIL of inflated capacity and production figures to Secretary Coal. This representation was forwarded· in July 8, 2008 to Ministry of Steel. [Para-17.8 of Charge-sheet on page-148 and D-7(Annexure P-9) at page 250 refers].  XIV. On July 9, 2008 Ministry of Steel sought fresh production figures from PIL for the last 6 months in respect of its sponge iron plant at Champa. (Para-17. 9 at page 148 of Charge-Sheet at page 254 refers).  XV. That PIL responded by letter dated 10.07.2008 under the alleged signatures of Accused No.3-A. K. Chaturvedi, petitioner No. I herein giving excess production figures of sponge iron. Alongwith this letter ER Forms, Surveyors Report and CA‘s certificates were purportedly enclosed. The Ministry of Steel after examining the representation of SKS forwarded it to the Ministry of Coal. (Para-17.9 on page 148 of Charge-Sheet refers).  XVI. The Forensic Report (at page 340) revealed this document of 1O' July, 2008 does not bear the signatures of A.K. Chaturvedi. However, the Forensic Report states that documents dated 10.07.2008 and 23.07.2008 are on the Letter Head of PIL and the source of origin of the Paper in the two letters is the same. (Para-17.12 on page 150 of Charge-Sheet refers).  XVII.Another representation dated 16.07.2008 was received by Ministry of Steel from SKS and the Steel Ministry sought comments from the Ministry of Coal.  XVIII. On 23.07.2008 PIL responded under the signatures of A.K. Chaturvedi and forwarded copies of ER Forms which showed the production figures at page 153 in Vol.I as reflected in Column II of the table set out therein. (Para-17.11 on page 150 of charge-sheet refers).  XIX. That pursuant to the complaints of SKS and the documents of July 10 and July 23, 2008 the Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Steel held a meeting on July 25,2008, the Minutes of which dated September 1, 2008 were forwarded to the Ministry of Steel by way of furnishing clarifications. Ministry of Coal decided to undertake a spot verification of the production capacity of PIL and directed G.K. Basak Executive Secretary JPC on September 2, 2008 to visit the Factory Premises of PIL and assess its production capacity and forward a report to the Ministry of Steel. (Para-17.13 on page 150 of charge-sheet refers).  XX. A spot Inspection at PIL site was conducted by accused-Mr. G.K. Basak and Mr. Soumen Chatterjee on September 4, 2008. They submitted a verification report on September 5, 2008 and forwarded it to the Ministry of Steel. The Inspection Report indicated that the PIL had four kilns and annual installed capacity of sponge iron at 7.2 lacs MT P.A. The visits and the report of G.K. Basak and Soumen Chatterjee Accused No.1 & 2 are not disputed. (Para-17.14 on page 150 of Charge-Sheet refers).  XXI. The minutes of the joint meeting dated July 25, 2008 (at page 348 in Vol.II), reflect that in the year 2008, both the Ministry of Steel and Ministry of Coal were aware that the then current capacity for production of sponge iron was 6, 00, 000 MT P.A. and that the allege false representation of capacity by PIL is not substantiated. (at Para 6 page 349 in Vol. II refers).  XXII. On further complaints, clarification was sought from AccusedNo.1 &2 on the contents of their spot verification report and they substantially reiterated their position on production capacity of PIL.  XXIII. The crux of the prosecution is that the quantities of sponge iron manufactured by PIL as reflected in the attested copies of ER-1 Forms and in the  report of Basak and Soumen Chatterjee on September 5, 2008 are inconsistent with the data forwarded by PIL along with ER-1 Forms in their letter dated July 23, 2008. In fact, according to the charge-sheet, there are no ER-1 forms in original as copies thereof were submitted to the Ministry of Steel along with the alleged communication of 10th July, 2008. The original ER-I Forms are in fact submitted to the Ministry of Steel by PIL on 23rd July, 2008. This fact is admitted by the prosecution Pg 150 of paper book refers).”  The prosecution case on conspiracy angle qua petitioners is based on the following two elements: - •  That the report of accused-G.K. Basak and Soumen Chatterjee submitted on September 5, 2008 reflecting production figures of PIL substantially tallied with the data of production figures provided in the alleged letter of 10 July, 2008 to the Ministry of Steel.  •  That on 4th and 5th September, 2008, at the time of inspection by Accused No. I & 2, petitioners A.K. Chaturvedi (Accused No.3) was also present.‖‖",

Thereupon, a prima facie conclusion arrived at is that the material on record which forms the part of the charge-sheet is not sufficient to support the conclusion arrived at by trial court. To say the least, trial court was not justified to put petitioners on trial, merely because there is confusion about the production capacity of the operating kilns. Trial court in the impugned order has noted that the incriminating letter of 10\" July, 2008 does not bear the signatures of petitioner-A.K.

On behalf of respondent-CBI, it was much emphasized that petitioners' communication of 29 January, 2007 (Annexure P-5) disclosing the correct factual position is not part of the charge-sheet. This is true, but it appears from bare perusal of petitioners' communication of 29 January, 2007 (Annexure P-5) that it is a reiteration of petitioners' earlier communication of 12th January, 2007 (Annexure P-4) which infact is part of the charge-sheet and therein it is clearly disclosed that the existing capacity of the plant in question is 4 LTPA. No doubt, the sanctioned capacity of theexisting plant in question was 8 lac metric tonnes per annum. Thus, there is no confusion about the existing capacity of the plant in question.",

However, and as noticed in the introductory part of this judgment, the impugned proceedings rest upon the allegations which form part of the second chargesheet. That chargesheet takes due notice of the fact that the original FIR as well as the first chargesheet already stands quashed. It is perhaps in that background that the said chargesheet restricts itself to activities and events which transpired up to the allocation of the coal block itself on 04 September 2003. This is evident from the following recitals as appearing in the second chargesheet: - ―16.57 A case RC AC2 2010 A0001 was registered by CB I, AC-I, -New Delhi on 07 .04.201 0 against Mis Prakash Industries Limited and others.

Mr. Sibal contended that the allocation of coal cannot be construed as being proceeds of crime since it clearly does not represent property which may be said to be derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It was submitted that the allocation of coal in itself cannot possibly be understood as being proceeds of crime since it only conferred upon the petitioner the right to apply for the grant of a mining lease. It was submitted that the entire allegation levelled against PIL is of having obtained that allocation by way of misrepresentation and fraudulent conduct. According to Mr. Sibal it was only monies and profits that may have been generated by the utilisation of that allocation which could have possibly fallen within the scope of the expression ―proceeds of crime‖ as defined in Section 2(1)(u) of the Act. Mr. Sibal then submitted that the allocation of coal would also not fall within the ambit of Section 3 since that also proceeds on the basis of a party being involved in any process or activity connected with proceeds of crime and which process or activity may include the concealment, possession, acquisition or use of property along with conduct which may amount to projecting or claiming it to be untainted property. Mr. Sibal submitted that the allocation of coal was made by the Union Government and it cannot possibly be alleged that it was property which was concealed, possessed, acquired or used nor can it be alleged that the same was projected or claimed as untainted property. It was submitted that the allocation of coal was made by a public act of a competent authority in the Union Government and existed as such till it was ultimately quashed and set aside in Manohar Lal Sharma. In view of the above, it was contended that the coal allocation cannot possibly be construed as falling within  the contours of Section 3 and thus evidencing the commission of an offence of money laundering.",

Mr. Sibal further laid emphasis on the fact that any proceeds that may have been generated by utilization of the allocation formed subject matter of the first chargesheet. Mr. Sibal underlined the fact that the second chargesheet stood restricted up to events which had occurred till 04 September 2003 that is the date when the coal block came to be allocated.

Mr. Sibal also drew the Court‘s attention to the fact that Sections 120B and 420 of the Penal Code came to be included as scheduled offences only on 1 June 2009. According to Mr. Sibal,  bearing in mind the fact that the allocation of coal was made on 04 September 2003, the invocation of the provisions of the Act would clearly amount to violation of Article 20(1) of the Constitution. According to Mr. Sibal, the impugned proceedings essentially seek to penalize the petitioners for the commission of an offence which was not even in existence on 04 September 2003. It was also pointed out that the impugned proceedings lay no allegation of any offence of money laundering having been committed by the petitioners after the Act had come into force. For the purposes of explaining the extent of the guarantee enshrined in Article 20(1) of the Constitution, Mr. Sibal placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Mahipal Singh vs. CBI16 and more particularly to the following paragraphs which are extracted hereunder: - ―14. We have given our most anxious consideration to the rival submissions and in the light of what we have observed above, the submissions advanced by Mr Subramanium commend us. It is trite that to bring an accused within the mischief of the penal provision, ingredients of the offence have to be satisfied on the date the offence was committed. Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India permits conviction of a person for an offence for violation of law in force at the time of commission of the act charged as an offence. In the case in hand, examinations alleged to have been rigged had taken place in January 2010, June 2010, November 2010 and January 2011 and the date on which the first information reports were registered, more than one charge-sheets were not filed against the accused for the offence of specified nature within the preceding period of ten years and further, the court had not taken cognizance in such number of cases. As observed earlier, for punishment for the offence of organised crime under Section 3 of MCOCA, the accused is required to be involved in continuing unlawful activity which inter alia provides that more than one charge-sheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and the court had taken cognizance of such offence. Therefore, in the case in hand, on the date of commission of the offence, all the ingredients to bring the act within Section 3 of MCOCA have not been satisfied. We are conscious of the fact that there may be a case in which on the date of registration of the case, one may not be aware of the fact of charge-sheet and  cognizance being taken in more than one case in respect of the offence of specified nature within the preceding period of ten years, but during the course of investigation, if it transpires that such charge-sheets and cognizance have been taken, Section 3 of MCOCA can be invoked. There may be a case in which the investigating agency does not know exactly the date on which the crime was committed; in our opinion, in such a case the date on which the offence comes to the notice of the investigating agency, the ingredients constituting the offence have to be satisfied. In our opinion, an act which is not an offence on the date of its commission or the date on which it came to be known, cannot be treated as an offence because of certain events taking place later on. We may hasten to add here that there may not be any impediment in complying with the procedural requirement later on in case the ingredients of the offence are satisfied, but satisfying the requirement later on to bring the act within the mischief of penal provision is not permissible. In other words, procedural requirement for prosecution of a person for an offence can later on be satisfied but ingredients constituting the offence must exist on the date the crime is committed or detected. Submission of charge-sheets in more than one case and taking cognizance in such number of cases are ingredients of the offence and have to be satisfied on the date the crime was committed or came to be known.  16 (2014) 11 SCC 282",

                        "content": "Now we proceed to apply the principle aforesaid to the facts of the present case. We find that on the date the offence was committed or came to be known, one of the ingredients of the offence i.e. submission of charge-sheet and cognizance of offence of specified nature in more than one case within the preceding period of ten years, has not been satisfied. Therefore, we have no other option than to hold that the accused cannot be prosecuted for the offence under Section 3 of MCOCA.‖  Reliance was also placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Kaliar Koil Subramaniam17 and to the following principles which were laid down therein: - ―6. It appears that the Legislature thereafter thought it proper to do away with the rule of evidence provided by sub-section (3) of Section 5 and inserted the new clause (e) in sub-section (1) of Section 5 as one more category of the offence of criminal misconduct. But it cannot be gainsaid that the new offence, under the newly inserted clause (e), became an offence on and from December 18, 1964 by virtue of Section 6 of the Amending Act 40 of 1964. In this view of the matter, the High Court rightly held that ―in the absence of any evidence on record to show that  the appellant acquired or was found to be in possession of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income after the coming into force of the Amending Act‖, he was entitled to the protection of clause (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution which provides as follows:  17 (1977) 3 SCC 525  ―20. (1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.‖  So when there was no law in force at the time when the accused was found in possession of disproportionate, assets by the search which was made on May 17, 1964, under which his possession could be said to constitute an offence, he was entitled to the protection of clause (1) of Article 20 and it was not permissible for the trial court to convict him of an offence under clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 as no such clause was in existence at the relevant time. The accused could not therefore be said to have committed an offence under clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 5 read with sub-section (2) of that section.‖",

Referring to the order passed by the Adjudicating Authority while issuing notice to the petitioners, it was pointed out that the Adjudicating Authority has failed to record any independent reasons which may have led to the formation of a reasonable belief that the properties which were subjected to provisional attachment were in fact proceeds of crime. It was further urged that the Adjudicating Authority has only expressed his agreement with the prima facie opinion which had been formed by the Deputy Director and which had led to the order of provisional attachment having coming to be passed.

Additionally, Mr. Chawla placed reliance on the decision rendered by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana  High Court in Seema Garg vs. Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement19 to submit that the orders passed by the respondents fail to allude to any material or evidence which may have linked the attached properties, directly or indirectly, to proceeds of crime. Mr. Chalwa in support of his submissions has placed reliance upon the following observations as entered by the Division Bench of that High  18 (1985) 1 SCC 591  ―13. Having scrutinized record of the case and heard arguments of both sides, we find that it would be appropriate to look into the scheme of the PMLA before adjudication of issues involved. The Phrase ‗proceeds of crime‘ has been defined under Section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA and the same is reproduced as under:  Section 2(1)(u) ―proceeds of crime‖ means any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or the value of any such property or where such property is taken or held outside the country, then the property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad. Explanation-For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that ―proceeds of crime‖ include property not only derived or obtained from the scheduled offence but also any property which may directly or indirectly be derived or obtained as a result of any criminal activity relatable to the scheduled offence.  There are three limbs of Section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA namely:  i)  Any property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to scheduled offence;  ii)  Value of property derived or obtained from criminal activity;  iii)  Property equivalent in value held in India or outside where property obtained or derived from criminal activity is taken or held outside the country.",

Punishment for money-laundering.-Whoever commits the offence of money-laundering shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine:  Provided that where the proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering relates to any offence specified under paragraph 2 of Part A of the Schedule, the provisions of this section shall have effect as if for the words ―which may extend to seven years‖, the words ―which may extend to ten years‖ had been substituted.  xxxx xxxx xxxx",

House is value of property derived from scheduled offence. Cash in the hands of an accused of offence under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is property directly derived from scheduled offence, however if some movable or immovable property is purchased against said cash, the movable or immovable property would be ‗value of property‘ derived from commission of scheduled offence.

Mr. Raju submitted that the Act essentially targets the offence of money laundering. The learned ASG submitted that merely because the predicate offence may have been committed prior to the enforcement of the Act, that would not invalidate the proceedings initiated by the respondents. Mr. Raju drawing the attention of the Court to the written submissions submitted by the learned ASG in proceedings before the Supreme Court has contended that it is well settled that merely because a part of the requisite for action initiated under a statute is drawn from a point prior to the enforcement of the Act that does not make the Act retrospective. Learned ASG has referred to the decision of the U.S.  ―Three grounds are urged for reversal. First, the 1917 law under which liquor lawfully acquired can be seized and destroyed is an ex post facto law. Second, the law in punishing the owner for possessing liquor he had lawfully acquired before its enactment deprives him of his property without due process. Third, it violates the due process requirement by the seizure and destruction of the liquor without giving the possessor his day in court. First, the law is not ex post facto law. It does not provide a punishment for a past offense. It does not fix a penalty for the owner for having become possessed of the liquor. The penalty it imposes is for continuing to possess the liquor after the enactment of the law. It is quite the same question as that presented in Chicago & Alton R.R. Co v Tranbarger, 238 U.S. 67. There a Missouri statute required railroads to construct water -outlets across their rights of way. The railroad company had constructed a solid embankment twelve years before the passage of the Act.

On the basis of the submissions noticed and the principles enunciated in Mohan Lal, it was urged that the date of coming into force of the Act as well as the date of the predicate offences having been committed was irrelevant. Mr. Raju submitted that if a scheduled offence is committed even before the enactment of the Act or a particular offence as specified in the Penal Code comes to be added in the Schedule subsequently, that in itself cannot mean that the invocation of the penal provisions of the Act would amount to its retrospective application. It was submitted that the Act penalizes a  separate and distinct offence of money laundering and it is therefore this offence alone which would determine the validity of proceedings. It was additionally submitted that the principles laid down in Seema Garg are clearly contrary to the judgment rendered by this Court in Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement vs. Axis Bank22 and therefore it is the principles laid down in the latter which would bind and apply. According to the learned ASG, Axis Bank has clearly held that the Act empowers the respondents not only to proceed against properties which may be directly linked to proceeds of crime but also against properties which would be equivalent in value thereof. It was submitted that in the present case the properties which have been provisionally attached are equivalent in value to the quantification of proceeds of crime and therefore the action as initiated by the respondents cannot be faulted. According to Mr. Raju even though the associate or sister companies may not have been directly charged with the commission of the predicate office, they can still be proceeded against if it is found that they are in possession of properties which were acquired or are the fruits of proceeds of crime.",

This issue assumes significance in the facts of the present case especially since the proceedings relating to the first chargesheet stand quashed. As this Court construes the provisions of the Act it is manifest that an offence of money laundering is founded on the commission of a predicate offence. The issue which arises is what would be the consequential impact, if any, of a predicate offence and proceedings in relation thereto coming to be quashed or even compounded and the accused discharged. In the considered opinion of this Court once it is found by the competent authority that a predicate offence is either not evidenced or on facts it is held that no offence at all was committed, proceedings under the  Act would necessarily have to fall or be brought to a close. The Court bears in mind the language of Section 3 of the Act which links the activities and processes of money laundering to proceeds of crime. Section 2(1)(u) creates an indelible link between property derived or obtained and criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is only when it is found that a person has derived property as a result of criminal activity that the offence of money laundering can be said to have been committed. Absent the element of criminal activity, the provisions of the Act itself would not be attracted. The offence of money laundering is essentially aimed at depriving persons of the fruits and benefits that may have been derived or obtained from criminal activity. However, once it is found that a criminal offence does not stand evidenced, the question of any property being derived or obtained therefrom or its confiscation or attachment would not arise at all and in any case, proceedings if initiated under the Act would be wholly without jurisdiction or authority. The Court notes that the issue of whether proceedings under the Act would survive even after the acquittal of a person in proceedings relating to the predicate offence was duly answered by a learned Judge of the Court in Rajiv Chanana vs. Dy. Director, Directorate of Enforcement 23 .  The relevant paragraphs are extracted hereinbelow: - ―18. The suggestion of the learned ASG that an attachment order under Section 5 of the PMLA would survive an acquittal of the concerned person for the alleged crime, is unsustainable. It was argued by the learned ASG that acquittal of the person after trial of a scheduled office would not release the order of attachment under PMLA till the trial for an offence under Section 3 of the PMLA is completed. This contention is based on an erroneous assumption that a trial for an offence of ―money laundering‖ under the PMLA would survive. One is hard pressed to  imagine how a trial for an offence of money laundering can continue where the fundamental basis -the commission of a schedule offence -in this case offence under Section 307 IPC -has been found to be disproved.  23 2014 SCC OnLine Del 4889",

                        "content": "In view of the above, the contention that the Act is completely independent of the principal crime (scheduled offence) giving rise to proceeds of crime is unmerited. It is necessary to bear in mind that the substratal subject of the Act is to prevent money-laundering and confiscate the proceeds of crime. In that perspective, there is an inextricable link between the Act and the occurrence of a crime. It cannot be disputed that the offence of money-laundering is a separate offence under section 3 of the Act, which is punishable under Section 4 of the Act. However as stated earlier, the offence of money-laundering relates to the proceeds of crime, the genesis of which is a scheduled offence. In the aforesaid circumstances, before initiation of any proceeding under Section 5 of the Act, it would be necessary for the concerned authorities to identify the scheduled crime. The First Proviso to Section 5 also indicates that no order of attachment shall be made unless in relation to a schedule offence a report has been forwarded to a Magistrate under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or a complaint has been filed by a person authorised to investigate the scheduled offence before a Magistrate or Court for taking cognizance of the scheduled offence. Thus, in cases where the scheduled offence is itself negated, the fundamental premise of continuing any proceedings under the Act also vanishes. Such cases where it is conclusively held that a  commission of a scheduled offence is not established and such decision has attained finality pose no difficulty; in such cases, the proceedings under the Act would fail.",

In my view, this contention is also not acceptable. If the crime, which has allegedly resulted in the proceeds attached under the Act, is not established, the basis of the attachment would cease to exist and the question of proceeding further under the Act would not arise. The trial for an offence of money-laundering is also predicated on commission of a scheduled crime and would have to be terminated. It is only in cases where it is found that a scheduled crime has been committed that the question of determining whether an offence of money-laundering is made out would survive. Thus, in cases where the persons accused of a scheduled offence are acquitted, the fundamental premise that any proceeds have been derived or obtained from any activity relating to a scheduled offence by either the persons accused or any other person linked to them would also not hold good and, therefore, any proceeding initiated under the Act would have to be terminated.‖  24 2016 SCC OnLine Del 475",

In view of what has been discussed above, I am of the view that the petitioner has been able to make out a good case for quashing of the summoning order for the simple reason that from the allegations made in the complaint, no offence under section 3 of the Money-Laundering Act is made out against the petitioner in view of the fact that the petitioner has been discharged from the scheduled offences and except the present complaint in which the impugned summoning order has been passed, no case is pending against him. The learned Sessions Judge while passing the impugned summoning order has not taken into account this fact that the petitioner has already been discharged of all the scheduled offences. The properties which were allegedly acquired by the petitioner during crime period, were also not acquired during the offence period, except the one of which sufficient explanation has been given by the petitioner. There was, thus, no sufficient ground to have summoned the petitioner for facing trial under section 3 of the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act. It is a settled law that summoning of a person to face trial in respect of an offence, is a serious matter and the court should examine in detail and record a finding that a person, prima facie, is guilty of an offence. A serious responsibility rests upon the courts before passing of the summoning order and the  court must be satisfied that there is sufficient material to proceed against the accused person. In the present case, the opposite parties concealed the material fact in the complaint that the petitioner had already been discharged from the scheduled offence and no trial was pending against him. The impugned summoning order was passed by the learned Sessions Judge assuming that the trial in respect of the schedule offence was pending against him while as a matter of fact, no such trial was pending on the date when the complaint was filed and the summoning order was passed. The impugned summoning order therefore suffers from manifest error of law and is liable to be quashed.”  25 2016 SCC OnLine All 2632",

The offence of money laundering, however, is not to be appreciated in isolation but is to be read with the complementary provisions, that is, the offences enlisted in the Schedule of the Act. The bare perusal of the abovementioned provisions of the PMLA establishes the pre-requisite relation between the commission of scheduled offences under the PMLA and the subsequent offence of money laundering. The language of Section 3 clearly implies that the money involved in the offence of money laundering is necessarily the proceeds of crime, arising out of a criminal activity in relation to the scheduled offences enlisted in the Schedule of the Act. Hence, the essential ingredients for the offence of Section 3 of the PMLA become, first, the proceeds of crime, second, proceeds of crime arising out of the offences specified in the Schedule of the Act and third, the factum of knowledge while commission of the offence of money laundering. In the present matter, at the initial stage of proceedings, the Respondents were charged for offences under Section 21/25/29 of the NDPS Act and 420/468/471/120B of the IPC, however, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Amritsar, observed that material produced before the Court as well as the allegations made against the Respondents were largely made upon suspicion. Though certain material, properties and cash, were recovered and attached/seized but the fact that such properties were obtained through proceeds of crime of drug trafficking could not be established.",

The Petitioner was not able to establish the allegations against the Respondents and as such the material produced was not sufficient to find guilt against them. Further, at the stage of framing of charges, the learned Additional Sessions Judge, had to only satisfy itself of the apprehension that whether the accused persons had committed the offences based on the material before it, without going into the extensive appreciation of the evidence. Since there was no material on record that casted a shadow of doubt over the Respondents, they were rightly discharged of the offences.

Dealing with the submission that consequent to closure of the criminal proceedings, action taken  under the Act would also be liable to be brought to a close, the Division Bench held as follows: - 27 2019 SCC OnLine Mad 13270  “14. As we do not have any quibble over the facts narrated, let us go into the issues raised. As rightly submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General, the definition of ―proceeds of crime‖ under Section 2(u) of the Act is very exhaustive and elaborate. It speaks of any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person. It is no doubt true that the complaint has been made by the respondent only in pursuant to the scheduled offence. However, the object, rationale and the scope enshrined under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, being a special statute is distinct and different from the one enshrined under the Penal Code, 1860 and the Prevention of Corruption Act. Though the facts may be overlapping the nature of investigation differs. Therefore, it cannot be stated that a mere closure by the Central Bureau of Investigation would provide a death knell to the proceedings of the respondent. In a given case, the complaint may emanate from a registration of a case involving scheduled offence. But the fate of the investigation in the said scheduled offence cannot have bearing to the proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Section 2(u) of the Act merely speaks of a criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. Therefore, we are concerned with the criminal activity qua a scheduled offence. Section 3 deals with the offence on money laundering. Once the respondent is of the view that a person is involved in any process of activity connected with the ―proceeds of crime‖, which definition is very wide then he gets the power to investigate further. When such an investigation gets completed and found that there indeed was a money laundering, then the matter will have to be proceeded with before the jurisdictional Court, on a complaint being taken on file. Hence, there is no difficulty in holding that both the investigations can go on using the same channel while their waters need not mix all the time.”",

Further, by way of Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 (23 of 2019), dated 01.08.2019, Section 44 of PML Act has been amended by inserting an explanation to clause (d) of sub-section (1), which reads as follows:  \"Explanation--For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that,--(i) the jurisdiction of the Special Court while dealing with the offence under this Act, during investigation, enquiry or trial under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of both sets of offences by the same court shall not be construed as joint trial.\"  The above explanation sets out in clear terms that trial of money laundering offence is independent trial and it is governed by its own provisions and it need not get interfered with the trial of scheduled offence. The PML Act, being a special enactment, contemplates a distinct procedure at the initial stage and thereafter provides for initiation of prosecution, in order to achieve the special purpose  - envisaged under the Act and as such, it cannot be construed that proceedings under the PML Act are to be equated with prosecution initiated under the criminal proceedings for predicate/scheduled offences. Thus, initiation of action under the PML Act cannot have any implication or impact in respect of registration of other cases, either under the Indian Penal Code or any other penal laws. The offence of money laundering contemplated under Section 3 of the PML Act is an independent offence. A reference to criminal activity relating to offence under PML Act has a wider connotation, and it may extend to a person, who is connected with criminal activity relating to scheduled offence, but may not be the offender of scheduled offence. It is in this background that it has to be necessarily held that offence under PML Act is a stand-alone offence. Keeping in view the same, if we look at subsection (b) of Section 44 of the PML Act, it would clearly indicate that the Special Court may take cognizance of the offence upon a complaint by authorized signatory, which means that cognizance would be taken of an offence, which is separate and independent. Even in case of a person who is initially not booked for a scheduled offence but booked later, and subsequently acquitted of the said scheduled offence, still such person can be proceeded under PML Act. It is not necessary that a person has to be prosecuted under the PML Act, only in the event of such person having committed scheduled offence. Prosecution can be independently initiated under PML Act only for the offence of money laundering.  29 MANU/TL/0588/2021",

Section 3 of PML Act further clarifies that a person shall be guilty of offence of money laundering, if such person is found to have directly or indirectly attempted to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in concealment, possession, acquisition, use, projecting as untainted property, claiming as untainted property and the process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime is a continuing activity, which itself shows the offence of money laundering is a continuing offence. Thus, a bare reading of Sections 2(1)(u), 3 and 44(1)(d) of PML Act along with explanations thereof makes it clear that the offence of money laundering is a standalone offence and the trial proceedings are completely different to that of the scheduled offence. Trial of money laundering offence is independent trial and it is governed by its own provisions, it will not meddle with the trial of scheduled offence.",

                        "content": "Similar question came up for consideration before the Hon'ble High Court of Madras in Smt. Soodamani Dorai Vs. Joint Directorate of Enforcement's case (supra) relied by the respondents, wherein, it was held that adjudication,  prosecution and trial under PML Act is independent of scheduled offence. It was held as follows:  \"In respect of the question whether criminal proceedings initiated by the police is a bar for proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the provisions of PMLA, 2002 are independent and having self-contained code. Before Amendment Act, 2012, the proceedings of PMLA, 2002 were fully depending upon the scheduled offence. However, after Amendment Act, 2012, with effect from 15.2.2013, the amendments were made in Sections 5(1), 8(3), 8(5), 8(6), 8(7) and 8(8) of the Act, which are very well evident that the proceedings are independent from scheduled offence proceedings. It would not be out of place to humbly submit herein that the provision of Section 5(1)(b) that ―such person has been charged of having committed a scheduled offence and‖ was deleted by the Amendment Act, 2012, with effect from 15.2.2013. In the case of Samsuddin v. Union of India, it has been held that the offence of money laundering is independent of scheduled offences and it has been further held that the time of commission of the scheduled offence is not relevant to the context of the prosecution under the Act.  The offence of money laundering is not covered under any other provisions of law. Section 3 enacted by 2002 Act is a new offence and stands by itself. Section 44(1)(c) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, it is: provided that if the Court which takes cognizance of the scheduled offences is other than the Special Court under the PMLA, the Authority should move an application for transfer of the scheduled offence to the Special Court and the Special Court, on receipt of such case, proceed to deal with it from the stage at which it is committed. Therefore, it is clear from the provisions of the Act that the offence of money laundering stands by itself. As evident from Section 8(6) of the Act, the Court will release the property only if it is found on the conclusion of trial under PMLA that the offence of money laundering has not taken place or if the property is not involved in money laundering. Therefore, adjudication, prosecution, trial under PMLA is independent of scheduled offence. This is also clear in view of Section 24 of the PMLA, 2002, which deals with burden of proof as it clearly stated that the burden of proof relating to proceeds of crime involved in money laundering is on the accused whereas the burden of proof in the scheduled offences is on the prosecution. Therefore, though the ECIR may have been registered following a scheduled offence, the property in possession of the person, against whom allegations are made, is found to be involved in money laundering, then he can be punished independently of the scheduled offence. Therefore, mere stay of the predicate offence is not a ground for preventing the Directorate of Enforcement from proceeding under the PMLA, 2002.",

The predicate offense does not merely represent the trigger for a charge of money laundering being raised but constitutes the very foundation on which that charge is laid. The entire edifice of a charge of money laundering is raised on an allegation of a predicate offense having been committed, proceeds of crime generated from such activity and a projection of the tainted property as untainted.

Mr. Chawla learned counsel addressing submissions on behalf of the petitioners in the connected writ petition additionally argued that since the aforenoted two provisions of the Penal Code were included in the Schedule only on 01 June 2009 and the properties provisionally attached had been purchased prior thereto, even on this score the proceedings impugned are rendered without jurisdiction and authority of law. Mr. Chawla argued that since these provisions came to be included as scheduled offenses only in 2009, any action initiated under the Act founded on a predicate offense which came to be included and recognised by inclusion in the Schedule subsequently would be violative of Article 20(1) of the Constitution.",

                        "content": "On a fundamental plane, Article 20(1) raises a constitutional injunction or bar in respect of penal action against a person for an act which was not an offense at the relevant time. It is to this extent that the provisions of penal statutes are constitutionally barred from operating retrospectively. The guiding expressions of  Article 20(1) are “violation of a law in force” and “at the time of the commission of the act charged….”. The Constitution thus constructs a negative command against penal action and conviction except for an offense created by a law which was in force at the time of commission of the act. The spirit of Article 20(1) was lucidly explained by the Supreme Court in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh vs. State of V.P.31 in the following words: - “8. Article 20(1) of the Constitution is as follows:  ―No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.‖  This article in its broad import has been enacted to prohibit convictions and sentences under ex post facto laws. The principle underlying such prohibition has been very elaborately discussed and pointed out in the very learned judgment of Justice Willes in the well-known case of Phillips v. Eyre [(1870) 6 QBD 1, at 23 and 25] and also by the Supreme Court of U.S.A. in Calder v. Bull [3 Dallas 386 : 1 Law Edition 648 at 649] . In the English case it is explained that ex post facto laws are laws which voided and punished what had been lawful when done. There can be no doubt as to the paramount importance of the principle that such ex post facto laws, which retrospectively create offences and punish them are bad as being highly inequitable and unjust. In the English system of jurisprudence repugnance of such laws to universal notions of fairness and justice is treated as a ground not for invalidating the law itself but as compelling a beneficent construction thereof where the language of the statute by any means permits it. In the American system, however, such ex post facto laws are themselves rendered invalid by virtue of Article 1, Sections 9 and 10 of its Constitution. It is contended by the learned Attorney-General that Article 20 of the Constitution was meant to bring about nothing more than the invalidity of such ex post facto laws in the post-Constitution period but that the validity of the pre-Constitution laws in this behalf was not intended to be affected in any way. The case in Keshavan Madhavan Menon v. State of Bombay [1951 SCR 228] has been relied on to show that the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution have no retrospective  operation, and that the invalidity of laws brought about by Article 13(1) of the Constitution relates only to the future operation of the pre-Constitution laws which are in violation of the fundamental rights. On this footing it was argued that even on the assumption of the convictions in this case being in respect of new offences created by Ordinance 48 of 1949 after the commission of the offences charged, the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 20 is not attracted thereto so as to invalidate such convictions. This contention, however, cannot be upheld. On a careful consideration of the respective articles, one is struck by the marked difference in language used in the Indian and American Constitutions. Sections 9(3) and 10 of Article 1 of the American Constitution merely say that ―No ex post facto law shall be passed….‖ and ―No State shall pass ex post facto law…‖. But in Article 20 of the Indian Constitution the language used is in much wider terms, and what is prohibited is the conviction of a person or his subjection to a penalty under ex post facto laws. The prohibition under the article is not confined to the passing or the validity of the law, but extends to the conviction or the sentence and is based on its character as an ex post facto law. The fullest effect must therefore be given to the actual words used in the article. Nor does such a construction of Article 20 result in giving retrospective operation to the fundamental right thereby recognised. All that it amounts to is that the future operation of the fundamental right declared in Article 20 may also in certain cases result from acts and situations which had their commencement in the pre-Constitution period. In Queen v. St. Mary Whitechapel [116 ER 811 at 814] Lord Denman, C.J. pointed out that a statute which in its direct operation is prospective cannot properly be called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing. The general principle therefore that the fundamental rights, have no retrospective operation is not in any way affected by giving the fullest effect to the wording of Article 20. This article must accordingly be taken to prohibit all convictions or subjections to penalty after the Constitution in respect of ex post facto laws whether the same was a post-Constitution law or a pre-Constitution law. That such is the intendment of the wording used in Article 20(1) is confirmed by the similar wording used in Articles 20(2) and 20(3). Under Article 20(2), for instance, it cannot be reasonably urged that the prohibition of double jeopardy applies only when both the occasions therefor arise after the Constitution. Similarly, under Article 20(3) it cannot be suggested that a person accused before the Constitution can be compelled to be a witness against himself, if after the Constitution the case is pending.‖  31 1953 SCR 1188",

This is evident from paragraph 10 of the report which is extracted hereinbelow: - “10. In this connection our attention has been drawn to the fact that the Vindhya Pradesh Ordinance 48 of 1949, though enacted on 11th September, 1949 i.e. after the alleged offences were committed, was in terms made retrospective by Section 2 of the said Ordinance which says that the Act ―shall be deemed to have been in force in Vindhya Pradesh from the 9th day of August, 1948,‖ a date long prior to the date of the commission of the offences. It was accordingly suggested that since such a law at the time when it was passed was a valid law and since this law had the effect of bringing this Ordinance into. force from 9th August, 1949, it cannot be said that the convictions are not in respect of ―a law in force‖ at the time when the offences were committed. This, however, would be to import a somewhat technical meaning into the phrase ―law in force‖ as used in Article 20. ―Law in force‖ referred to therein must be taken to relate not to a law ―deemed‖ to be in force and thus brought into force but the law factually in operation at the time or what may be called the then existing law. Otherwise, it is clear that the whole purpose of Article 20 would be completely defeated in its application even to ex post facto laws passed after the Constitution. Every such ex post facto law can be made retrospective, as it must be, if it is to regulate acts committed before the actual passing of the Act, and it can well be urged that by such retrospective operation it becomes the law in force at the time of the commencement of the Act. It is obvious that such a construction which nullifies Article 20 cannot possibly be adopted. It cannot therefore be doubted that the phrase ―law in force‖ as used in Article 20 must be understood in its natural sense as being the law in fact in existence and in operation at the time of the commission of the offence as distinct from the law ―deemed‖ to have become operative by virtue of the power of legislature to pass retrospective laws. It follows that if the appellants are able to substantiate their contention that the acts charged as offences in this case have become such only by virtue of Ordinance 48 of 1949 which has admittedly been passed subsequent to the commission thereof, then they would be entitled to the benefit of Article 20 of Constitution and to have their convictions set aside. This leads to an examination of the relevant pre-existing law.‖",

It does not create a separate punishment for a crime chronicled or prescribed under the Penal Code. The Act does not penalise the predicate offense. That offense merely constitutes the substratum for a charge of money laundering being raised. Undisputedly, the offense of money laundering rests on the commission of a predicate offense which in turn may have resulted in a pecuniary benefit being obtained and derived. It fundamentally aims at confiscation of benefits that may be derived as a result of criminal activity and the commission of a scheduled offense. It is aimed at countering and penalising the malaise of wealth and assets acquired as a result of criminal activity. Accordingly, while the commission of the predicate offense may be described as the sine qua non for an allegation of money laundering being laid against a person, it is an offense created independently owing its genesis to the Act which came to be promulgated on 01 July 2005. It would also be pertinent to note that while the punishment in respect of various crimes created under different statutes and which are included in the Schedule did exist prior to 01 July 2005, the crime of money laundering as set out in Section 3 came into being only on that date. Prior to 01 July 2005, there was undisputedly no law in force which constructed or statutorily prescribed an offense for money laundering and empowered the respondents to attach and confiscate proceeds of crime derived from criminal activity.",

However, and at the same time it must also be held that an offense of money laundering that may be committed post 01 July 2005 would still be subject to the rigours of the Act notwithstanding the predicate offense having been committed prior to that date. As noted hereinabove, Section 3 creates an offense for money laundering. Neither that provision nor the Act is concerned with the trial of the predicate offense. Thus, any activity or process that may be undertaken by a person post 01 July 2005 in terms of which proceeds of crime are acquired, possessed or used and/or projected as untainted property would still be subject to the provisions of the Act. This because it is the act of money laundering committed after the enforcement of the Act which is being targeted and not the predicate offense. The Court also bears in mind the Explanation (ii) to Section 3 which clarifies that money laundering is a continuing activity and continues till such time as the person is directly or indirectly “enjoying” the proceeds of crime by its concealment, possession, acquisition or use and/or projecting it as untainted property. The word “enjoying” clearly appears to have been consciously used in order to impress and convey its usage in its present and continuous form. Therefore, from a reading of Explanation (ii) also it is evident that the action that may be initiated under the Act is aimed at the offense of laundering of criminally acquired gains and profits and such activities and processes answering the description of money laundering which may occur or be indulged in after the Act has come into force. Accordingly, it must be held that while the commission of a predicate offense would constitute the bedrock for initiation of action, the date on which such an  offense may have been committed would be of little relevance provided an act of money laundering is alleged to have been committed after the Act had come into force.",

However, the subject of the offence continues to be the proceeds of crime and its involvement in money-laundering.

                        "content": "The Act is a penal statute and, therefore, can have no retrospective or retroactive operation. Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India expressly forbids that no person can be convicted of any offence except for the violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence. Further, no person can be inflicted a penalty greater than what could have been inflicted under the law at the time when the offence was committed. Clearly, no proceedings under the Act can be initiated or sustained in respect of an offence, which has been committed prior to the Act coming into force. However, the subject matter of the Act is not a scheduled offence but the offence of money-laundering. Strictly speaking, it cannot be contended that the Act has a retrospective operation because it now enacts that laundering of proceeds of crime committed earlier as an offence. In The Queen v. The Inhabitants of St. Mary, Whitechapel (1848) 12 QB 120, the Court pointed out that ―The Statute which in its direct operation of prospective cannot be properly be called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for that action is drawn from the time antecedent to its passing‖. Thus, with effect from 1st June, 2009 laundering proceeds of crime under Section 420 of the IPC is enacted as an offence of money-laundering punishable under  Section 4 of the Act. It is important to note that the punishment under Section 4 of the Act is not for commission of a scheduled offence but for laundering proceeds of a scheduled crime. The fact that the scheduled crime may have been committed prior to the Act coming into force would not render the Act a retrospective statute as only the offence of money-laundering committed after the enforcement of the Act can be proceeded against under the Act.",

                        "content": "The next contention to be considered is whether in the given facts and circumstances, any offence or money-laundering had been made out to warrant an issuance of the impugned order. It is alleged that on 10th February, 2005, MIL through its Director issued cheques aggregating Rs. 1.5 crores in favour of its holding companies, namely, M/s. Duoroyale Enterprises Ltd. and M/s. Shri Radhey Trading Pvt. Ltd. and these companies in turn issued two cheques of Rs. 75 lacs each in favour of the petitioner. It is suggested that these amounts were proceeds of crime received by the petitioner as a result of a criminal activity and bulk of these funds were utilized by the petitioner for paying the consideration for acquiring the property in question. It was argued that all actions of integrating the money by purchase of immovable property would fall within the definition of ‗money-laundering‘. In this respect it is relevant to note that the sale deed in respect of the property was executed on 18.03.2005. Thus, even if the allegations made by the respondent are assumed to be correct, the proceeds of crime had been used by the petitioner for acquisition of the property much prior to the Act coming into force. The process of activity of utilising the proceeds of crime, if any, thus, stood concluded prior to the Act coming into force. Even if it is assumed that the funds received from M/s. Duoroyale Enterprises Ltd. and M/s. Shri Radhey Trading Pvt. Ltd. were proceeds of crime and were properties involved in money-laundering, such funds had come into possession of the petitioner prior to the Act coming into force. Thus, funds were already projected as untainted funds unconnected with the crime for which Mr. Homi Rajvansh and other persons are accused. The funds had, thus, been laundered at a time when money-laundering was not an offence and proceedings under the Act cannot be initiated.",

                        "content": "Although, the Respondent has not contended so in clear terms, it appears that the respondents are proceeding on the basis that an offence under Section 3 of the Act is a continuing offence. According to the respondent, the possession of any property linked to a scheduled offense irrespective of when it was acquired would itself constitute the offence of money-laundering. It is important to understand the  import of such interpretation. This would mean that a person who has committed a scheduled crime; acquired proceeds therefrom; and thereafter, projected it as untainted money, prior to the Act coming into force, would nonetheless be guilty of the offence of money-laundering only for the reason that he is in possession of some property. This is so because the definition of proceeds of crime also includes the value of any property derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled crime. Further any such property -even in the hands of a person not accused of the scheduled crime or offense of money-laundering -would also be subject to the proceedings under the Act. Thus, practically, a person guilty of a scheduled offence who has acquired any benefit in relation to the scheduled offence would in effect also be guilty of the offence of money-laundering immediately on the Act coming into force. If such an interpretation is sought to be provided, the grievance of the petitioner that a penal provision is sought to be given a retrospective operation would be justified and this would clearly offend Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India as an offender of a scheduled crime would now be visited with a greater punitive measure than as could be inflicted at the time when the scheduled offence was committed. Given the wide definition of ―proceeds of crime‖ it would be contended that irrespective of how far back in the past a scheduled offence was committed, the authorities could nonetheless try persons for an offence of money-laundering as well as confiscate the value of the property alleged to have been derived or obtained by criminal activity relating to the scheduled offence. This would be notwithstanding that the proceeds derived from a scheduled offence have undergone significant changes and have been integrated in legitimate economic activity. The properties could also be traced in the hands of persons unconnected with the scheduled offence. There is no indication from the express language of the Act, that the Legislature intended the Act to be retroactive or operative with retrospective effect.",

The expression money-laundering would ordinarily imply the conversion and infusion of tainted money into the main stream of economy as legitimate wealth. According to the respondent, there are three stages to a transaction of money-laundering : The first stage is Placement, where the criminals place the proceeds of the crime into normal financial system. The second stage is Layering, where money introduced into the normal financial system is layered or spread into various transactions within the financial system so that any link with the origin of the wealth is lost. And, the third stage is Integration, where the benefit or proceeds of crime are available with the criminals as untainted money. There is much merit in this description of money-laundering and this also indicates that, by its nature, the offence of money- laundering has to be constituted by determinate actions and the process or activity of money-laundering is over once the third stage of integration is complete. Thus, unless such acts have been committed after the Act came into force, an offence of money-laundering punishable under Section 4 would not be made out. The 2013 Amendment to Section 3 of the Act by virtue of which the words ―process or activity connected with proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property‖ were substituted by the words ―any process or activity connected with proceeds of crime including concealment, possession, acquisition or use and projecting or claiming it as untainted property‖. The words ―concealment, possession, acquisition or use‖ must be read in the context of the process or activity of money-laundering and this is over once the money is laundered and integrated into the economy. Thus, a person concealing or coming into possession or bringing proceeds of crime to use would have committed the offence of money-laundering when he came into possession or concealed or used the proceeds of crime. For any offence of money-laundering to be alleged, such acts must have been done after the Act was brought in force. The proceeds of crime which had come into possession and projected and claimed as untainted prior to the Act coming into force, would be outside the sweep of the Act.",

In other words, the Act deals only with the process or activity with the proceeds of the crime including its concealment, possession, acquisition or use. Article 20(1) of the Constitution prohibits conviction except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. In other words, there cannot be any prosecution under the Act for laundering of money acquired by committing the scheduled offences prior to the introduction of the Act. The time of commission of the scheduled offences is therefore not relevant in the context of the prosecution under the Act. What is relevant in the context of the prosecution is the time of commission of the act of money laundering.

Petitioners appear to have put forward the plea of post facto law on the premise that the acts constituting the offences alleged against them were perpetrated prior to the amendment of the schedule to the PML Act and therefore, the action initiated against them falls within the mischief of Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India. This contention, in my view, in the factual setting of the case, is totally misplaced and misconceived and appears to have been canvassed by misconstruing the provisions of sections 3, 2(1)(u) and the Schedule appended to the PML Act. No-doubt, it is true that the Schedule to the PML Act was amended by Act 21 of 2009 and the various offences specified therein came to be included therein with effect from 1.06.2009. Nonetheless, in the instant cases, as on the date of initiation of action against petitioners, be it under section 3 or under section 5 of the PML Act, these provisions were very much there in the statute book. As already stated above, in all the cases, the prosecution under section 3 of the PML Act and adjudication proceedings under section 5 of the PML Act have been initiated against the petitioners subsequent to 1.06.2009. Therefore, the contention urged by learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that the petitioners are sought to be prosecuted on the basis of ex post facto laws is factually incorrect.",

                        "content": "From the plain reading of section 3 read with section 2(1)(u) of the PML Act, it is clear that what is made punishable under section 3 is the activity connected with the proceeds of crime either by getting oneself involved in the process or activity connected thereto or directly or indirectly attempting to indulge or knowingly assist or knowingly be a party to the alleged activities and projecting it as untainted property, whereas the components of the offences under section 13 of the PC Act and Sections 120-B, 419, 420 and other IPC offences are entirely different. The prosecution under section 3 of the PML Act, by no stretch of imagination, could be equated with the prosecution under section 13 of the PC Act or other offences specified in the Schedule namely IPC or other laws. They are distinct and separate offences. Prosecution under section 3 of PML Act is not based on the outcome of the trial of the offenders under section 13 of the PC Act. A reading of section 3 of PML Act in unamended form would clearly indicate that even without there being any conviction of the accused in a predicate offence and even if the offender under section 3 of the PML Act is not a party to the predicate offence, still the prosecution could be launched against him if the offender is found involved in any process or activity connected with the 'proceeds of crime'. What is necessary to constitute the offence of money laundering is the existence of proceeds of crime and not the pendency of predicate offence as vehemently  contended by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners. This Court as well as various other Courts have analysed this provision and have consistently held that the offences under section 3 of the PML Act is an independent and stand alone offence. Therefore, the argument of learned counsel for petitioners that without the existence of predicate offence and without there being any conviction of the petitioners for the predicate offence, their prosecution for the offence of money-laundering cannot be sustained being contrary to the language of section 3 of the PML Act and the intendment of the Legislature in enacting section 3 of the PML Act and the allied provisions is liable to be rejected and is accordingly rejected.",

Union of India, Ministry of Finance, North Block, Department of Revenue and others, had an opportunity to examine the various provisions of PML Act while deciding the constitutionality or validity of the sections 2(1) (u), 3, 5, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24 and 44 of the PML Act 2002(as amended from time to time) and held that:- \"Money laundering is a stand alone offence. A person who has not committed a scheduled offence could be prosecuted for an offence of money laundering. In such a situation, the prosecution need not wait for the scheduled offence to be established. It can independently prosecute and lay material to show that he had knowingly assisted or was responsible for laundering of the illicit wealth. In such a situation, the property would then stand attached and the person who is being prosecuted for money laundering has to show the Court that he is not guilty of money laundering. The same would work to his advantage as to whether a scheduled offence has been committed or not. He could show that the property in question has not come in his possession and that he has not knowingly appropriated the same. In such a situation, if the offence is not established, the property would revert back to him.  The changes that were brought about to Sections 5 and 8 synchronize with other provisions contained in the Act. Section 44, which now stands amended contemplates trial of both, the scheduled offence and the offence of money laundering by the same Special Court. In these circumstances, there is no likelihood of conflict of orders relating to the said offences.\"",

                        "content": "The correlation between possession and acquisition of the subject matter of a crime which is made an offence post facto has been considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan, MANU/SC/0465/2015 : (2015) 6 SCC 222 : (AIR 2015 SC 2098), in the context of possession of contraband substance under NDPS Act. In the said case, the appellant/accused therein was  convicted and punished under section 18 of the NDPS Act when admittedly the theft of contraband substance was committed prior to coming into force of NDPS Act. The FIR was registered against the appellant/accused therein prior to coming into force of NDPS Act and therefore a contention was taken before the Court that the possession of contraband substance having commenced prior to coming into force of the NDPS Act i.e., when the theft was committed on the intervening night of 12/13-11-1985 whereas the NDPS Act came into force on 14.11.1985, the accused cannot be subjected to an offence under a new Act which was not in force on the date of theft and possession of the contraband articles. Analyzing the concept of possession in the context of section 18 of the NDPS Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the aspect of conscious possession as well as mens rea and animus to possess contraband substance and came to the conclusion that the animus and mental intent which is the primary and significant element to show and establish possession could be established from the personal knowledge as to the existence of the 'chattel', that is the illegal substance at a particular location of site, at a relevant time and the intention based upon the knowledge, would constitute the unique relationship and manifest possession. The Hon'ble Supreme Court further went on to hold that \"in such a situation, presence and existence of possession could be justified for the intention is to exercise right over the substance of chattel and to act as the owner to the exclusion of others.\"  52  . After dealing with the concept of 'possession', the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the issue as to whether the appellant could be convicted and sentenced under the Opium Act, as that was the law in force at the time of commission of an offence and if he is convicted under section 18 of the NDPS Act, whether it would tantamount to retrospective operation of law imposing penalty which is prohibited, under Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:- Article 20(1) gets attracted only when any penal law penalises with retrospective effect i.e. when an act was not an offence when it was committed and additionally the persons cannot be subjected to penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence. The Article prohibits application of ex post facto law. In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Anr. v. State of Vindhya Pradesh [MANU/SC/0010/1955 : AIR 1955 SC 446], while dealing with the import under Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India, the Court stated what has been prohibited under the said Article is the conviction and sentence in a criminal proceeding under ex post facto law and not the trial thereof. The Constitution Bench has held that:- \"9. ... what is prohibited under Article 20 is only conviction or sentence under an 'ex post facto' law and not the trial thereof. Such trial under a procedure different from what obtained at the time of the commission  of the offence or by a Court different from that which had competence at the time cannot 'ipso facto' be held to be unconstitutional. A person accused of the commission of a particular Court or by a particular procedure, except in so far as any constitutional objection by way of discrimination or the violation of any other fundamental right may be involved.\"  In the instant case, Article 20(1) would have no application. The actus of possession is not punishable with retrospective affect. No offence is created under Section 18 of the NDPS Act with retrospective effect. What is punishable is possession of the prohibited article on or after a particular date when the statute was enacted, creating the offence or enhancing the punishment. Therefore, if a person is in possession of the banned substance on the date when the NDPS Act was enforced, he would commit the offence, for on the said date he would have both the 'corpus' and 'animus' necessary in law.\"  (underlining supplied)",

The reference to \"scheduled offence\" under section 2(1) (y) of the PML Act is only an indicator or a pointer that the properties laundered by the offenders had their origin or source in any of the offence or crime specified in the schedule and therefore the offenders are liable to answer the charge under section 3 punishable under section 4 of the PML Act. In the light of this legal and factual position, I am unable to accept the submission of learned counsel for petitioners that they are the victims of ex post facto laws offending the constitutional protection granted to them under Article 20(1) of the Constitution of India.‖",

Section 5 relates to attachment of the property involved in money laundering. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid provision of the PML Act that commission of a schedule offence is not a fundamental precondition for initiating proceedings under the PML Act, since the offence of money laundering is independent of schedule offence. From a plain reading of the PML Act or on a conjoint reading of the provisions of the PML Act, it would leave no manner of doubt that it deals only with laundering of money acquired by committing the scheduled offence. To put it differently, the PML Act deals only with the process or activity with the proceeds of crime including its concealment, possession or use.

Dispute, however, is likely to arise in relation to attachment or confiscation upon questions being raised at the instance of the person suspected of money-laundering (or his abettor) as to sufficiency of the material or reasons to believe for such action, as indeed of the fairness or propriety of the procedure followed. Dispute may also arise in such context if the property has been transferred to another person, after it had been acquired by the transaction relatable to money-laundering and before its attachment under PMLA.

Since the second of the above species of ―proceeds of crime‖ uses the expression ―such property‖, the qualifying word being ―such‖, it is vivid that the ―property‖ referred to here is equivalent to the one indicated by the first kind. The only difference is that it  is not the same property as of the first kind, it having been picked up from among other properties of the accused, the intent of the legislature being that it must be of the same ―value‖ as the former.

But, for this to be a fair exercise, the empowered enforcement officer must assess (even if tentatively), and re-evaluate, as the investigation into the case progresses, the quantum of ―proceeds of crime‖ derived or obtained from the criminal activity so that proceeds or other assets of equivalent value of the offender of money-laundering (or his abettor) are subjected to attachment to such extent, the eventual order of confiscation being always restricted to take over by the Government of illicit gains of crime, the burden of proving facts to the contrary being on the person who so contends.",

The second kind of property which Axis Bank has recognised as falling within the ambit of Section 2(1)(u) was described to be untainted property and was explained to be that which may have been acquired “by the suspect legitimately without any connection with criminal activity or its result”. According to the learned Judge, such property would also fall within the scope of the Act since the person holding an interest in such property is found involved in the proscribed criminal activity and in a situation where the tainted assets held by him are either not traceable or cannot be reached. These properties were described in Axis Bank to be “alternative attachable property” or “deemed tainted property”. Axis Bank appears to take note of an exigency where an asset or property which may be directly or indirectly connected to criminal activity may not be traceable. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the learned Judge appears to have interpreted the phrase ―or the value of any such property‖ and thus enabling the Directorate to proceed even against such property in which the accused may have had an interest notwithstanding the fact that the same may not have a direct or indirect relationship with the criminal activity itself.

An order of attachment under PMLA is not rendered illegal only because a secured creditor has a prior secured interest (charge) in the subject property. Conversely, mere issuance of an order of attachment under PMLA cannot, by itself, render illegal the prior charge or encumbrance of a secured creditor, this subject to such claim of the third party (secured creditor) being bonafide. In these conflicting claims, a balance has to be struck. On account of exercise of the prerogative of the State under PMLA, the lawful interest of a third party which may have acted bonafide, and with due diligence, cannot be put in jeopardy. The claim of bonafide third party claimant cannot be sacrificed or defeated. A contrary view would be unfair and unjust and, consequently, not the intention of the legislature. The legislative scheme itself justifies this view.

In case such property is held by the person who is ―charged with the offence of money-laundering‖, there is a statutory presumption under Section 24(a) PMLA, using the expression ―shall presume‖, about it being proceeds of crime involved in such money-laundering. It is a rebuttable presumption, the onus to prove facts to the contrary being on the person accused of such offence. If the acquisition of such property by such accused has involved more than one ―interconnected transactions‖, one of such transactions being proved to be involving money-laundering, a statutory presumption is raised under Section 23 PMLA that the other transactions form part of the former, the burden to prove facts to the contrary being again on the person claiming otherwise.",

The learned Judge while proceeding to notice the aforesaid conflicts which may arise also culled out certain salutary safeguards with respect to such interests. Axis Bank holds that in order to recognise a right inhering in the respondents to proceed against such property, it must be established that there was ―some nexus or link between such property on one hand and the person accused or charged of money laundering on the other‖. It further held that in such cases it would have to be found that the person accused of money laundering had an interest in such property at least till the time of engagement in the proscribed criminal activity from which a pecuniary interest had been derived or obtained. It was on a construction of the provisions of the Act as such as well as the intent of the legislation itself that the learned Judge recognised and held that property equivalent to the tainted asset which had been derived or obtained from criminal activity may also be subject to attachment and confiscation under the Act notwithstanding a legitimate third-party interest existing in the same. It also held that such a third party claiming an interest in that property would always have the right to approach the Adjudicating Authority and establish that the property had been acquired bona fide, for lawful consideration and absent any intent of the acquisition being aimed at defeating or frustrating the objectives of the Act itself. It also pertinently held that interest acquired in deemed tainted property prior to the period during which the criminal  activity was undertaken would be free from the rigours and penal provisions of the Act.

Counsel for both sides have cited judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of Abdullah Ali Balsharaf v. Directorate of Enforcement (2019) 3 RCR (Cri) 798 to support their contention. As per said judgment, if property derived or obtained from scheduled offence is taken or held outside India, the property of equivalent value held in India or abroad may be attached irrespective of date of purchase. We fully subscribe to the opinion expressed by Delhi High Court. We find that third limb of definition ‗proceeds of crime‘ covers property equivalent to property held or taken outside India, thus date of purchase of property which is equivalent to property held outside India, is irrelevant.

If any property is permitted or held liable to be attached irrespective of its date of purchase, it would amount to declaring second and third limb of definition of ‗proceeds of crime‘ one and same. As pointed out by counsel for Appellants, the third limb of definition clause was inserted by Act 20 of 2015. The aforesaid 3rd limb has been further amended w.e.f. 19.04.2018 enlarging the scope. The question arises that if phrases ‗value of such property‘ and ‗property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad‘ are of same connotation and carry same meaning, there was no need to insert third limb in the definition of ‗proceeds of crime‘. The amendment made by legislature cannot be meaningless or without reasons. Use of different words and insertion of third limb in the definition cannot be ignored or interpreted casually. Every word chosen by legislature deserves to be given full meaning and effect. Accordingly, words ‗value of such property‘ and ‗property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad‘ cannot be given same meaning and effect. Had there been intention of legislature to include any property in the hands of any person within the ambit of proceeds of crime, there was no need to make three limbs of definition of proceeds of crime. It was very easy and convenient to declare that any property in the hands of a person who has directly or indirectly at any point of time had obtained or derived property from scheduled offence. There was even no need to declare property derived or obtained from scheduled offence as proceeds of crime. The legislature w.e.f. 01.08.2019 has inserted explanation in Section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA. As per Mr. Mittal, counsel for the Respondents, the said explanation enlarges scope of first limb of definition ‗proceeds of crime‘ and does not affect second limb of definition. We find some substance in the contention of Respondents, however it is trite law that entire scheme of the Act must be read as a whole/in its entirety and every provision should be read in such a manner that it makes other provisions and scheme of Act coherent and meaningful. A provision cannot be read in isolation. The definition part does not create rights and liabilities, thus it should be examined in the light of other sections which create rights and liabilities. As per Section 8(1) of the PMLA, the Adjudicating Authority has to serve notice calling upon the person to indicate the source of his income, earning or assets out of which or by means of which he has acquired the property attached under Section 5 of the PMLA. Seeking explanation about source of property and furnishing explanation is meaningless if property inspite of genuine and explained source may be attached. As per Section 24 of the PMLA, burden to prove that property is not involved in money laundering is upon the person whose property is attached. There is no sense on the part of any person to discharge burden qua source of property if any property may be attached, irrespective of its source.",

Section 2(1)(u) consequently as it stood originally included both property derived or obtained directly or indirectly by a person indulging in criminal activity as well as the value of any such property. The phrase ―property equivalent in value‖ came to be introduced by virtue of the 2015 Amendment to the Act and while dealing  with a situation where property is taken or held outside the country. To deal with such a situation, the Legislature by virtue of the 2015 Amendment also empowered the Directorate in such a contingency to initiate action against property equivalent in value held within the country itself. The words ―or abroad‖ came to be included in the third limb of Section 2(1)(u) by virtue of the 2018 Amendment to the Act.  The Court also bears in mind the Explanation which came to be added to Section 2(1)(u) which further sheds light on the expansive sweep of Section 2(1)(u) and prescribes that proceeds of crime would also extend to ―any property‖ which may be directly or indirectly derived or obtained as a result of any criminal activity.",

The phrase ―equivalent in value‖ cannot be understood or interpreted to control the first or the second limb of Section 2(1)(u). The expression ―value of any such property” always stood hinged to the first limb of the definition of proceeds of crime.

It is to confer authority upon the Directorate to proceed further in such a situation that Section 2(1)(u) uses the expression ―or the value of any such property‖. The safeguard which stands constructed in Section 2(1)(u) in such a contingency is that in case the Directorate does proceed against any other property, it must be equivalent in value to the illegal pecuniary benefit or gain that may have been obtained as a result of criminal activity.",

                        "content": "In the considered opinion of this Court to tie the Directorate‘s power to move forward in this direction only in cases where property is taken or held outside the country would not only do violence to the plain language of Section 2(1)(u), it would clearly whittle down the scope and intent of the definition itself. It would essentially amount to erasing the expression ―value of any such property‖ as appearing in Section 2(1)(u) altogether. The Court further notes that in Seema Garg the learned Judges themselves observed that the phrase ―value of any such property‖ would not mean and include any property which has no link, direct or indirect, with property derived or obtained from commission of a scheduled offence. The Court observes that Section 2(1)(u) clearly and in unambiguous terms includes not only property derived or obtained directly or indirectly as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence but also the value of any such property. Seema Garg thus seems to gloss over the statutory imperatives underlying the deployment of the phrase ―or the value of any such property‖ and the concept of deemed tainted properties enunciated in Axis Bank. On a plain textual interpretation of Section 2(1)(u) as well as in the  backdrop of the amendatory history of that provision, this Court finds itself unable to agree with the line of reasoning adopted in Seema Garg. As held hereinbefore, affirmation of Seema Garg would amount to virtually deleting the phrase ―or the value of any such property‖ from Section 2(1)(u). That would not only violate the well settled tenets of statutory construction but would clearly amount to the Court rewriting the provision itself in a manner that it stands deprived of vital and purposive content. The Court further notes that Axis Bank had enunciated important safeguards which would apply in respect of third-party interests in deemed tainted property. Those caveats duly secure and protect bona fide third-party interests created for valid consideration. This Court, thus, reaffirms those defences as were culled out in Axis Bank. The Court thus reiterates the interpretation accorded to Section 2(1)(u) by this Court in the aforesaid decision. Consequently, and for all the aforesaid reasons this Court finds itself unable to agree with the principles as laid down in Seema Garg as well as the subsequent decisions rendered by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kumar Pappu Singh Vs. Union of India34 and the Patna High Court in HDFC Bank Limited Vs Government of India, Ministry of Finance35 . In Kumar Pappu Singh, the High Court held thus: - ―24. The Division Bench held that the property derived from the offence would be proceeds of the crime and as such any property purchased or acquired before the commission of the offence would not fall within the first limb of the definition of ―proceeds of crime‖. It also held that if such property is moved abroad, any property of the accused available within India, irrespective of the date of acquisition, can be attached as proceeds of crime, as the same would fall within  the third limb of the definition. However, the Division Bench held, on the ambit of ―value of such property‖, that this term is not the same as the term ―property equivalent in value held within the Country or abroad‖, which appears in the third limb, and the same meaning cannot be given to both terms. While explaining the scope of the term ―value of such property‖, the division bench took the view that if some properties are obtained by committing an offence and are sold prior to the registration of the F.I.R. or ESIR, the money generated from sale or transfer of such property in the form of cash or any other form of property, which is available for attachment would answer the description ―value of such property‖.

What was the common law before the making of the Act.  2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide.  3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the Commonwealth, and  4th.

In Eastman Photographic Material Company v. Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks [LR [1898] A.C. 571 at 576] Earl of Halsbury reaffirmed the Rule as follows:  ―My Lords, it appears to me that to construe the Statute in question, it is not only legitimate but highly convenient to refer both to the former Act and to the ascertained evils to which the former Act had given rise, and to the later Act which provided the remedy. These three being compared I cannot doubt the conclusion.‖ It appears to us that this rule is equally applicable to the construction of Article 286 of our Constitution. In order to properly interpret the provisions of that article it is, therefore, necessary to consider how the matter stood immediately before the Constitution came into force, what the mischief was for which the old law did not provide and the remedy which has been provided by the Constitution to cure that mischief.",

A similar issue was there before a Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Seema Garg v. Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement reported in 2020 SCC OnLine P&H 738. The Hon'ble High Court elaborately considered the issue and held as follows:  ―31. Property purchased prior to commission of scheduled offence leaving aside date of enactment of PMLA, does not fall within ambit of first limb of definition of ‗proceeds of crime‘, however it certainly falls within purview and ambit of third limb of the definition. Counsel for both sides have cited judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of Abdullah Ali Balsharaf v. Directorate of Enforcement (2019) 3 RCR (Cri) 798 to support their contention. As per said judgment, if property derived or obtained from scheduled offence is taken or held outside India, the property of equivalent value held in India or abroad may be attached irrespective of date of purchase. We fully subscribe to the opinion expressed by Delhi High Court. We find that third limb of definition ‗proceeds of crime‘ covers property equivalent to property held or taken outside India, thus date of purchase of property which is equivalent to property held outside India, is irrelevant. Any property irrespective of date of purchase may be attached if property derived or obtained from scheduled offence is held or taken outside India.",

If any property is permitted or held liable to be attached irrespective of its date of purchase, it would amount to declaring second and third limb of definition of ‗proceeds of crime‘ one and same. As pointed out by counsel for Appellants, the third limb of definition clause was inserted by Act 20 of 2015. The aforesaid 3rd limb has been further amended w.e.f. 19.04.2018 enlarging the scope. The question arises that if phrases ‗value of such property‘ and ‗property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad‘ are of same connotation and carry same meaning, there was no need to insert third limb in the definition of ‗proceeds of crime‘. The amendment made by legislature cannot be meaningless or without reasons. Use of different words and insertion of third limb in the definition cannot be ignored or interpreted casually. Every word chosen by legislature deserves to be given full meaning and effect. Accordingly, words ‗value of such property‘ and ‗property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad‘ cannot be given same meaning and effect. Had there been intention of legislature to include any property in the hands of any person within the ambit of proceeds of crime, there was no need to make three limbs of definition of proceeds of crime.

We find some substance in the contention of Respondents, however it is trite law that entire scheme of the Act must be read as a whole/in its entirety and every provision should be read in such a manner that it makes other provisions and scheme of Act coherent and meaningful. A provision cannot be read in isolation. The definition part does not create rights and liabilities, thus it should be examined in the light of other sections which create rights and liabilities. As per Section 8(1) of the PMLA, the Adjudicating Authority has to serve notice calling upon the person to indicate the source of his income, earning or assets out of which or by means of which he has acquired the property attached under Section 5 of the PMLA. Seeking explanation about source of property and furnishing explanation is meaningless if property inspite of genuine and explained source may be attached.

The aforesaid allocation ultimately came to be  quashed on 24 September 2014 by the Supreme Court in Manohar Lal Sharma. However, much before that verdict coming to be rendered, CBI on 07 April 2010 registered FIR No. RC/AC2/2010/A0001 alleging misrepresentation by PIL in order to obtain the coal allocation as well as diversion of coal extracted from the said block. The Special Judge CBI framed charges against PIL and other accused in C.C. No. 3 of 2012. That chargesheet was challenged by PIL before this Court which on 05 September 2014 quashed the FIR as well as the consequential chargesheet which was submitted.

In Manohar  Lal Sharma36 , the Supreme Court extensively reviewed the system of allocation of coal blocks by the Union Government and explained that procedure as entailing the following steps. The allocation letter enabled the recipient to apply to the appropriate State Government for grant of a prospecting license or a mining lease dependent upon whether the block had been previously explored or not. The applicant was thereafter required to have a mining plan duly approved. The State Government on receipt of that plan was required to obtain the prior consent of the Union whereafter and upon receipt of environmental clearance and other statutory permissions, a mining lease would be granted by that Government. The nature of the right conferred on the allocatee by virtue of the allocation letter was explained by the Supreme Court in Manohar Lal Sharma in the following terms: - “75. We are unable to accept the submission of the learned Attorney General that allocation of coal block does not amount to grant of largesse. It is true that allocation letter by itself does not authorise the allottee to win or mine the coal but nevertheless the allocation letter does confer a very important right upon the allottee to apply for grant of prospecting licence or mining lease. As a matter of fact, it is admitted by the interveners that allocation letter issued by the Central Government provides rights to the allottees for obtaining the coal mines leases for their end-use plants. The banks, financial institutions, land acquisition authorities, revenue authorities and various other entities and so also the State Governments, who ultimately grant prospecting licence or mining lease, as the case may be, act on the basis of the letter of allocation issued by the Central Government. As noticed earlier, the allocation of coal block by the Central Government results in the selection of beneficiary which entitles the beneficiary to get the prospecting licence and/or mining lease from the State Government. Obviously, allocation of a coal block amounts to grant of largesse.",

The allocation letter, therefore, confers a valuable right in favour of the allottee. Obviously, therefore, such allocation has to meet the twin constitutional tests, one, the distribution of natural resources that vest in the State is to subserve the common good and, two, the allocation is not violative of Article 14.”  36 (2014) 9 SCC 516",

The holder of the allocation letter thus became entitled to the grant of a lease or a permission to win minerals which always did and continued to vest in the State. The mining lease embodied the conferment of a right by the State which owned the land and the mineral deposits to enjoy that property, to extract minerals on terms and conditions specified in the lease. The position of the lessee under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 essentially remains the same with the ownership of the land and the mineral deposit vesting in the appropriate government and a right to obtain a lease for excavation of mineral alone being conferred and parted with. On a consideration of the procedure for allotment of coal blocks and their allotment, it is manifest that the allocation of a coal block cannot stricto sensu be construed either as property or conferment of a right in property. It becomes pertinent to note that the expression property is defined by Section 2(1)(v) as property or assets of every description. The allocation at best represents a right conferred by the Union enabling the holder thereof to apply to the concerned State Government for grant of a mining lease. The allocation cannot per se be recognised as representing proceeds of crime. It would be the subsequent and consequential utilisation of that allocation, the working of the lease that may be granted, the generation of revenues from such operations and  the investment of those wrongfully obtained monetary gains that can possibly give rise to an allegation of money laundering. It is the financial gains that may be derived and obtained or proceeds generated from such allocation which could be considered as falling within the net of Section 2(1)(u).",

It is this aim and intent that the Act purports to subserve. The offense of money laundering was explained by the Court of Appeals in JSC BTA Bank Vs.

According to Mr. Raju, as long as that special leave petition remains pending, it cannot be said that finality stands attached to the decision of this Court quashing the aforesaid chargesheet. The Court may only observe that the mere pendency of that petition before the Supreme Court cannot legally be construed as amounting to a revival or continuance of the criminal proceedings which were initiated in terms of the aforenoted chargesheet and ultimately came to be quashed by this Court. As long as the judgment quashing the first chargesheet remains intact and untouched, this Court would have to proceed on the premise that no predicate offense was evidently committed. The submission of Mr. Raju that the proceedings are thus yet to attain finality is consequentially negatived.",

However, both the italicised categories would be liable to be invoked in cases where the actual tainted property cannot be traced or found out. It is only where the respondents are unable to discover the tainted property that they can take the statutory recourse to move against properties which may fall within the ambit of ―value of any such property‖ or ―property equivalent in value held within the country or abroad‖. To the aforesaid limited extent, properties purchased prior to 01 July 2005 may also become vulnerable and subject to action under the Act. However, enforcement action against such properties would have to satisfy the tests and safeguards as propounded in Axis Bank with the learned Judge observing that in such a situation it would have to be established that the person accused of money laundering had an interest in such property at least till the time that he indulged in the proscribed criminal activity.

This the Court observes notwithstanding it having already found that the allocation did not constitute proceeds of crime, that the second chargesheet stood restricted upto 04 September 2003 and the quashing of the first chargesheet brought all allegations of criminal activity allegedly indulged in post that date to an end. In fact and to the contrary, the provisional order of attachment proceeds on the basis that the promoter/Directors of Prakash Industries indirectly exercised majority control over the entities in whose names properties were purchased. This included Hi Tech Mercantile one of the petitioners in the second writ petition. The provisional attachment order further records that by virtue of the majority shares held by the Promoter/Directors of Prakash Industries in their sister concerns, they would be deemed to be the owners of the assets detailed in Paragraph 7.1 ―through themselves or through the said promoter companies/LLPs‖. Thus, the properties provisionally attached and mentioned in Paragraph 7.1 are asserted to be directly related to the laundering of proceeds of crime.

At the cost of repetition, it may be noted that the chargesheet bids us to restrict scrutiny of events upto 04 September 2003. Thus, if at all the proceedings could have been salvaged only in respect of those properties which may have been derived from proceeds of crime obtained upto that date.

Secondly, there is no allegation levelled against the petitioners that proceeds of crime had been derived or obtained prior to the allocation. Furthermore, if the Court were to even scrutinize acquisitions made after allocation and tread down that path, it faces the undisputed specter of the first chargesheet having been quashed.

                        "content": "On an overall consideration of the issues delineated above, the Court comes to record the following conclusions: - A.  When the offense of money laundering is described as a stand-alone offense, all that is sought to be conveyed is that it represents an independent offense and is to be tried separately in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Act. The objective of the Act is to try charges of money laundering which entails proceeds of crime being acquired, possessed or used and/or projected as untainted property. Undisputedly, the offense of money laundering rests on the commission of a predicate offense which in turn may have resulted in a pecuniary benefit being obtained and derived. It fundamentally aims at confiscation of benefits that may be derived as a result of criminal activity and the commission of a scheduled offense. It is aimed at countering and penalising the malaise of wealth and assets acquired as a result of criminal activity  B.  It is evident from a reading of the Act that while the commission of a predicate offense is the precipitate step for initiation of proceedings under the Act, the offense of money laundering must be tried and established separately. It is also pertinent to observe that the predicate offense constitutes the very foundation of a charge of money laundering. The entire edifice of a charge of money laundering is raised on an allegation of a predicate offense having been committed, proceeds of crime generated from such activity and a projection of the tainted property as having been legitimately acquired.  C.  However, once it is found on merits that the accused had not indulged in any criminal activity, the property cannot legally be treated as proceeds  of crime or be viewed as property derived or obtained from criminal activity. Since the offense of money laundering is itself premised and founded upon the commission of a crime created under an independent statute, it cannot possibly survive or subsist once the predicate offense is found to be not established and a declaration so made by a competent court.  D.  The description of the offense of money laundering as a stand-alone offense would not in itself infuse jurisdiction in proceedings that may be initiated under the Act even after a competent court has come to hold that no criminal offense stands committed or in situations where the accused is discharged of the offense or proceedings quashed.  E.  The allegation of money laundering is premised and dependent upon the commission of a criminal offence. Unless proceeds are found to have been derived or obtained from criminal activity, the question of money laundering would not arise. The Act is concerned with the commission of an offence which may have yielded revenues of profits which are then concealed and their source obfuscated. However, once the charge of commission of a scheduled offence itself comes to be annulled by virtue of a judicial declaration with a competent Court finding that an offence could not be set to have been committed it would be impermissible to assert that a person or entity has indulged in money laundering.  F.  Since the offence of money laundering is essentially aimed at depriving persons of the fruits and benefits that may have been derived or obtained  from criminal activity, the charge is inextricably linked to criminal activity. However, once it is found that a criminal offence does not stand evidenced, the question of any property being derived or obtained therefrom or its confiscation or attachment would not arise at all and in any case, proceedings if initiated under the Act would be wholly without jurisdiction or authority.  G.  The Court finds that the expression ―proceeds of crime‖ creates an inextricable link between criminal activity and the acquisition of property and assets as a result thereof. If the charge of criminal activity ceases to exist in law, a charge of money laundering would neither sustain nor survive. The Court thus reiterates the conclusions as drawn and recorded in Rajeev Chanana and Gagandeep Singh. Consequently it must be held that once it is found by a competent court, authority or tribunal that a predicate offence is either not evidenced or on facts it is held that no offence at all was committed, proceedings under the Act would necessarily have to fall or be brought to a close.  H.  Turning then to Section 3 of the Act, the Court finds that the said provision would come into play only if proceeds of crime are found to have been generated. As this Court reads Section 3 it finds that the offence of money laundering has an enduring and ineffaceable link to proceeds of crime. Absent the commission of a criminal offence, the foundation of proceedings initiated under the Act would undoubtedly fall and self-destruct.  I.  The Court further notes that not every criminal activity falls within the ambit of Section 3. While criminal activity may represent or evidence the commission of a predicate offence under the Penal Code, it is only activity relating to the laundering of proceeds of crime which can form the subject matter of proceedings under the Act. Absent the existence of criminal activity which may have resulted in proceeds of crime having been gained or obtained, a charge under Section 3 would not sustained.  J.  The Court also bears in mind the language of Section 3 of the Act which links the activities and processes of money laundering to proceeds of crime. Section 3 creates an indelible link between property derived or obtained and criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is only when it is found that a person has derived property as a result of criminal activity that the offence of money laundering can be said to have been committed. Absent the element of criminal activity, the provisions of the Act itself would not be attracted.  K.  On a fundamental plane, Article 20(1) raises a constitutional injunction or bar in respect of penal action against a person for an act which was not an offense at the relevant time. It is to this extent that the provisions of penal statutes are constitutionally barred from operating retrospectively. The guiding expressions of Article 20(1) are “violation of a law in force” and “at the time of the commission of the act charged….”. The Constitution thus constructs a negative command against penal action and conviction except for an offense created by a law which was in force at the time of commission of the act.  L.  However, an equally well settled principle relating to the retroactive application of penal provisions is that merely because a requisite or facet for initiation of action pertains to a period prior to the enforcement of the statute, that would not be sufficient to characterize the statute as being retrospective.  M.  It must be borne in mind that the Act with which we are concerned, penalises acts of money laundering. It does not create a separate punishment for a crime chronicled or prescribed under the Penal Code. The Act does not penalise the predicate offense. That offense merely constitutes the substratum for a charge of money laundering being raised. Accordingly, while the commission of the predicate offense may be described as the sine qua non for an allegation of money laundering being laid against a person, it is an offense created independently owing its genesis to the Act which came to be promulgated on 01 July 2005. While the commission of a predicate offense may be a condition precedent for an allegation of money laundering being laid, it is the activities of money laundering alone which would determine the validity of proceedings initiated under the Act.  N.  The Court thus concludes that an offense of money laundering that may be committed post 01 July 2005 would still be subject to the rigours of the Act notwithstanding the predicate offense having been committed prior to that date. As noted hereinabove, Section 3 creates an offense for money laundering. Neither that provision nor the Act is concerned with the trial of the predicate offense. Thus, any activity or process that may  be undertaken by a person post 01 July 2005 in terms of which proceeds of crime are acquired, possessed or used and/or projected as untainted property would still be subject to the provisions of the Act.  O.  The Court exposits and reiterates the legal position to be that it is the date of the commission of the offense of money laundering and not the date of commission of a scheduled offense which is relevant and determinative. The date of inclusion of a crime as a scheduled offense would also not be determinative and the issue would have to be decided bearing in mind whether an allegation of money laundering stood committed after the Act had come into force.  P.  The conflict between Axis Bank and Seema Garg arises in the backdrop of the latter holding that the expression ―value of any other property‖ would not empower the Directorate to proceed against properties which may have no direct or indirect link with the proceeds of crime. Both the aforenoted decisions have admittedly taken into consideration that Section 2(1)(u) comprises of 3 limbs. Axis Bank takes into consideration a situation where a property which may be said to have a direct or indirect link to proceeds to crime is untraceable. It is in that backdrop that it held that in such a situation, property equivalent in value may also be attached.  Q.  The Court has found that the expression ―value of any such property‖ existed from the inception of the Act itself and this aspect must, therefore, be accorded due consideration. The concept of equivalent  value came to be included in Section 2(1)(u) only subsequently and to deal with exigencies where proceeds of crime had been ferreted out of the country and were held overseas. There was and even today does exist a substantive distinction between the use of the expressions ―value of any such property‖ and ―property equivalent in value‖ as employed in Section 2(1)(u).  R.  The third limb of Section 2(1)(u) which deals with property equivalent in value was always connected with an exigency where property is taken or held outside the country. If the principle enunciated in Seema Garg were to be followed, it would clearly amount to reading Section 2(1)(u) absent the expression ―value of any such property‖. That would not only violate the well settled tenets of statutory construction but would clearly amount to the Court re-writing the provision itself in a manner that it stands deprived of vital and purposive content.  S.  The Court while reiterating the principles laid down in Axis Bank also takes into consideration the nature of the malaise or mischief against which the Act purports to operate. It consequently finds no justification to read Section 2(1)(u) in a manner which may whittle down its apparent legislative intent and the extent of the power which it seeks to confer on the Directorate.  T.  Axis Bank also culled out various salutary and significant safeguards insofar as third-party interests, secured or unsecured, that may come to exist in property and thus balancing competing interests. Those  safeguards clearly confer protection on a bona fide third-party interest that may come to exist in property acquired upon payment of due consideration. It also recognized the right of such a person to establish before the Adjudicating Authority that the acquisition of the interest was not intended to defeat the objectives of the Act and was a transfer validly made upon payment of due consideration.  U.  Axis Bank further held that in order to uphold action that the Directorate may take against alternative attachable property was one which established a nexus or link between such properties on the one hand and the person accused of money laundering. It further propounded the test that in such a case it would have to be found that the person accused of money laundering had an interest in such property at least till the time of engagement in the proscribed criminal activity from which a pecuniary interest had been derived or obtained. It also held that the date or period of commission of criminal activity would be liable to be treated and recognized as the cut off.  V.  These tests as spelt out in Axis Bank adequately safeguard third party interests. Seema Garg while proceeding to hold to the contrary appears to have brushed aside and downplay the imperative of a fair balance being struck and thus ignoring the need and criticality of empowering the Directorate to proceed against other properties in a situation where tainted property is untraceable. For the reasons recorded in the body of this judgment, the Court finds itself unable to agree with the reasoning  assigned in Seema Garg. The principles articulated in Axis Bank are reiterated.  W.  An allocation of coal cannot possibly be viewed as amounting to proceeds of crime per se. That document at best enabled the holder thereof to obtain a mining lease. Viewed in that backdrop it cannot be said that the allocation of coal is property as contemplated under the Act. It is pertinent to note that the Act essentially seeks to confiscate properties and assets that may be derived or obtained from criminal activity and which may then be concealed. It is thus evident that it is only gains that may have been obtained by the utilization of the allocation which could have possibly been viewed as proceeds of crime.  X.  It is the gains that may be obtained from criminal activity which are concealed or projected to be untainted that can form the subject matter of the offense under the Act. The allocation of a coal block in itself did not give rise to any monetary gains. It was only when the same was utilized that the question of illegal gains would have arisen.  Y.  The impugned proceedings rest on the second chargesheet which bids us to restrict scrutiny upto 04 September 2003 when the allocation came to be made. The proceedings under the Act thus cannot travel beyond the gamut of that chargesheet. The allegations of money laundering would thus have to be cabined and fenced in upto that date. This since the offense is stated to have been committed and completed on 04 September 2003. Thus, any event or offense that may have been  allegedly committed post that date would clearly fall beyond the pale of scrutiny for the purposes of adjudging the validity of the impugned proceedings.  Z.  This aspect represents a critical pinion in this case since the criminal activity on which the allegation of money laundering is constructed and raised is the allocation of the coal block. As noted above, there is no allegation that any illegal monetary gains were derived or obtained as on 04 September 2003. This coupled with the fact that the allocation itself would not represent proceeds of crime leads the Court to the unescapable conclusion that the impugned proceedings are rendered patently illegal.  AA. The Court has additionally taken into consideration the fact that the first chargesheet and which dealt with allegations of the allocation having been utilized for the purposes of extracting coal, the diversion of the mined mineral for unlawful gain, the acquisition of properties from the profits so earned and other related allegations already stands quashed. As long as that judicial declaration holds the field, the Court would have to necessarily acknowledge that no criminal activity was indulged in.  BB. The show cause notice and the provisional orders of attachment proceed on the basis that the profits derived from criminal activities post 04 September 2003 and the properties acquired directly as a result thereof are liable to be attached under the Act. However, and as this Court has found activities post 04 September 2003, cannot form the  foundation for the initiation of proceedings under the Act since the chargesheet itself stands restricted to events which occurred up to the date of allocation only. Since for reasons recorded in the body of the judgment, it has already found that the allocation would not constitute proceeds of crime and that in light of the decision of the Court of 05 September 2014, it cannot be said that the petitioner indulged in any criminal activity, the attachment is rendered unsustainable.  CC. The argument based on possession of property and the right of the Directorate to consequently attach the same is clearly rendered unsustainable when viewed in light of the fact that those properties are not treated as untainted or permissibly attachable property constituting property equivalent in value to any such tainted properties. The allegations in the show cause notice are that these properties constitute proceeds of crime in themselves and are thus tainted property. As has been found in the judgment since the chargesheet bids us to restrict scrutiny of events only up to 04 September 2003, the impugned action could have been sustained if it had been found that proceeds of crime had been derived upto that date. That is clearly not the allegation leveled. Insofar as acquisitions made post that date and the coming into force of the Act is concerned, it is faced with the specter of the first chargesheet having already been quashed. The judgment of the Court quashing those proceedings compels and constrains the Court to acknowledge that no criminal activity was indulged in. Viewed from that perspective also, the Court comes to the conclusion that the submissions advanced by the  respondents based on the aspect of continued possession is also liable to negatived.",
