However, the Opponent had failed to prove any such technical error in the affidavit. The Opponent cannot also object to filing of the affidavit, as the Opponent itself filed additional documents in January, 2020 and the affidavits were filed in response to those additional documents. The objective of the pre-grant oppositions is to aid in examination of the application; therefore, cross examination of experts is not routine in proceedings of such nature. The Asst. Controller emphasized the need to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and preventing the abuse of Section 25(1) of the Act. Thus, the application for cross examination filed by the Opponent was refused. This order is under challenge in this writ petition.",

Counsel appearing for the Opponent challenges the order and the procedure being followed by the Patent Office on several grounds - i.  That the Patent Office ought to have first given a ruling as to whether the amendments filed by the Applicant were allowed and if allowed, which is the final set of claims being considered for grant.  ii.  Upon this decision being made, the pre-grant opponent ought to be awarded a proper hearing in respect of the claims which are finally being considered by the Patent Office.  iii.  Cross examination ought to have been permitted as the affidavits were filed by the Applicant several years after pleadings were completed by the parties and no leave was taken  for the same. There are grounds which need to be confronted to the witness.  iv.  One of the decisions Onyx Therapeutics Inc. & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. MANU/DE/4664/2019 referred to in the impugned order is an overruled decision.  v.  No proper procedure is being followed by the Patent Office in pre-grant oppositions. Amendments are being entertained parallelly and pre-grant opponents are not given adequate opportunity to challenge the amended claims.  vi.  The amendments sought to be made by the Applicant are beyond what is permissible under Section 57 and 59 of the Act. The final set of amended claims seek to add crystalline and amorphous forms of the compound which were withdrawn in Claim Set 3 filed on 30th May, 2016.",

The patent application of the Applicant, which was filed way back in 2007, is not being allowed to proceed further due to the repeated hinderances and obstacles being caused by pre-grant oppositions.  ii.  Pre-grant oppositions are being filed and entertained by the Patent Office in an indiscriminate manner even several years after the publication under Section 11A of the Act.  iii.  Due to the delays on part of the Patent Office in adjudicating of the pre-grant oppositions, more pre grant oppositions are being  filed by various parties without any proper system being followed.  iv.  The final set of amended claims which are on record are all claims which are included in Claim Set 3 consisting of claim 1 to 17 which has been supplied to the Opponent. Thus, the Opponent has had the opportunity to oppose all the claims as they currently stand with the final amendment.  v.  Cross-examination cannot be claimed as a matter of right by the Opponent as it would unduly delay the examination and decision on the Applicant’s patent application.  vi.  Even if the patent is granted today, the term of the patent expires in 2026 and only four years of the life of the patent is remaining.",

The chronology of events, in the present writ, clearly shows that the proceedings in the patent application and the pre-grant opposition have been delayed substantially. Blame for the delay cannot be attributed to any one factor or reason, but in the opinion of this Court both parties are to blame. On the one hand, the applicant continues to amend its claims from time to time over a period of five years between 2016 to 2021. On the other hand, the patent application has been exposed to multiple oppositions by several parties due to delay in the examination process. In the opinion of this Court, there ought to be a systematic manner in which proceedings in pre-grant oppositions are conducted. Repeated filing of pre-grant oppositions due to non-existence of any time limits for filing a pre grant opposition and delay in adjudication of  one pre-grant opposition, usually results in further pre-grant oppositions being filed leading to further delays in grant of patent. The patent application has the chance of being caught up in the swirl of pre-grant oppositions by Opponents. Amendments by the Applicant who gets wiser with each objection being taken, leads to further delays.",

                        "content": "In the first instance a distinction has to be drawn between a pre-grant opposition and a post-grant opposition. While a pre-grant opposition can be filed under Section 25 (1) of the Patents Act at any time after the publication of the patent application but before the grant of a patent, a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) of the Patents Act has to be filed before the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the grant of patent. A second significant difference, after the amendment of 2005, is that a pre-grant opposition can be filed by ‘any person’ whereas a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) can be filed only by ‘any person interested’. It may be noticed that the application for revocation of a patent in terms of Section 64 of the Patents Act can also to be filed only by ‘any person interested’. In other words, the post-grant opposition and the application for revocation cannot be filed by just about any person who is not shown to be a person who is ‘interested’. A third significant difference is that the representation at the stage of pre-grant is considered by the Controller himself. Rule 55 of the Patents Rules requires the Controller to consider the ‘statement and evidence  filed by the applicant’ and thereafter either refuse to grant the patent or require the complete specification to be amended to his satisfaction. Of course, in that event notice will be given to the applicant for grant of patent who can file his reply and evidence. This Court finds merit in the contention that the pre-grant opposition is in fact ‘in aid of the examination’ of the patent application by the Controller. The procedure is however different aspect as far as the post-grant opposition is concerned. There in terms of Section 25 (3), the Controller has to constitute an Opposition Board consisting of such officers as he may determine and refer to such Opposition Board the notice of opposition along with other documents for its examination and recommendations. After receiving the recommendations of the Opposition Board, the Controller gives the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard. The Controller then takes a decision to maintain, amend or revoke the patent. The fourth major difference between the pre-grant and the post-grant opposition is that while in terms of Section 117 A an appeal to the IPAB is maintainable against the order of the Controller in a post-grant opposition under Section 25(4) of the Patents Act, an appeal has not been expressly been made available against an order made under Section 25(1) of the Patents Act.”",

A pre-grant opposition is a `representation by way of opposition’ in writing by “any person”. Whereas, Section 25(2) of the Act is a `notice of opposition’ by “any person interested”. A Representation under Section 25(1) of the Act does not strictly follow the norms laid down under the Code of Civil Procedure. However, since Rule 55(4) of the Rules contemplates filing a reply  statement and evidence, if the applicant wishes to, it can be said that the proceedings is adjudicatory as the same is adversarial in nature.",

A short and brief order should be passed in respect of the amendments which should be uploaded on the website of the Patent Office so that everyone concerned would know the decision on the amendment. In any event, if an amendment is being carried out during the pendency of a pre-grant opposition, the ruling on the amendment ought to be sent to the pre-grant opponent as well. Sometime amendments are carried out during the course of hearings across the table as well, when the patent agent of the Applicant attends the hearing before the Controller.

Be that as it may, the fact is that three substantive affidavits have been filed by the Applicant  along with an amended set of claims on 6th June, 2021. Rulings on the amendment are yet to be issued by the Patent Office. Thus, in the opinion of the Court, an opportunity ought to be granted to the Opponent to rebut the evidence of the Applicant. The Opponent-Natco has agreed to not insist on its prayer seeking cross examination of Applicant’s witnesses-Dr. Michael Motto, Dr. Allan S. Myerson and Dr. Gauri Billa, if it is given an opportunity to file affidavits of its own experts in rebuttal. The said arrangement is not objected to by the Applicant. In the above background, and in order to expedite the decision on the application and the pre-grant opposition, the following directions are issued:  i)  the Opponent is permitted to file affidavits of its own experts in rebuttal to the three expert affidavits filed by the Applicant, within a period of four weeks.  ii)  If any documents are filed by the Opponent along with the said expert affidavits, the same shall be dealt with by the Applicant by way of additional written submissions within one week thereafter, without any further documents being filed by the Applicant.  iii)  The Opponent is also permitted to file its additional written submissions within two weeks after filing of additional written submissions by the Applicant. The written submissions filed by both the parties shall be considered by the Controller for final decision in the pre-grant opposition;  iv)  Parties shall appear before the Patent Office on 12th September, 2022 at 2:30 p.m. Both the Applicant and the Opponent shall be given one hour each to make their submissions.  v)  The situation as it exists today is that there has been no ruling on any of the amendments which have been filed by the Applicant. Thus, before the commencement of oral hearing in the pre-grant opposition, the Controller shall communicate orally to both the parties as to which of the amendments are being allowed and which would be the final set of claims which is being considered for grant.  vi)  On the said date, after hearing the parties for one hour each, the final decision on the application/pre-grant opposition shall be given by the Patent Office on or before 15th November, 2022. The final decision rendered shall be communicated to all the parties and shall also be uploaded on the website of the Patent Office;  vii)  It is clarified that the hearing of any other opposition proceeding which has already concluded is not being re-opened by this Court;",

D1: WO 2004/018468 A (2004-03-04)  D2: WO 2004/050658 A (2004-06-17)  D3: WO 2005/085246 A (2005-09-15)  D4: WO 2006/029769 A (2006-03-23)  Novelty under section 2(1)(j) of Patents Act,1970.

                        "content": "After this decision was rendered, in so far as the pending divisional application was concerned, the FER was issued on 16th July, 2019. A response dated 16th January, 2020 was filed to the said FER and a pre-grant opposition dated 27th January, 2021, was also filed qua this divisional application. The reply statements, etc. were completed in the pre-grant opposition and after hearing the pre-grant opponent and the Applicant, by the impugned order dated 25th March, 2022, the divisional application was refused. The reasoning given by the Controller in the impugned decision is that the division itself could not have been permitted as the Amendments  were rejected in the parent application. Since the current Claims had been already examined and refused, the same Claims cannot be allowed in another application. The Controller also reproduced various other objections raised by the pre-grant opponent. The findings in the impugned order dated 25th March, 2022 are as under:  •c) I have analysed the amended claims of the parent application (9501/DELNP/2008) were refused under section 15 due to the reason that none compliance of section 57 and 59. As well as the parent refusal order clearly indicates the lack of Novelty and inventive step as well.  The applicant replicated amended claims of the parent application in the Divisional application (present), since, there were three set of claims was filed/amended until refusal of the parent application, the first set was original claims ( 18 claims ) and second set of claims ( 11 claims ) amended in the year 2015 in response to FER and the third set of claims (15 claims in 2016) all above three set of claims have been examined, finally an opportunity of hearing was also offered followed by written submission, based on argument and /or written submissions, the refusal order was issued in the parent application refusing all the claims. The three set of claims are distinguished as under in tabular format to make it clear understanding, and all three set of claims are reproduced above.  From the above analysis, it is observed that the claims amended at various point of time during prosecution of the parent application which are exactly similar to that of present claims pending with alleged divisional patent application.  d)  It is to be noted that the claims which are amended in the Parent application for grant of patent, at various stages that includes in response to First Examination report, in response to hearing notice and as well in post hearing written submission as well. Those claims were refused with a due process under section 15. The reason for refusal can be seen in the order of parent application, however, the applicant submitted before the hearing officer that previous amendments carried out in the claims on March 23, 2015 and February 19, 2016 are allowable. The amendments made in claims were based on original claims 10-12 and the description in the specification and are therefore allowable under Section 59(1) of Act. In this regard, the attention is invited to last paragraph page 12, which reads as 'The DPP IV inhibitors mentioned above may also be used in conjunction with other active substances, by means of which improved treatment results can be obtained Such a combined treatment may be given as a free combination of the substances or in the form of a fixed combination, for example in a tablet or capsule. Paragraph 2 of page 13 reads as Examples of antidiabetic combination partners are metformin. The last paragraph of page 20 reads 'A particular preferred example of an antidiabetic combination partner is metformin. The last paragraph of page 22 recites telmisartan as a combination partner. Further, Examples 13 and 16 of the specification relate  to combinations with metformin and telmisartan respectively.  The learned Controller's attention is further invited to the provisions under Section 59 of the Act which lays down the conditions for allowance/disallowance of amendments. Section 59 is reproduced below:  Section 59(1)-No amendment of an application for a patent or a complete specification or any document relating thereto shall be made except by way of disclaimer, correction or explanation, and no amendment thereof shall be allowed, except for the purpose of incorporation of actual fact, and no amendment of a complete specification shall be allowed, the effect of which would be that the specification as amended would claim or describe matter not in substance disclosed or shown in the specification before the amendment, or that any claim of the specification as amended would not fall wholly within the scope of a claim of the specification before the amendment. Under Section 59(1), the amendments made by the Appellant should not fall outside the scope of the unamended specification. This has also been affirmed by the Honorable Board in its order Solvay Fluor GmBH v E.l Du Pont de Nemours and Company & others (ORDER No.111 of 2010). The relevant paragraphs 18 and 19 of the order are reproduced below:",

                        "content": "The amendment must be for incorporation of actual fact; 3. The effect of amendment should not enable the specification as amended to describe any matter not in substance disclosed or shown in the specification before amendment; All the three above-identified conditions are  fulfilled by the amended claims submitted by the Applicant in the present application.  The amendments were carried out by way of correction and explanation. Further, as the medicament combinations are clearly disclosed in the specification, the amendments pertained to incorporation of actual fact. The third condition was also complied with since the amendments made by the Appellant pertain to the matter already disclosed in the specification and do not fall outside the scope of the unamended specification. In view of the above, it was requested to allow the amendments carried out on March 23, 2015 and February 19, 2016.  e)  The Applicant submits that the amended claims are novel and inventive over the cited prior art documents and do not fall under Section 3(e). In this regard, the Applicant submits the following: Beneficially, as stated in the application was filed, the DPP IV inhibitors as included in the present claim set \"are distinguished from structurally comparable DPP IV inhibitors, as they combine exceptional potency and a long-lasting effect with favourable pharmacological properties, receptor selectivity and a favourable side-effect profile or bring about unexpected therapeutic advantages or improvements when combined with other pharmaceutical active substances\" (page 11 of the description). Linagliptin (BI 1356), a particularly preferred DPP-4 inhibitor of the present application (page 7 of the description, last paragraph, first species) inhibits DPP-4 more effective and longer lasting than the other major DPP-4 inhibitors vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin, and is thus potent at low therapeutic doses and long-acting. The low dose amount is a particular feature for the provision of combinations of the present DPP IV inhibitor species according to the present claim set, constituting a contribution of the invention over the art. The low oral dose such as recited in the claims reflects said exceptional potency and long lasting effect, and is for at least this reason remarkable and valuably  enriching the art. Further, Linagliptin is characterized by unique pharmacokinetics, such as with nonlinear profile (less than dose-proportional exposures). Other gliptins have dose-proportional (fairly linear) oral pharmacokinetie properties. Accordingly, optimization for therapeutic dose of linagliptin is not necessarily trivial. Further beneficially, the combination of linagliptin and metformin was shown to be well tolerated and improved glycemic control more than either monotherapy. For example: Combination of linagliptin and metformin improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: A randomized trial with an open-label arm in patients with poor glycemic control: Progression to combination of oral glucose-lowering drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recommended when monotherapy fails to reach treatment targets. This 24-week, double-blind, placebo controlled study randomized 791 T2DM patients. The 6 treatment groups included 2 arms receiving free combinations of linagliptin 2.5 mg bid+ either low-or high-dose (500 or 1000 mg) metformin (MET) bid.  Four monotherapy arms received linagliptin 5 mg q,d, MET 500 or 1000 mg bid, or placebo. Patients with a baseline HbAIc ≥11% received open-label combination therapy with linagliptin 2.5 mg bid+ MET 1000 mg bid (n=66). Mean baseline HbA1c was between 8.5% and 8.7%, and 11.8% in the open-label arm. Placebo-corrected, adjusted mean HbAIc changes after 24 weeks are shown in the figure [figure 1]. For the combination of linagliptin 2.5 +MET 500 or 1000, the placebo corrected reduction in HbAIc was -1.3% and -1.7%, respectively. Both combination regimens were superior to the monotherapy arms. In patients with poor glycemic control, mean change in HbA1c from baseline was -3.7%. Adverse event rates were similar across treatment arms. The total number of hypoglycemic events during combination treatment was low (in total, 5 [1.8%] randomized patients receiving linagliptin 2.5 + MET 500 or 1000). The difference in body weight after treatment  with linagliptin 2.5 +MET 1000 compared with MET 1000 was -0.23 kg. The combination of linagliptin and MET was well tolerated and improved glycemic control more than either monotherapy. Combination of linagliptin with MET significantly improves glycemic control towards treatment targets without weight gain and with a very low risk of hypoglycaemia Figure 1, Therefore, e.g., a particularly suitable and beneficial/positive therapeutic combining effect and usability (e.g. significant efficacy and/or favourable safety) can be achieved by the combinations according to the present invention, thus valuably enriching the art. The above Figure 1 clearly shows the effects of linagliptin (5 qd) alone, metformin (500 bid, 1000 bid) alone, as well as the effects of various linagliptin+metforrnin combinations, particularly the considerable effect in the most right bar in Figure 1 as to the combination linagliptin+metformin in patients with poor glycemic control. The combination of linagliptin and metformin provides significant improvements in glycemic control compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to linagliptin alone. Thus, the combination therapy of linagliptin with metformin relates to a particular embodiment of the present invention. Furthermore beneficially, in type II diabetes patients who are not adequately controlled on another oral anti-hyperglycemic drug, the combination of a DPP-IV inhibitor of this invention with such other anti-hyperglycemic drug provides a therapeutic benefit to such patients. Especially, in type II diabetes patients who are not adequately controlled on metformin, the add-on combination of linagliptin (which is a DPP-IV inhibitor of this invention) to existing metformin therapy results in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control, without weight gain or increased risk of hypoglycemia; thus such combination provides indeed a \"synergistic\" (cooperative, complementary or improving) effect. One skilled in the art would not have plainly and inevitably predicted that the specific dosage amount of the DPP-IV inhibitor species in a combination  with metformin would provide the (clinically and therapeutically) significant improvements in glycemic control (AI C and FPG) as outlined above.  f)  With reference to paragraph 2 of the hearing notice the agent for the applicant submitted that the amendments previously carried out in the claims on March 23, 2015 and February 19, 2016 are not found to be persuasive as amended claims so filed goes beyond the scope of originally filed claims. It may be noted that the subject matter of originally filed claims relate to USE of DPP IV inhibitor of formula I or formula II alone (claims 1-9) or in combination with other active substances (claims 10-13), isolation or storage medium for islets of Langerhans or beta cells (claims 14-15), method of enhancing the vitality and secretion capacity of islets of Langerhans or beta cells and method of treating a patient with a DIPP IV inhibitor (claims 16-18).  The said claims were restricted to three claims relating to isolation or storage medium for islets of Langerhans or beta cells and method of enhancing the vitality and secretion capacity of islets of Langerhans or beta cells in response to FER filed on 24/10/2014. Subsequent to FER reply two form-13 filed on 23/03/2015 and 19/02/2016 for making amendment in claims.  g)  The amended claims 1-11 as filed on 23/03/2015 (are most similar to the present patent application) •relates to a medicament combination of a DIPP IV inhibitor with metformin and the amended claims as filed on 19/02/2016 ( are most similar to the present patent application) further contains 4 new claims (claims 12-15), in addition to claims as filed on 23/03/2015, which relate to a medicament combination of a DIPP IV inhibitor with telmisartan. The scope of protection of original filed claims, i.e. use of DPP IV inhibitor of formula I or formula II alone or in combination with other active substances, cannot be extended to the protection of a medicament combination of a DIPP IV  inhibitor with metformin/telmisartan as such change in contents of amended claims does not wholly fall within the scope of original filed claims. Further said amendments cannot be considered to be done by way of disclaimer, correction, clarification or explanation as there is clear change in category of claims wherein •use claims• were amended to •product claims• entirely changes in the scope. The submission given by the agent for the applicant w.r.t. section 3(e) of the Patents Act is in reference to the amended claims, relating to medicament combination, which were not allowed hence said submission is irrelevant. Further no submission filed by the agent for the applicant for the objections raised in paragraphs 2 and 3 of hearing notice, regarding lack of novelty and inventive step of claims 1-3 (as filed on 24/10/2014) w.r.t. cited prior art documents D1-D4 and claims 1-3 falling under section 3(e), 3(i) and 3(j) of the Patents Act, therefore said objections still stands. Based on the above facts and circumstances of the case, the parent application application No. 9501/DELNP/was refused for grant of patent u/s 15 of the Patents Act, 1970 as per as the parent application concerned.  h)  The above analysis made on the original claims as well as on amended claims affected in 2015 and 2016 itself. Consequently the refusal order issued on the amended claims, and the refused claims are most similar with pending claims in the alleged patent application. It is to be noted that the parent refusal order clearly stipulates the reasons that the amended claims how it goes beyond the scope of the invention under section 57 and 59, and the amended claims subsequently were not allowed.  i)  Because of non • allowance of the amended claims followed by refusal under section 15 would not be a case for divisional application. Perhaps, the amended claims could have been allowed in the parent application itself even If there was any little chance for allowance, The order also clearly indicates original and amended claims lacking Novelty and obviousness, regarding Novelty and  inventive step the Parent refusal order has already been considered and examined during prosecution of the parent application. Thus, the current claims on record absolutely do not have any merits for the purpose of divisional application. The entire specification directed for use of the compound, but nowhere in the specification relates to the medicaments. The agent of the applicant made attempts to get a patent on the amended claims in the parent application, after refusal of the parent application claims (original, amended claims in 2015, amended claims in 2016) the three set of claims are similar to the present divisional application claims. Therefore, failure to get patent on the parent application is not eligible criteria for divisional application. Very important to note that in case, if the amended claims are allowable in the present application then the same claims could have been allowed in the parent application itself if meeting all criteria.  Therefore, the objection raised in the hearing notice i.e Invention u/s 2(1)(j) 1. Objections as mentioned in this office communication letter dated on 16/07/2019 is still maintained and applicant reply to objections on 31/12/2019 have been fully considered but they are not persuasive in view of the following reasons. Applicant argument that Section 16{1} clearly and expressly allows at any time before grant to voluntarily to file a divisional application in respect of any invention disclosed in the complete specification. But Section 16{1} of the Act illustrates that an applicant can file for a further application, if the complete specification related to more than one invention. Before the grant of patent that has been already been filled for which is referred to as the first mentioned application. \"If he so desires\" is not unconditional and it does not give the applicant an unjustified liberty to file a divisional application even when there is no multiple invention in the parent application. A divisional has to satisfy the test of Section 16 of the Act which means that more than one invention  in the parent application has to be shown. 1. Claims of the parent application 9501/delnp/2008 filed on 14/11/2008 did not contain any plurality of invention u/s 10(5) of the patent act 1970. Therefore the current divisional application is invalid and the current application is not allowed u/s 16(1) of the patent act 1970. Thus novelty and inventive step of the current divisional application is not examined.  Claims 1-25 of the current divisional application were already examined and refused in the parent application, and therefore same claims cannot be allowed in another application.  The above objection exhaustively discussed during the course of hearing followed by analysis of post hearing written submission made, the findings of the case are clearly enumerated above, in view of above findings the patent application bearing no. 201718031279 divisional of a refused PCT National Phase Application No.: 9501/DELNP/2008 95 is refused under section 15.•",

The content of the specification describes the invention. The complete specification also describes the procedures, processes, methods, including the best methods. But what is crucial to note, is the fact that the invention itself is defined in the claims. While such claims do have to be based on the disclosure in the specification, however even if a person does not read the complete specification and wishes to identify the invention, the place to look for it is in the •Claims•. The Invention thus resides in the Claims. Accordingly, •unity of the invention•/ •plurality of inventions• and whether they form a •single inventive concept• has to be gleaned from a reading of the claims. This position has been examined and held so by the IPAB as well in ESCO  Corporation v. Controller of Patents & Designs [OA/66/2020/PT/DEL, decided on 27th October, 2020], where the IPAB observed:  •10. Therefore, looking at the provisions of law and the settled practices, we reach the following conclusions that a patent application can only be divided, if it claims more than •one invention•. Now the question therefore is how •one invention• is defined. We look at the provisions of •unity of invention• as provided in section 10(5) of the Patents Act, 1970. It says •The claim or claims of a complete specification shall relate to a single invention, or to a group of inventions linked so as to form a single inventive concept•. Means if any specification claims either a single invention or a group of invention linked so as to form a single inventive concept, the requirement of •unity of invention• is satisfied.

Therefore, under Section 16, the question of whether the claims of the complete specification relate to more than invention i.e., a •plurality of inventions• has to be seen from the claims of the parent application. Obviously, the claims in turn, have to be based on the disclosure in the specification. However, if the invention is not contained in the claims of the parent application, the divisional application cannot be permitted to be filed  solely on the basis of disclosure made in the specification, in respect of alleged inventions. If applicants are permitted to file such divisional applications on the basis of disclosure in the complete specification, without such inventions being claimed in parent applications, it would defeat the fundamental rule of patent law i.e., •what is not claim is disclaimed•. 1 Similarly, Section 59 also makes it clear that amendments beyond the scope of the specification and claims would not be permissible. This is the settled legal position, as also held by this Court in Nippon A&L Inc. v. The Controller of Patents [C.A. (COMM.IMPD-PAT) 11/2022, decided on 5th July, 2022]. Thus, the divisional application would be maintainable only when the claims of the parent application disclose •plurality of inventions•. 32. This position of law is also borne out by various decisions of the IPAB. For instance, most recently in ESCO (supra), the IPAB held as under:  •10. Therefore, looking at the provisions of law and the settled practices, we reach the following conclusions that a patent application can only be divided, if it claims more than •one invention•. Now the question therefore is how •one invention• is defined. We look at the provisions of •unity of invention• as provided in section 10(5) of the Patents Act, 1970.

Section 16 pertains to power of the Respondent to make order respecting division of application.

It was submitted that the Supreme Court in the said judgment has held that even if an invention satisfies the criteria of Novelty and Inventive step, patent can be denied on the ground of Section 3(d). Provisions of Section 3(d) exclude the patentability of a new form of a known substance if it does not result in enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance. Respondent No. 2 claimed a form (suspo-emulsion) of the admixture/combination of Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron and therefore, the applicant had to pass the test of both Section 3(d) and 3(e), though on different aspects, i.e., enhanced efficacy over known combination of a suspo-emulsion for the former and synergistic effect over the mere additive effect of individual components of the suspo-emulsion composition for the latter. Therefore, it is not right for the Respondents to take a stand that the reasoning given qua bio-efficacy and stability of the subject matter deals with both Section 3(d) and 3(e) and Respondent No. 1 was not separately required to consider the opposition under Section 3(d).",

It is not permissible to substitute reasons at this stage by the Respondents, to justify and defend the impugned order, when there is no such finding supported by reasons in the impugned order.

Case of Petitioner was that Respondent No. 2’s claim to a SE composition containing a known combination of two agrochemical compounds with excipients is not patentable under Section 3(d). Petitioner admits that patent was sought in respect of a composition. A composition or an admixture falls entirely in the scope of examination under Section 3(e) and Section 3(d) would have no relevance in the present case. Reading of the provisions show that the moment the Petitioner refers to known substances being mixed together, the same automatically entails an examination under Section 3(e) and not under Section 3(d). Section 3(e) presupposes that the composition/admixture is of two or more known substances and therefore, what needs to be examined is whether the same exhibits a synergistic effect, which is not a mere aggregation of the properties or effects of two or more substances. Court would have to apply the ‘pith and substance’ test in respect of admixtures/ combinations and if so applied, only Section 3(e) is applicable.",

There cannot be a debate that the Act provides a remedy of post-grant opposition or a revocation petition to a ‘person interested’, who is unsuccessful in a pre-grant opposition as well as an appeal thereafter under Section 117A of the Act. Nonetheless, in my considered view, if the Petitioner is able to substantiate the pleas that Respondent No. 1 has committed a manifest error leading to violation of  principles of natural justice or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it or there is non-consideration of vital grounds or documents, Petitioner cannot be non-suited in the present petition. In order to come to this conclusion, this Court draws strength from the judicial expositions on the rule of alternative remedy and self-restraint. In Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others, (1998) 8 SCC 1, the Supreme Court has elaborately and perspicuously explained the scope and ambit of judicial interference in a writ jurisdiction even where an alternative remedy is available to a party. It was observed in the said case that under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, High Court has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition, but the High Court may impose upon itself certain restrictions, one of which is the existence of an effective and efficacious remedy available to a party, in which case the High Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. However, in three contingencies the alternative remedy does not operate as a bar and one of them, as enunciated by the Supreme Court, was where there is violation of principles of natural justice. Relevant paras of the judgment are as under:- “14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution but also for “any other purpose”.",

But the alternative remedy has been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.

Seen in this light, at the cost of repetition, it be noted that Petitioner has alleged violation of principles of natural justice on many-fold grounds inter alia: (a) non-consideration of pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1)(f) read with Section 3(d) of the Act; (b) non-consideration of crucial and relevant documents placed on record by the Petitioner, including prior art references; (c) taking into account Respondent No. 2’s additional documents and  evidence without informing the Petitioner of the filing of the said documents/evidence; and (d) taking into account the amended claims on 06.04.2022, i.e. two days prior to the impugned order, without notifying the Petitioner of such amendments and seeking its response.

The proposition is no doubt a binding dictum, however, in the present case, this Court is not reappreciating any finding of fact as an Appellate Authority and the judgment cannot help Respondent No.1. The contentions raised by the Petitioner are violation of principles of natural justice and non-consideration of grounds raised and documents filed and it is settled that these are the exceptions in which a writ jurisdiction can be exercised by a High Court. Similarly, in Sh. Satish Chand Kapoor (supra), this Court held that in a writ jurisdiction, the Court cannot act as an Appellate Court reappreciating the orders of the Tribunals or statutory authorities. Respondent No.1 has failed to note that in the same very judgment, the Court has held that the High Court may interfere in the final order passed by the statutory authority if the order suffers from manifest error and if allowed to stand, it would amount to  perpetuation of grave injustice.

In case Petitioner is able to establish the pleas raised, the impugned order becomes unsustainable in law, it would be unfair to relegate the Petitioner to the long-drawn remedy of a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) or an application for revocation under Section 64 of the Act. In this context, I am persuaded by the observations of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Glochem Industries (supra), relevant paras of which are profitably reproduced as follows:- “11. The Respondent No. 1 on the other hand, have supported the impugned decision on the argument that all relevant matters have been taken into account by the Respondent No. 4 while answering the controversy on hand. It is not a case of any manifest error committed by the Respondent No. 4. Further, this Court cannot sit in appeal over the opinion of the Respondent No. 4 on technical issues. It is submitted that Petitioners had fair opportunity in pursuing their objections and the Respondent No. 4 has dealt with the objection as raised by the Petitioners and decided the same on merits. According to Respondent No. 1, there is an alternative and efficacious remedy available to the Petitioners to which they can take recourse to. It is submitted that the remedy of post grant opposition under Section 25(2) of the Act is still available. Even remedy of seeking suo moto revocation of Patent under Section 64 of the Act can be resorted to. Moreover, it is also open to the  Petitioners to file a counter claim for revocation or invalidation of Patent, in a suit which may be filed by the Patentee, under Section 104 of the Act. Even for that reason, the Court should be slow in entertaining the present writ petition.",

Although the Petitioners may have remedy of post grant opposition or of seeking suo moto revocation as well as filing of a counter claim as is suggested by the Respondents that by itself can be no basis to non-suit the Petitioners, if the Petitioners were right in their grievance that the authority has committed manifest or jurisdictional error while considering the representation by way of opposition or for that matter decided the objections on palpable misreading and misapplication of the relevant provisions of law. This is so because the law provides for remedy of pre-grant opposition by virtue of Section 25(1) of the Act. If such a remedy is provided, the authority is obliged to consider the representation by way of pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1) keeping in mind the parameters of law by observing principles of natural justice. It is not necessary for us to examine the argument of the Petitioners that the remedy of pre-grant opposition is qualitatively different than the remedy of post-grant opposition. According to the Petitioners, in the pre-grant opposition, the onus is on the patent applicant to show that the alleged invention would result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance; whereas in the post-grant opposition, the onus will be on the objector to show that the alleged invention does not result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance. Suffice it to observe that the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent No. 1 does not mean that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the decision of the authority on the opposition under Section 25(1) of the Act. It is a matter of prudence and discretion as to whether the Court should entertain the writ petition or not.

Union of India & Anr., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 7014, wherein the Court held that if there is breach of principles of natural justice, then notwithstanding the alternative remedy by way of appeal the Court would have jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition. The fact that an aggrieved party has an adequate remedy in law, which in a given case may persuade the Court not to intervene in the matter and relegate the party to the remedy available under the Statute, is a rule of policy, convenience and/or discretion rather than a rule of law. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in ABL International Ltd. and Anr. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and Ors., (2004) 3 SCC 553. Finding on the facts of the case that there were violations of principles of natural justice as well as the procedure adopted by Controller of Patents, the Court set aside the impugned order whereby grant of patent was rejected and remanded the matter for a fresh decision. In Agriboard International (supra) the Court found that without the required analysis in accordance with the provisions of the Act, rejection of the patent application was wrong as also that the impugned order was unreasoned and non-speaking and accordingly remanded the matter back to the Competent Authority for a fresh consideration, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Manohar v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. AIR 2013 SC 681, wherein the Supreme Court has observed that application of mind and recording of reasons in a decision are the basic elements of natural justice and scrupulous adherence to these principles would be required while rejecting patent applications.

Assistant  Controller of Patents and Designs and Anr. in W.P.(C) IPD 3/2022, the Court in a challenge to an order rejecting the pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1) of the Act, remanded the matter back to the Authority for reconsidering the matter and passing a reasoned order, finding that the impugned order was bereft of any reason and was a non-speaking order and thus in violation of well-established principles of natural justice.",

Adverting to the impugned order, it is palpably clear that Respondent No. 1 has not even taken note of Section 3(d) in the entire order and consequently not dealt with the submissions made in respect thereof.

The claims of the impugned application relate to a suspo-emulsion formulation comprising a combination of known substances i.e., Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron with inactive excipients and therefore must fulfil the requirements of Section 3(d). The Opponent submits that claims of the impugned application relate to a suspo-emulsion formulation comprising a combination of known substances i.e., Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron with inactive excipients. However, from the prior art documents cited herein, the formulation/ composition of the impugned application is already known. Moreover, the applicant has not provided any technical data and/or experimental proof of any enhancement in the significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy i.e., no experimental data has bene provided by the applicant to prove the alleged efficacious nature of the SE formulation/composition claimed by the applicant in the impugned application. The data provided in the specification of the impugned patent application only provides the average number of whiteflies after treatment with claimed formulation and the % leaf infection by Liriomyza Trifolii on Tomato Leaf miner, which does not indicate any enhancement of efficacy of the claimed formulation as no mortality rate has been provided by the applicant. Additionally, no comparison has been made by the applicant w.r.t the claimed formulation with any prior art SE formulation. Failing this, no efficacy can be claimed by the applicant in respect of the claimed formulation of the impugned application.  c)  Therefore, the Applicant’s claim to a SE composition containing a known combination of two agrochemical compounds with excipients is not patentable under Section 3(d) of The Patents Act.”",

We are clearly of the view that the importance of the amendment made in Section 3(d), that is, the addition of the opening words in the substantive provision and the insertion of the Explanation to the substantive provision, cannot be underestimated. It is seen above that, in course of the Parliamentary debates, the amendment in Section 3(d) was the only provision cited by the Government to allay the fears of the Opposition members concerning the abuses to which a product patent in medicines may be vulnerable. We have, therefore, no doubt that the amendment/addition made in Section 3(d) is  meant especially to deal with chemical substances, and more particularly pharmaceutical products. The amended portion of Section 3(d) clearly sets up a second tier of qualifying standards for chemical substances/pharmaceutical products in order to leave the door open for true and genuine inventions but, at the same time, to check any attempt at repetitive patenting or extension of the patent term on spurious grounds.",

In that case, on reading clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) with Section 3(d) it would appear that the Act sets different standards for qualifying as “inventions” things belonging to different classes, and for medicines and drugs and other chemical substances, the Act sets the invention threshold further higher, by virtue of the amendments made in Section 3(d) in the year 2005.”  (emphasis supplied)",

As noted by the Supreme Court, the Parliamentary debate focused on agricultural chemicals as well.

The applicant has provided data regarding the reduced toxicity of composition which is in the form of suspo-emlsuion in comparison to toxicity exhibited by individual components of the composition. From the submissions given by the applicant, it was observed that it is not a mere admixture of Pyriproxyfen, Diafenthiuron, Poly Aryl Phenol/Octyl Phenol Ethoxylates, Magnesium Aluminium Silicate and Acrylic polymer but a synergistic suspo-emulsion as prepared by method claimed in claim 10.  Hence subject matter of claims 1-10 does not fall under Section 3(e) of The Patents Act, 1970.”",

Explanation.—For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy;  (e)  a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of the properties of the components thereof or a process for producing such substance;”",

                        "content": "Both Section 3(d) and 3(e) fall under Chapter II of the Act. Section 3(d) provides that a mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in enhanced efficacy of that substance shall not be an invention. Explanation to the Section provides that ‘combinations’ shall be considered to be the same substance unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy. Section 3(e) provides that a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof shall not be an invention. Plain reading of the two provisions, indicates that Section 3(d) entails an assessment of ‘enhanced  efficacy’ of the claimed composition in comparison to the efficacy of the known substance while the assessment under Section 3(e) is with a view to determine the synergistic effect of claimed composition with the individual properties of each component comprising the composition. Legislature in its wisdom has enacted two different provisions and the tests for both are different. The Supreme Court in Novartis (supra) has observed that Section 3(d) is not ex majore cautela and sets up a second tier of qualifying standards in chemical substances/pharmaceutical products to encourage genuine inventions, at the same time keeping check on evergreening. Section 3(d) provides a safeguard to patentability of a new form of known substance if it does not pass the threshold of enhanced efficacy. Thus, the Respondents may not be wholly correct in arguing that an adjudication under Section 3(e) of novelty or a product not being a mere admixture would cover the adjudication under Section 3(d). There is merit in the contention of the Petitioner that the patent applicant has claimed a suspo-emulsion of admixture/combination of Diafenthiuron and Pyriproxyfen and therefore, the applicant would have to pass the test under both Section 3(d) and 3(e), albeit on different aspects by showing enhanced efficacy over known combination of a suspo-emulsion qua Section 3(d) and synergistic effect over the mere additive effect of individual components of suspo-emulsion composition. Therefore, it was incumbent upon Respondent No. 1 to take note of the pre-grant opposition under Section 3(d) and deal with the same, in accordance with law and the material placed on record.",

However, if bio-efficacy/stability is to be tested in respect of Section 3(d), the test would be bio-efficacy/stability of the form, i.e., suspo-emulsion in this case and not the admixture, over and above the closest prior art brought forth by the opposer, which is the known substance as a comparator. Petitioner has also raised a plea that the data provided by Respondent No. 2 related to bio-efficacy/stability and not with respect to enhanced efficacy as compared to the prior art, i.e., the alleged known substance. Therefore, once the Petitioner had raised opposition under Section 3(d) and 3(e) both, Respondent No. 1 was required to deal with the opposition, looking at the scheme of the Act and the intent of the legislature in enacting two separate provisions.",

Had the objection been rejected on merit, Petitioner would have taken recourse to further remedies under the Act. Petitioner is right in its argument that all these reasonings are being provided by the Respondents in their reply before this Court while none of this finds mention in the impugned order.

No  reason is discernible from the impugned order as to why the documents were not considered by Respondent No. 1 and to this extent, as rightly contended by the Petitioner, the impugned order is non-speaking and unreasoned.

Patents Act is a complete Code which provides a mechanism and a procedure for carrying out amendment of an application, specifications, etc., before the Deputy Controller of Patents under  Sections 57 and 59 thereof. Admittedly, the procedure, as mandated under the Act, was not followed by Respondent No. 1 before permitting Respondent No. 2 to carry out the amendment. In fact, the amendment was allowed two days prior to the passing of the impugned order, without even notifying the Petitioner of the same, leave alone giving an opportunity to respond. Assuming that the amendment was trivial or insignificant in the perception of the Respondents, which is the case being set up at this stage, it may not have been so for the Petitioner and given an opportunity it may have been able to justify the opposition. It is pertinent to note that strangely and significantly the order impugned herein does not even mention that an amendment was made to the original claims and specifications by Respondent No. 2, which were allowed.",

The relevant paragraph reads as under:  “9. The increasing institution of cases in all Courts in India and its resultant burden upon the Courts has invited attention of all concerned in the justice administration system. Despite heavy quantum of cases in Courts, in our view, it would neither be permissible nor possible to state as a principle of law, that while exercising power of judicial review on administrative action and more particularly judgment of courts in appeal before the higher Court, providing of reasons can never be dispensed with. The doctrine of audi alteram partem has three basic essentials. Firstly, a person against whom an order is required to be passed or whose rights are likely to be affected adversely must be granted an opportunity of being heard. Secondly, the concerned authority should provide a fair and transparent procedure and lastly, the authority concerned must apply its mind and dispose of the matter by a reasoned or speaking order.

The said affidavit stated that the proceedings on 26th February, 2020 were handwritten and counter signed by advocates for both parties. The said affidavit also stated that the impugned order was uploaded on 11th June, 2020. On the next date before the Court, i.e., 6th October, 2020, after perusing the affidavit filed on behalf of Respondent No.1, it was found that the same was not satisfactory and, further directions were issued  to Respondent No.1 to answer specifically the following questions:  •9. It is noticed that even as on today, the evidence purported to have been filed under Rule 45/Rule 47 by the Respondent/Opponent is not available online on the TMR•s website. This Court is of the opinion that the affidavit of the Registrar of Trade Marks is clearly not in compliance with the order passed by this Court on 10th June, 2020. It is the duty of the Registrar of Trade Marks to comply with the order both in letter and in spirit. The dates on which the exact evidence was filed by the opponent had to be clarified in the affidavit, which the affidavit clearly does not. Under these circumstances, it is deemed appropriate to direct that the affidavit shall be filed by Shri. Hoshiar Singh, the Head of Trademark Registry, Delhi office, after enquiring into the matter fully, within a period of two weeks giving the following specific details:  a)  Whether any documents were uploaded on behalf of the Opponent in all four oppositions under Rule 45, and if so on which date and how many pages were there?  b)  Whether any documents were uploaded on behalf of the Opponent under Rule 47 in all four oppositions, and if so on which date and how many pages were there?  c)  Whether the evidence by way of affidavit of Mrs. Kalpana Umakanth running into 12 pages in all the four opposition proceedings was uploaded online on 5th August, 2019 or not and if so what is the proof thereof?  d)  Reason, if any, as to why the Certificate issued by Mr. Chandrakant S. Uchil, Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks & GI, Mumbai working as System Administrator describes the number of pages uploaded on 5th August, 2019 as being one page each and not the 12 pages which are annexed with the said Certificate.  e)  The provision of law under which purported  online filing on 5th August, 2019 has been considered by the Trade Marks Registry.•",

                        "content": "On the one hand, the stand of the Applicant is that there is a clear doubt as to whether the evidence was filed within time. Mr. Siddhant Goel, ld. Counsel for the Applicant submits that the evidence was not even served upon the Applicant. To support this contention, he makes the following  submissions:  (i)  Section 21(4) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter •Trademarks Act•) specifically provides that the evidence has to be filed in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time. The same should be read along with Rule 45 (1) of the TM Rules, to interpret the prescribed manner and time as 2 months, with service to the Applicant and Registry.  (ii)  Since the period for filing of the evidence is mandatory and is not condonable, the oppositions should be taken to have been abandoned. The same is the usual practice of the Trademark Registry, as per various orders in other matters.  (iii)  Vehement reliance is placed on Rule 112 of the TM Rules as per which if there is any detriment that would be caused to any party, the Registrar cannot exercise the discretion even to obviate the irregularities in any procedure.  (iv)  Rule 14 (3) of the TM Rules provides the manner in which service is to be effected and as per this provision, if the letter was put in post, it is sufficient. In this case, the evidence was put in post for being delivered to the Applicant only on 9th August, 2019, after the time of 2 months had expired. Thus, the deeming provision has to be triggered.  (v)  In fact, the portal of the IPO does not permit or accept online filing once the time for filing has expired and that explains why the physical filing was done by the Opponent.  (vi)  Reliance is placed upon Surinder Corporation v. Hindustan Level  Limited & Anr., 2007 (35) PTC 388 (Del), to submit that the  Registrar has no discretion to even condone the delay. Though, the said judgment was under the old Rule 50 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002, wherein 2+1 (i.e., a maximum period of 3) months was the period for filing of evidence in support of oppositions, the ld. Single Judge had held clearly that there is no discretion of the Registrar to extend the period for filing the same.  (vii)  Since, there is no discretion vested in the Registrar to condone the delay, following similar provisions under the Patents Act, 1970, the delay cannot be condoned. Reliance is placed on Nippon Steel Corporation v. Union of India [W.P. (C) 801 of 2011, decided on 8th February 2011].",

(ii)  The online filing happened on 5th August, 2019. The physical filing, however, happened on 13th August, 2019, though, the same is stated to have been dispatched in time. The filing on 5th August, 2019 is also supported by the report provided by Respondent No.1.  (iii)  Since there is a limit of 5 MB on the document to be uploaded on the Trademark Registry website, the Opponent had no choice to dispatch  the documents physically, which were received on 13th August, 2019.  (iv)  In any event, under Rule 45 (1) of the TM Rules, once the filing is made, there is no specific timeline fixed for service of the copy on the Applicant and in any case, the same is ought to be done simultaneously so long as it is done immediately or within a reasonable time after the filing.",

This is primarily as one of the common defences raised by the defendants (in both the suits) is that the design has been wrongly registered in favour of the plaintiff and is liable to be cancelled for the same having been previously registered in India as also published in India.",

The „sameness‟ of features does not necessarily mean that the two designs must be identical on all points and should differ on none. They have to be substantially the same. The said judgment made a reference to an earlier judgment of the High Court of Calcutta in Western Engineering Co. v. Paul Engineering Co., AIR 1968 Cal 109, wherein it was held that one of the practical tests to find out the identity or the sameness of the design is to find out whether there are substantial differences between the design subsequently registered and the design which was earlier registered. These differences cannot be based on purely subjective or utilitarian or aesthetic considerations, but the differences must be objective in its essential features. A general view of the features of both the designs should be looked into to find out if the one design is as good as the other and the conclusion is to be arrived at by visual examination of the two products. Similarity of device in external appearance must be a relative feature in considering the substantial difference between the two but is certainly not a determining factor.",

The Court must address its mind as to whether the design adopted by the defendants was substantially different from the design which was registered. If the Court is able to find that there is substantial and sufficient resemblance between  the alleged infringed design, an injunction should follow. It further explained that „fraudulent imitation‟ is an imitation which is based upon and deliberately based upon the registered design, though which may be less apparent than an obvious imitation. There would be subtle distinction between the registered design and a fraudulent imitation, and yet the fraudulent imitation, although it is different in some respects from the original, would be an imitation when two designs are closely scanned.",

The introduction of ordinary trade variants into an old design cannot make it new or original. He went on to give the example saying, if it is common practice to have or not to have, spikes in the soles of running shoes, any man does not make a new and original designs out of an old type of running shoes by putting spikes into the soles. The working world, as well as the trade world, is entitled at its will to take, in all cases, its choice of ordinary trade variants for use in particular instance, and no patent and no registration of a design can prevent an ordinary workman from using or not using trade knowledge of this kind. It was emphasized that it is the duty of the Court to take special care that no design is to be counted as \"new and original design\" unless it is distinguished from that previously existed by something essentially new or original which is different from ordinary trade variants which have long been common matters of taste workman who made a coat (of ordinary cut) for a customer should be left in tender whether putting braid on the edges of the coat in the ordinary way so common a few years ago, or increasing the number of buttons or the like, would expose him for the prescribed years to an action for having infringed a registered design. On final analysis, it was emphasized that the use of the words \"new or original\" in the statute is intended to prevent this and that the introduction or substitution of ordinary trade variants in a design is not only insufficient to make the design \"new or original\" but that it did not even contribute to give it a new or original character.

Vide In the matter of Wingate's Registered Design No. 768.611 (52 R.P.C. 126) it was observed that what a substantial difference is, is a question upon which no general principle can be laid down at all; it must depend on the particular facts in each case. In one case a quite small variation in the details of a design may be enough to make the design something quite different from an existing design. On the other hand, there are cases even where quite large alterations in detail leave two designs for all practical purposes the same. The Court has to consider and look at the design in question with an instructed eye and say whether there is or is not such a substantial difference between that which had been published previously and the registered design as to entitle the proprietor of the registered design to say that at the date of registration that was a new or original design and therefore properly registered.",

Class 26 is for „Lighting apparatus‟. Class 26-04 is a sub-class and is for „Luminous sources, electrical or not‟. The Note(s) appended to Class 26-04 clarifies that the sub-class is „including bulbs for electrical lamps, luminous plaques and tubes, and candles.‟ Class 26-05 is for „Lamps, Standard Lamps, Chandeliers, wall and Ceiling fixtures, lampshades, reflectors, photographic and cinematographic projector lamps.‟ Section 6 of the Act provides that a design may be registered in respect of any or all of the articles comprised in a prescribed „class of articles.‟ Any question arising as to the class within which any article falls shall be determined by the Controller, whose decision shall be final. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Act further provides that where a design has been registered in respect of any article comprised in a class of article, the application of the proprietor of  the design to register it in respect of some one or more other articles comprised in that class of articles shall not be refused, nor shall the registration thereof invalidated on the ground of it being so previously registered for the other article or being previously published in India or in any other country by reason of its application to that other article. The proviso further states that the subsequent registration shall not extend the period of copyright in the design beyond that arising from previous registration. Therefore, once a design is registered for one of the articles in a class of articles, the proprietor can claim a right even for other articles in the same class of articles. Equally, someone else cannot claim to become proprietor of the design by seeking registration thereof in another sub-class of the same class of articles. It has not been shown that the classification of the earlier registered articles or that of the plaintiff was determined by the Controller upon contest and therefore, finality is attached to it.",

                        "content": "The expressions „published‟ or „publication‟ are not defined in the Act. Various judgments have however defined these expressions found in the Designs Act. Some judgments define publication as being opposed to one which is kept secret, whereas other judgments define publication as something which is available in public domain i.e. available as of right to any member of the public. We are of course looking into the issue of publication by means of existence in public domain by publication in a paper (which expression “paper‟ is taken to mean any other medium where the design can be judged by the eye) inasmuch as, it was not (and could not be) disputed by both the parties before us that once there is actual use of the design by making an article out of the same, which is commercially exploited and put in public use („by use‟ as stated in Section 4(b) of the Act), there would surely be publication. The issue of publication is accordingly being specifically looked into from  the point of view of whether publication by means of publishing in a paper form available in public generally including of their availability in the office of the Registrar of Designs.  12(i). Let us therefore see what should be the meaning which should be ascribed to the expression „published‟ or „publication‟ when we use such expressions qua „published‟ or „publication‟ in paper form or by depiction in any form which is visible to naked eye without the same having been put in the form of an article. We have already in this regard reproduced the definition of design as per Section 2 (d) of the Act and the definition of expression „original‟ as per Section 2(g) of the Act above, and which sections will be of relevance for discussion of „publication‟.  (ii)  When we read the definition of a „design‟ under Section 2(d) we find that there are inter alia four important aspects in the same. The first aspect is that the design is a design which is meant to produce an article as per the design by an industrial process or means. The second aspect is that design is not the article itself but the conceptual design containing the features of a shape, configuration, pattern, composition of lines etc. Third aspect is the judging of the design which is to be put in the form of finished article solely by the eye. Fourthly, the design which is the subject matter of the Act is not an artistic work which falls under the Copyright Act or a trademark which falls under the Trademarks Act.  (iii)  More clarity is given to the meaning of the word design when we look at the definition of „original‟ as found under Section 2(g). The definition of the expression „original‟ shows that the design though is not new because such design exists in public domain and is otherwise well-known, however, the design is original because it is new in its application i.e. new in its application to a specific article. Therefore, for seeking registration under the Act it is not necessary that the design must be totally new, and it is enough  that the existing design is applied in a new manner i.e. to an article to which that design has not been applied before.  (iv)  So far as the expression „new‟ is concerned, it is well known i.e. it is something which comes into existence for the first time and therefore a new design which comes into existence for the first time obviously will be entitled to copyright protection.  13(i). When we see the provision of Section 4(b) we find that a design which is already disclosed by publication in India or abroad will not be registered, however, the bar for registration of a design which is disclosed to the public in India or abroad is accompanied by the language which requires publication „in a tangible form or by use or in any other way‟. It is this language and the fascicle of expressions „tangible form‟ or „use‟ or „in any other way‟ which requires to be understood and interpreted so as to understand the meaning of the word „publication‟.  (ii)  So far as the expression „by use‟ is concerned, there would be no difficulty because obviously use of the design would be by translating the same into a finished article by an industrial process or means. The real difficulty which arises actually is qua the expressions „tangible form‟ or „in any other way‟. These two expressions on a normal literal interpretation are much wider than the expression „use‟ (the design having been translated to an article). Publication in a paper form or publication as being visible to the naked eye without the same having been put on an article is very much otherwise included in these wide expressions. The question thus is to what extent should there be publication for the same to be in „tangible form‟ or „in any other way‟ for being included within the language of „publication‟ as found in Sections 4(b) and 19(1)(b). Before we answer this question, we would however like to refer to the ratios of the  judgments in the cases of Gopal Glass Works and Dabur India Ltd. cases.  xxxxx",

(ii)  Primacy was given to the Indian registered design because the design which was registered in the U.K. Patent Office was never used qua the article in question viz the glass sheet and the documents downloaded from the internet of the U.K. Patent Office could not be said to have much clarity for being treated as a prior publication qua the specific article in question viz the glass sheet.  (iii)  A foreign registered design cannot be the basis for cancellation under Section 19(1)(a) of a design registered in India unless there is application of a design to an article which is put into public domain/use or unless there would have been complete and sufficient clarity in the documents downloaded through internet from the U.K. Patent Office that it can be held that there is a clear cut clarity qua prior „publication‟.  (iv)  In the facts of that case since there was no clarity from the design downloaded from U.K. Patent office it was held that there was no prior publication.",

Also, the observations of lack of prior publication in facts of that case were made with respect to a design having to be put on an article as differentiated from lack of clarity in a design merely by the same existing in public records, because in the facts of that case the design registered abroad had not been put in use in glass sheets.  xxxxx",

                        "content": "We have extensively quoted the reasoning and ratio in the case of Gopal Glass Works and various facets and factual matrix which led to the conclusion. It will not be correct to read only few paragraphs of the judgment in isolation. In the case of Gopal Glass Works, the Court took into consideration several aspects before reaching its conclusions and para 40 contains one of the aspects. The Division Bench of this Court in its decision in case of Dabur India Ltd. has referred to only paras 39 and 40 of Gopal Glass Works'scase. It is therefore necessary to clarify and elucidate upon the expression „publication‟ as dilated upon in the case of Gopal Glass Works and to what extent and when the registration abroad will result in publication abroad which is specifically covered in Sections 4(b) and 19(1)(b) of the 2000 Act.  19(i) In our opinion the expression „tangible form‟ refers to a specific physical form or shape as applied to an article and not the mere ability to replicate, convert and give a physical shape to the design, though of course to fall under  the expression „tangible form‟ it is not necessary that the article should have been used, but the expression „in any other way‟ takes some of its colour from the words „used‟ or „tangible form‟. The principle of Nositur a Sociis will be applicable. Section 4(b) therefore, not only, requires publication but it should be publication by use, in tangible form or in any other way. The expression „any other way‟ here is wider in context and takes into its ambit a design which has been created though not still put to use or exists in tangible form but at the same time it is guided by the words “use” and “tangible form”. Thus, to disqualify a claim for registration or cancel registration of a design in India, the publication abroad should be by use, in tangible form, or in some other way, means that the design should not be a factum on paper/document alone, but further that the design on paper should be recognizable i.e. have the same impact in the public as a furnished article will appeal when judged solely by the eye (see Section 2(d)). Putting it differently if the design is on paper then it must exist upon a piece of paper in such a way that the shape or other features of the article are made clear to the eye. The visual impact should be similar to when we see the design on a physical object i.e. an object in tangible form/in use. As noted otherwise in the present judgment, registration of a design is article specific and thus-depending on the facts of each case registration or publication of design of a particular article may or may not necessarily result in rejection or cancellation of registration of the same or similar design on another article. The Act protects the original artistic effort not in form of an idea or on its own as an artistic work, but is an embodiment in a commercially produced artefact. Thus the primary concern is what the finished article is to look like. [see observations of the Supreme Court in Bharat Das Tools Ltd. (infra)].  (ii) Registration in a foreign country is one aspect but what can entail rejection of an  application for registration in India or cancellation of registration in India, is prior publication and not registration ipso facto in a foreign country. Moreover, such publication should be of the nature delineated in sub-section 4(b). Registration abroad perse cannot be a ground for cancellation or rejection of a design in India but the registration in India can be impugned if the design is not “new and original” or is already published abroad as stipulated in Section 4(b). In some cases of registration abroad, the same not by itself a ground for rejection/cancellation in India, yet can lead to cancellation if it can be shown and proved that the claim in India is not “new and original” as there was publication abroad and which publication abroad is a publication within the meaning of Section 4(b). In such cases registration can be refused or cancelled. New, original or novelty of the pattern or design when replicated or applied or fully understood by the eye for being applied to an article is a sine qua non to avail and get benefit of the rights under the Act. This underlying principle is accentuated as well as protected when Section 4(b) and 19 stipulate and provide for rejection/cancellation of registration of a design which has been published in any country prior in point of time. Though publication in India or abroad are enlisted as separate grounds under Section 4 and 19 of the Act, they are in a way interlinked and intertwined with the question of whether design is new or original for determining the meaning of “design” as understood and as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act.  (iii) Registration abroad is one aspect and publication abroad in terms of Section 4 (b) is another aspect. There can be and will be cases when registration abroad, may have resulted in publication of a design as stipulated in Section 4(b). In such cases there would be publication abroad, not because the design is registered abroad but because the conditions mentioned in Section 4(b) are satisfied. The observations of the Division Bench in Dabur India Ltd.'s case cannot  be read to mean that though conditions of Section 4(b) are satisfied, the registration of design cannot or should not be cancelled although the design has been registered abroad. Registration abroad and publication abroad are two distinct parameters, each having their own consequences. When registration abroad results in publication under Section 4(b), the said provision gets attracted and necessary consequences as envisaged in Section 4 and 19 will follow.",

Gopal Glass Work's Ltd., (2008) 10 SCC 657. This judgment of the Supreme Court is the judgment which has been passed in an appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Gopal Glass Work's case. A reference to various paragraphs of the Supreme Court's judgment shows that the Supreme Court has taken note of the fact that though design is specifically qua an article, however, publication of a design in a paper form, may amount to prior publication, however, each case has to be necessarily seen and decided as per the facts of that case. The facts of each case must show sufficient amount of clarity qua the design which must necessarily exist in a public record of a Registrar of Designs Office and must have sufficient clarity attached to them before the same can be treated as prior publication. Therefore, really the issue is no longer res integra as to meaning of word “published” or “publication” as found in Sections 19(1)(b) and 4(b) of the Act because Supreme Court has held that existence of documents in public record such as the Office of the Registrar of Designs, will or will not, depending on facts of each particular case be evidence of prior publication.  xxxxx",

(ii)  The provision of Section 44 does not have the effect of changing the literal interpretation of Section 19(1)(a) inasmuch as under Section 44, the foreign registered design becomes an Indian registered design, although, the date of registration of the foreign registered design which is registered in India will relate back and have retrospective effect from the date of application first made in the convention country abroad. Once, the foreign registered design becomes registered in India, the very fact that it is an Indian registered design it will be a previously registered design in India, and by virtue of the priority rule the same will be a ground for cancellation of a design subsequently registered in India on an application made after the date of the priority date given of the application made abroad for registration of the design in a convention country.  (iii)  The benefit of foreign registered design after its registration in India for seeking cancellation of an Indian registered design under Section 19(1)(a) will only be available if the application for registration in India is made within six months of the date of the application made in the convention country abroad, notwithstanding there may be prior publication in this interregnum six month period.  (iv)  In case, the application for registration in India is not made within the statutory permissible period of six months of having made the application abroad, then, the design registered in India in the meanwhile in six months period cannot be cancelled under Section 19(1)(a), though, the foreign registered design owner on proving of prior publication can have an effective  defence to the infringement action filed by the Indian registered design owner and which defence against an infringement action is available vide Section 22 relying on the ground of prior publication under Section 19(1)(b) read with Section 4(b) of the Act.  (v)  What is publication is essentially a question of fact to be decided as per the evidence led in each case. Existence of a design in the publication record/office of a Registrar of design abroad may or may not depending on the facts of each case amount to prior publication and there would be prior publication only if the prior registered design is made public and has that much necessary clarity as applied to a specific article capable of judged by the visual appearance or the eye of the mind, that by use of the said knowledge and information in the public record of the Registrar of design office, an article can be made using that design which will be a piracy or violation of that design i.e. putting it differently unless and until there is complete clarity and understanding to the naked eye or the eye of the mind of the foreign registered design as found in the public record of the Registrar of design qua a specific article, it cannot be said that such public record will amount to prior publication.",

Paragraph 43 of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:- “43.This court is also of the opinion that the Full Bench ruling in Mohan Lal (supra) made an observation, which is inaccurate: it firstly correctly noted that registration as a design is not possible, of a trade mark; it, however later noted that \"post registration under Section 11 of the Designs Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the registrant of the design. The reason being: the use of a registered design as a trade mark, is not provided as a ground for its cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.\" This observation ignores that the Designs Act, Section 19 (e) specifically exposes a registered design to cancellation when \"(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.\" The reason for this is that Section 2 of the Designs Act, defines \"design\" as \"...the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article.......; but does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.....\" Therefore, if the registered design per se is used as a trade mark, it apparently can be cancelled. The larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or \"trade dress\" however, is correct; as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the product through its packaging and so on, given that a \"passing off\" claim can include but is also broader than infringement of a trademark, the cause of action against such use lies.”",

Secondly, the sentence in para 43 of the judgment of Bhat, J. that “the larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or trade dress however, is correct” appears prima facie to place the issue beyond doubt that the FJB in Carlsberg upheld the view of the majority of the FB in Mohan Lal that a passing off action was indeed maintainable in respect of a registered design used as a trademark. To this Court is appears prima facie on a reading of the above para 43, together with the preceding and succeeding para, as a whole that the only qualification in Carlsberg was that if such registered design was used as a trademark then it can lead to the cancellation of the registration of such design. The words “as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the products through its packaging and so on” has to be seen in the context of the discussion preceding it which turns on what can be registered as a design and what cannot.

Senior Counsel appearing for the Patentee is six-fold:  i)  The names of the members constituting the Opposition Board is still not known to the Patentee as the same is not reflected in the document i.e., the recommendation.  ii)  During the pendency of the post grant opposition, the affidavits filed on behalf of the Opponent were given up as the Patentee had sought cross-examination of the said witnesses. The said affidavits having been given up, the same could not have been relied upon by the Opposition Board in its recommendation.  iii)  The second recommendation of the Opposition Board dated 16th February, 2022 is almost identical to the first recommendation which was earlier submitted on 21st August, 2019. A tabular chart is referred to establish this allegation. Thus, there has been gross non-application of mind by the Opposition Board in the second round.  iv)  That the representations, despite the orders passed by the Court, have not been properly decided by the Patent Office and this by itself would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.  v)  The two affidavits of Mr. John F. Carpenter and Ms. Dorthe Kot Engelund filed on behalf of the Patentee have not been  considered by the Opposition Board.  vi)  The recommendation of the Opposition Board dated 16th February, 2022 referred to an affidavit of Ravindra Agarwal dated 29th September, 2014 whereas no such affidavit has been filed on record.",

He further points out that irrespective of whether the Opponent•s evidence is on record or not, the grounds raised in the post grant opposition shall be considered by the Patent Office inasmuch as Rule 57 of the Rules does not mandatorily require filing of evidence. As per the Rules, the Opponent has the option of filing evidence if it chooses to do so. In order to avoid further delay in this matter, the Opponent had given up the evidence by way of affidavits which were filed by it. The Opponent had also given up cross-examination of the Patentee•s witnesses to its detriment only in order to seek expeditious hearing of the post-grant opposition.",

If the patentee does not contest or file a reply/ evidence, the patent would be deemed to be revoked;  iii)  Upon the Patentee filing its reply statement, the opponent has the opportunity to file the reply evidence (hereinafter •Opponent•s Rejoinder•) within one month upon receiving the patentee•s reply. However, the said rejoinder would have to be strictly confined to the matters which have been raised in the patentee•s evidence. Thus, there is no permissibility for the opponent to expand the scope of the rejoinder beyond the reply filed by the Patentee;  iv)  The Opposition Board constituted under Rule 56 would then consider all the documents filed by the parties and submit a report along with its joint recommendation to the Controller.  Thus, the scheme of the Rules envisages that the Opposition Board ought to consider all the pleadings and documents prior to giving its recommendations.

The Controller, after hearing the parties if they so desire and after taking into consideration the recommendation of the Opposition Board, has to decide the opposition giving reasons. Provisions of the Act and the Rules, therefore, clearly indicate that the Opposition Board has to make its recommendations after considering the written statement of opposition, reply statement, evidence adduced, by the parties with reasons on each ground taken by the parties. Rule 62 also empowers the Controller to take into consideration the reasons stated by the Opposition Board in its Report. In other words, the Report of The Opposition Board has got considerable relevance while taking a decision by The Controller under Section 25 (4) of the Act read with Rule 62 (5) of the Rules.  The Opposition Board in a given case may make recommendation that the patent suffers from serious defects like lack of novelty, lack of inventive steps etc., so also it can recommend that the patent shall be granted since the invention has novelty, inventive steps etc. Such recommendations are made after examining the evidence adduced by the parties before it. Unless the parties are informed of the reasons, for making such recommendations they would not be able to effectively advance their respective contentions before the Controller. Section 25 (3) (b) read with Rule 56 (4)  cast no obligation on the Opposition Board to give a copy of the Report to either of the parties. So also no obligation is cast under Section 25(4) or under Rule 62 on the Controller to make available the report of the recommendation of the Opposition Board. But considering the fact that the Report of the Opposition Board can be crucial in the decision making process, while passing order by the Controller under Section 25 (4), principles of natural justice must be read into those provisions of the Report/recommendation of Opposition Board, therefore, should be made available to the parties before the Controller passes orders under Section 25(4) of the Act.•",

Since the Opposition Board is to be constituted of three members, there is no reason whatsoever as to why the names of members of the Opposition Board should either be masked or missing from the said recommendation. As is seen in the present case, the initial recommendation of the Opposition Board did not contain the names of the members constituting the Board. Their signatures were also not visible in the document. In the final recommendations which are on record, only the name of Chairperson of the Opposition Board has been mentioned. This would be completely nontransparent and would result in proceedings being filed and challenges being made to the recommendation. Moreover, in order to preserve the integrity of the recommendation of the Opposition Board, it is necessary to ensure that the names of the members constituting the Opposition Board are clearly reflected both on the cover page and on the final page where the members should append their signatures to the recommendation. It is, accordingly,  directed that henceforth the ld. Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (CGPDTM) shall ensure that the names of the members constituting the Opposition Board are clearly mentioned on the cover page and the recommendations are duly signed by the members of the Opposition Board.",

His first argument is that product by process claims are primarily product claims and are tested for novelty and inventive step qua the product and not the process. The core of the claim in a product by process patent would only be the product. The Appellant, by removing the product related claims and converting them into process claims, is changing the very nature of the claims which is impermissible. Thus, the same ought not to be allowed. He relies upon the decision of the IPAB in Research Foundation of State University of New  York in OA/11/2009/PT/DEL dated 10th August, 2012 to place before the Court the nature of product by process claims and the manner in which they are examined. The relevant portion of the same is as under:  “42. In view of above judgment, we also feel that product-by-process claims must also define a novel and unobvious product, and that its patentability cannot depend on the novelty and unobviousness of the process limitations alone. Therefore, the patentability of a product by process claim is based on the product itself if it does not depend on the method of production. In other words, if the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a prior product, the claim is un-patentable even if the prior art product was made by a different process. Accordingly, the product by process claim must define a novel and un-obvious product and the patentability in such claim cannot depend on the novelty and un-obviousness of the process limitation alone.”",

Reliance is placed upon paragraph 7.9 of the said Guidelines. The same is extracted below:  A claim to a product obtained or produced by a process is anticipated by any prior disclosure of that particular product per se, regardless of its method of production. In a product-by-process claim, by using only process terms, the applicant seeks rights to a product, not a process. The IPAB held in ORDER No. 200/2012 “…..product-by-process claims must also define a novel and  unobvious product, and that its patentability cannot depend on the novelty and unobviousness of the process limitations alone. Therefore, the patentability of a product by process claim is based on the product itself if it does not depend on the method of production. In other words, if the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a prior product, the claim is un-patentable even if the prior art product was made by a different process. Accordingly the product by process claim must define a novel and un-obvious product and the patentability in such claim cannot depend on the novelty and un-obviousness of the process limitation alone”  Therefore, in product-by-process claims, the applicant has to show that the product defined in process terms, is not anticipated or rendered obvious by any prior art product.

He makes reference to the claims as originally filed. It is his submission that the focus of the claims as originally filed was only a product, namely, ‘copolymer latex’. The novelty and inventive step by the Appellant were claimed only in the  product and not in the process. In the originally filed claims there are no details about the process in which exclusivity is claimed. As per the submission of the ld. CGSC, the Appellant is trying to convert ‘product’ claims to ‘product by process’ claims and then convert the ‘product by process’ claims to ‘process’ claims. Thus, in essence, the Appellant is trying to convert a ‘product patent’ into a ‘process patent’ which is not permissible in view of the legislative scheme of the Patent Act, 1970. The Appellant is merely using jugglery of words in order to change the scope of the claims itself which is impermissible.

Since the ‘copolymer latex’ claims have been changed to ‘method’ claims, the scope of the invention has been changed.  •  The method claims are beyond the scope of the claims as originally filed and are not supported by the description;  •  That which is not claimed is disclaimed. Since the method claims were not claimed at the time of filing, the said claims are disclaimed;  •  As per Section 59(1) of the Act, an amendment of the claims cannot be allowed if the amended claims would not fall wholly within the scope of the claims before the amendment. The method claims are beyond the scope of the claims as originally filed; thus, the amendment is not allowable;  •  The method claims disclose a method of emulsion polymerisation for obtaining copolymer latex, however, this method of emulsion polymerisation is already disclosed in the cited documents.

However, in the case of a process claim, the exclusivity or the monopoly is restricted to the manner/method by which a particular product is manufactured and if the same product is manufactured or achieved through a different process/method, the exclusivity of the patentee cannot usually extend to such different process or to the product manufactured by the different process. When there are ‘product by process’ claims, however, the extent of monopoly depends upon the reading of the claims in each case. In the present case, the amendment of the claims from ‘product by process claims’, wherein the copolymer latex has various features and can be manufactured by the process described in the specification, to merely the process of manufacturing the copolymer latex is clearly a step down for the patentee.",

CGSC places reliance on the Ayyangar Committee Report to argue that change in category of claims from ‘product by process claims’ to ‘process claims’ is not permissible. The said Report analyzes the provisions relating to amendment of specification in the U.K. Patent Act, 1907-46. It also analyzed the decision of the House of Lords in May and Baker Ltd and Others v. Boots Pure Drug Company Ltd [1950] UKHL 1 wherein the House of Lords interpreted the power to amend claims very narrowly on the basis of section 21(6) of the UK Patents Act, 1907-1946. The said decision was criticized on the ground that the power of amendment ought not to be unduly restricted as such restrictions would deprive an inventor of a valuable invention of its legitimate rights. Later, Section 21(6) of the Act of 1907-1946, on which the decision in May and Baker’s case (supra) was based was modified. After considering the history of the power of amendment in the UK, the Ayyangar Committee Report observed as under:  “553. Having considered the matter carefully, have reached the conclusion that there is no need to change the scope of the existing provision as regards the power of amendment and that where the invention which emerges as a result of an amendment is  different from that which was the subject matter of the specification as originally accepted, such an amendment should not be permitted. I might add that section 50 of the Canadian Patents Act restricts reissue of patents to “the same invention” as that for which the original patent was issued, and though that Act has been amended from time to time, even as late as 1953-54, no change has been made in the wording of this provision.",

It is then wholly a matter between the applicant for the patent and the office, and such amendments as are necessary to afford to the applicant, the benefit of the invention which he has disclosed in his complete specification ought to be available to him. On the other hand, after the acceptance of the application, and its advertisement, the contents of specification become open to public inspection, and the rights of third parties who have started work on the basis of the claims made or not made, by the applicant in the published specification should be taken into account in defining the scope of the amendment which the applicant or the patentee might be permitted to effect. After a complete specification has been accepted two limitations not applicable to amendments at the earlier stage should be imposed. The first is in regard to the formulation of new claims which were not found in the original specification. Where a complete specification has not been advertised, there would be no question of a dedication of the unclaimed portion of the invention to the public and hence there cannot be  any objection to a claim being formulated in respect of an invention disclosed in the specification if by error the claim has not been properly made or formulated. But where the specification has been accepted and advertised, the position is entirely different. In that case unless the claim after amendment would fairly fall within the claim before amendment it should not be permitted.

The relevant observation of the IPAB is as  under:  “36. Keeping in view the settled principles of law, on amendments of the claims, we agree that no new claim may be allowed.

In the opinion of the Court, the amended claims of the Appellant satisfy the conditions of Section 59(1) of the Act as specified above.
