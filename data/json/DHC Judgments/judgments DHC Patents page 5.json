ADJ who was not designated as a Commercial Court. Upon enquiring the reason for the same, the Court was informed that the suit is valued below Rs.3,00,000/and thus, in view of the pecuniary provisions in the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (hereinafter “CCA”), where the ‘specified value’ for ‘commercial disputes’ is 3,00,000/-, read with Section 134 the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter “Trademarks Act”) where a suit relating to trademarks is to be filed and heard only by a District Court, the suit was marked to a District Judge, not designated as a Commercial Court. The logical corollary of this is that the provisions of the CCA also are not made applicable to such a suit. The Court found this situation to be quite peculiar and, accordingly, passed the following order on 2nd March, 2022:  “10. Another peculiar question has also arisen in this suit. It is noticed that the matter arises out of an order passed by the ld. ADJ-03 in the Patiala House Courts Complex, Delhi, who is not designated as a “commercial court”.

Various orders showing the pendency of such cases before the ADJs are relied upon.  •  Reliance is placed upon the provisions of the CCA, especially, the definition of ‘specified value’ in Section 2(c)(xvii) read with Section 12 which provides for determination of ‘specified value’. In view of these provisions, any suit which is valued below Rs.3,00,000/-cannot be listed before or adjudicated upon by a Commercial Court.

                        "content": "Ms. Swathi Sukumar, ld. Amicus Curiae, has given a written note of arguments and has also made her submissions as under:  •  For the Commercial Court to exercise jurisdiction, the twin test of pecuniary and subject-matter jurisdiction has to be satisfied. This position has been upheld by various decisions such as:  (i) Kirloskar (supra);  (ii)  Fine Footwear (supra);  (iii)  Bharat Bhogilal (supra);  (iv)  Neelkanth Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Neelkanth Healthchem, AIR 2018 Raj 67, AIR 2018 Raj 67; and  (v)  Ambala Sarabhai Enterprises Limited v. K S Infraspace LLP and Anr., 2020 (15) SCC 585.  •  While, initially, prescribing the ‘specified value’ of commercial suits at Rs.1 crore, and thereafter, reducing the same to Rs.3,00,000/-vide the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (hereinafter “2018 Amendment”), the Legislature was conscious of the value of the dispute and, thus, the same cannot be ignored.  •  Reliance is placed upon Section 134 of the Trademarks Act and provisions of the CCA to submit that the provisions of the two statutes ought to be harmoniously construed to arrive at the forum which will have jurisdiction in such matters. Thus, the definition of ‘specified value’ cannot be ignored.  •  In this endeavor, the Court ought to examine the question as to whether a particular suit has been valued arbitrarily. The Delhi High Court has clearly held in Subhashini Malik v. S.K. Gandhi & Ors., (2016) 233 DLT 83, that the plaintiff being the dominus litis has a choice to choose the forum and remedy. However, the valuation of the IPR suits below Rs.3 lakhs, has led to a situation where the plaintiff is not only exercising the right to choose the Court before which the matter would be listed, but is also avoiding the rigors of the substantial provisions of the CCA. According to Ms. Sukumar, the  CCA is not merely a procedural law as various substantial provisions may affect the manner in which ‘commercial disputes’ are adjudicated.  •  This raises the issue of two competing factors: (i) the twin test of pecuniary and subject matter jurisdiction that has to be satisfied by a suit for applicability of CCA; and (ii) public policy considerations which prohibit forum-shopping and habitual undervaluation of suits.  •  Notably, the repercussions of undervaluation of suits are high and it would defeat the very purpose of the CCA. Thus, the Court ought to lift the veil on the valuation made by plaintiff in such matters and the plaintiff’s right is not unfettered.  •  In light of the above, it is clear that the valuation ought not to be whimsical or arbitrary and if it is, then the Court ought to intervene.  •  Ms. Sukumar, places reliance on the following decisions to support her submissions that the Court is entitled to examine the valuation and the manner in which it may do so:  (i)  Meenakshisundaram Chettiar v. Venkatachalam Chettiar, (1980) 1 SCC 616;  (ii)  Abdul Hamid Shamsi v. Abdul Majid, (1988) 2 SCC 575;  (iii)  Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. All India Bharat Sanchar Nigam Executives’ Association (Regd.) & Ors. (2006) 130 DLT 195; and  (iv)  Lalit Babbar v. Ramson Prime Technologies Pvt. Ltd., [CS(Comm.) 1857/2020, decided on 23rd December, 2020].  •  The guidance for estimating the value of the suit, may be drawn from the CCA. Under Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA, where the relief sought  in a suit, appeal or application relates to any intangible right, the market value of the intangible right is to be looked at. Thus, the valuation of a suit in intellectual property matters can be made more stringent, by requiring the plaintiff to furnish information on the market value of the right.  •  Further, in the case of trademarks, by a mere assessment of the period for which the brand has been used, the Court can assess the market value of the intangible right. Similarly, royalty rates may be required to be disclosed along with total expected royalty amount.",

There is no repugnancy between the provisions of the IPR statutes and the CCA.  •  However, since in Delhi the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts is Rs.3 lakhs and above, and the same also matches with the ‘specified value’ for the ‘commercial disputes’ at the District Court level, the IPR disputes which have to anyway be listed only before the District Judges, may be placed before the District Judge (Commercial). This is in view of the fact that under Article 236 of the Constitution, the District Judge includes the Judge of a City Civil Court, ADJ, etc. Thus, both the ADJ (non-Commercial) and ADJ  (Commercial), would constitute the District Court. Further, as held in  Kesavarapu Venkateswarlu & Ors. v. Sardharala Satanaryana & Ors., AIR 1957 AP 49, a Superior Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of a dispute maintainable before an Inferior Court, as the Superior Court would not lack inherent jurisdiction, as long as it has subject-matter jurisdiction.  •  Consequently, both District Judges – Commercial and non-Commercial – have subject matter jurisdiction over IPR disputes, but neither has the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction as the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts, even for ordinary civil suits, starts at Rs. 3 lakhs.  •  Therefore, since ADJs have to hear IPR matters irrespective of their value, administratively, the matters can be listed before the ADJs holding Commercial Courts.  •  He underscores his submissions with the caveat that Delhi stands in a peculiar position to use this interpretation, in as much as in case of IPR suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, there are no District Judges/ADJs who have the pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the same.",

                        "content": "Mr. Sidharth Chopra, ld. counsel, submits as under:  •  Section 15 of the CPC, which provides that every suit shall be instituted in the Court of the lowest grade competent to try it, is merely a rule of procedure and not of jurisdiction. Therefore, it would not oust the jurisdiction of higher Courts (such as Commercial Courts), which have substantive jurisdiction over the subject matter.  •  In view of this legal position, Mr. Chopra, ld. Counsel, emphasizes, the fact that in IPR cases, the policy decision of the Legislature is to have the same adjudicated upon by the District Courts, irrespective of a lower pecuniary value. To support this contention, Mr. Chopra relies upon the various notifications and provisions of the IPR statutes. According to him, pecuniary value of an IPR suit is irrelevant.  •  Reliance is also placed upon Dashrath B. Rathod v. Fox Star Studios India Pvt. Ltd. (2017 SCC OnLine Bom 345), where the Bombay High Court has clearly held that monetary value is inconsequential in an IPR dispute.  •  An analogy is drawn with arbitration cases relying upon Rahisuddin v. Gambit Leasing & Finance Pvt. Ltd., 2011 (176) DLT 696, where the Court held that a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ought to be filed before a Court not inferior to  a District Court in terms of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act.  •  He also points out that in most IPR statutes like patents/designs, when a cancellation/revocation of patent/design is sought, the matters are automatically listed before the High Court irrespective of pecuniary valuation.1  •  Further, in so far as the ‘specified value’ under the CCA is concerned, the important features of the provisions of the CCA have been considered by the Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai (supra). He seeks to distinguish the decision in Soni Dave (supra) by arguing that the said judgment was in the context of immovable properties not used in trade or commerce. Since not all categories of immovable properties constitute ‘commercial disputes’, the Court had to adjudicate as to which kind of cases would be construed as ‘commercial disputes’. The said decision would not be applicable in case of IPR disputes.  •  In Super Cassettes Industries Pvt. Ltd. M/s Goldy Industries Pvt. Ltd. [CS(COMM) 775/2016, decided on 17th August, 2016], the Court was merely interpreting the first proviso to Section 7 of the CCA as to whether suits, which are valued below the ‘specified value’, ought to be permitted to be filed in the High Court or not. At the time of the said case, the 2018 Amendment reducing the pecuniary value of the ‘commercial disputes’ from Rs.1 crore to Rs.3 lakhs was yet to be introduced. Therefore, the Super Cassettes (supra) decision would be inapplicable in adjudicating the issue currently being  decided by the Court.  •  Allowing an interpretation contrary to the above submissions, and the manner in which IPR suits are now sought to be adjudicated in two parallel streams, one under the CCA and one under the CPC, would be improper and contrary to the intention behind the enactment of the CCA. The plaintiff ought not to be permitted to escape the rigorous of the CCA by merely valuing the suit at less than Rs.3 lakhs in an arbitrary and whimsical manner.  •  Therefore, though the plaintiff has the right to value a suit in terms of the Full Bench decision in Subhashini Malik (supra), since IPR litigation is treated as a separate class of litigation, the plaintiff ought not to be permitted to escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA simply due to valuation of the suit being below Rs. 3 lakhs.  •  Reliance is placed upon the order passed by the Commercial Court in Delhi in Lalit Babbar (supra) which held that the provisions of the CCA have to be read harmoniously with the Court Fees Act, 1870 (hereinafter “Court Fees Act”) and the Suits Valuation Act, 1887 (hereinafter “Suits Valuation Act”).",

As held in the  said decision, the ‘specified value’ under Section 2(i) of the CCA, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a suit, determined as per Section 12 of the CCA.  •  She further relies upon Commercial Aviation & Travel Company v. Vimani Pannalal, (1988) SCC 423, to argue that the plaintiff has the freedom to make a reasonable assessment and value the suit, but the same cannot be arbitrary.  •  In Kalla Yadagiri v. Kotha Bal Reddy, (1999) 1 ALD 222 (FB), the Andhra Pradesh High Court has held that the value of the subject matter of the suit would be the value of the relief claimed. The said decision reads as under:  “25. As noted above, clause (i) of Section 2 of the Act defines “Specified Value”, in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 [which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government”.

Thus, such suits would should automatically be filed and listed before the Commercial Courts.  •  In any event, the question of ‘specified value’ ought not to be given so much importance so as to control the jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts itself. A mischief ought not to be allowed by having two sets of jurisdictions under two separate substantive provisions, basis pecuniary value. Accordingly, IPR statues and CCA provisions have to be harmoniously construed. In this regard, Section 21 of the CCA has an overriding effect and therefore, the objective of speedy resolution of disputes is to be given importance.  •  Finally, even if Commercial Courts do not have jurisdiction over an IPR dispute with a ‘specified value’ of less than Rs.3 lakhs, in V Ramamirtham v. Rama Film Service, AIR 1951 Mad 93, it has been held that while a Court does not have a jurisdiction to try a suit valued above its maximum pecuniary jurisdiction, the converse may not be true. Thus, a Court having jurisdiction to hear matters of a higher pecuniary jurisdiction, for instance, a Commercial Court, can dispose of a suit instituted in a court of a lower grade.",

Such procedures are case management hearings, truncated trials, summary judgments, etc. The following, as submitted by Mr. Dushyant K. Mahant, ld. Counsel, is an illustration of the difference in the provisions between the CPC and CCA, which is to enable the speeder disposal of ‘commercial disputes’:  (ii)  Thus, litigants in civil suits being ‘commercial disputes’ but not of ‘specified value’, are not governed by the CCA, and would not be able to take the benefit of the unique procedures provided in the CCA. This of course, in effect, has a negative  impact on the speedy adjudication of IPR disputes themselves.  (iii)  Even in the Statement of Object and Reasons, as cited by Ms. Sukumar, ld. Amicus, the purpose behind the 2018 Amendment is borne out as under:  “2. The global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, India needs to further improve its ranking in the World Bank 'Doing Business Report' which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. Further, the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership, etc., which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. Needless to say that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive Indian legal system. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015.  xxx xxx xxx",

The relief in the instant suit is for a decree of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to quit from the building described in plaint A and B schedules with damages for loss of user and occupation at the rate of Rs.10,42,125.00 per month from the date of suit till delivery of possession and the petitioner has paid court fees under Section 27(c). In a suit for injunction simplicitor, it is the value of the relief claimed and not the value of the property involved that determines the jurisdiction. \"Subject matter\" is the substance for adjudication and has reference to the right which the plaintiff seeks to enforce and the valuation of the suit depends upon the value of the subject matter. Similar question was considered by the High Court of Delhi in Mrs.Soni Dave (supra). After careful scrutiny of Section 12 of the Act and the relevant provision of the Court Fees Act, it was held as follows;  \"27. In my view Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act providing for determination of specified value as defined in Section 2(i) thereof is not intended to provide for a new mode zof determining the valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction and court fees. It would be incongruous to hold that while for the purpose of payment of court fees the deemed fiction provided in the Court Fees Act for determining the value of the property is to apply but not for determining the specified value under the Commercial Courts Act.",

However, the Karnataka High Court in Kirloskar (supra) – a case concerning IPR – held as under:  “8. The twin requirements of this Act are that a dispute has to be a commercial dispute, and secondly, it must be of certain pecuniary limit, namely Rs.3,00,000/-or above. The term commercial dispute has been defined in Section 2(c) of the Act. Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) clearly deals with the intellectual property rights relating to registered, and unregistered trademarks. Undoubtedly, the present case deals with a trademark the usage of trademark by the appellant, which according to the respondent plaintiff is an illegal usage. Thus, the subject matter of the dispute does relate to intellectual property rights. Hence, the dispute is a commercial dispute as defined by Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the Act. 9. The Karnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act deals with the calculation of Court Fees. Section 26 of the said Act clearly states that in a suit for injunction, whether the subject-matter of the suit has a market value, or not, the fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint, or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher. Therefore, a distinction has to be made between the value of the subject-matter, and the calculation of Court fees. According to Section 26(c), the Court fee shall be based on the relief sought, and the value of the relief mentioned in the plaint. Admittedly, in the present case, in the plaint, the relief sought was valued as Rs.3,000/-. But nonetheless, the value of the subject-matter, that is the infringement of the trademark, has not been stated. But considering the fact that the dispute relates to the infringement of trademark that too by a company, the value of the subject matter can safely be taken to be more than Rs.3,00,000/-.”",

The question had arisen in the context of a communication received from the ld. District & Sessions Judge, Mr. Dinesh Kumar (as he then was), relating to the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts. In the said letter, the concerned ld. District Judge had brought to the notice of the Committee, the confusion that had arisen in respect of transferring of IPR cases to Commercial Courts. The Committee, consisting of then Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.S. Endlaw and Hon’ble Mr. Justice Yogesh Khanna, considered the said communication and, in its minutes dated 4th February, 2020, directed as under:  “Considered and discussed. Section 134 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 states that no suit for the infringement or relating to any right in a registered trademark or for passing of regarding any trademark “shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.” The words “inferior to a District Court” have been interpreted and held to mean the court of a District Judge and not the Court of the Senior Civil Judge or the Civil Judge. Therefore, matters pertaining to trademark in which the relief even if valued less than Rs.3,00,000/-can be entertained only by the courts of District Judge/Additional District Judge at the District Court level.  The question whether a suit within the meaning of Section 134 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 can at all be permitted to be valued at less than Rs.3,00,000/-which court fees paid on valuation below Rs.3,00,000/-is maintainable or not may be left to be decided on the judicial side by the court of the District Judge  As regards the previous notification of this Court nominating all courts of District Judge/Additional District Judge as Commercial Courts, in view of establishment of dedicated courts of District Judge (Commercial Court), the Committee recommends that the order No. 58/DHC/Gaz/G-1/VI.E2(a)/2018 dated 7.7.2018 vide which all the District Judge/Additional District judges were designated as Commercial Courts be withdrawn with immediate effect.”",

The legal position as to suit valuation, choice of forum, payment of Court fee, etc., both before and after the enactment of the CCA, as emerging from various judicial decisions, is summarized below:  (i)   To decide the valuation and Court fee payable in a case, the Court should look into the allegations in the plaint and examine the substantive reliefs. Mere astuteness in drafting the plaint will not be allowed to stand in the way of the Court to look into the substance of the relief sought. Whimsical valuation is thus not permitted.  (ii)  Valuation of a suit has to be adequate and reasonable. The plaintiff cannot deliberately/arbitrarily undervalue the relief. There must be a genuine effort by the plaintiff to estimate the relief. [Meenakshisundaram Chettiar v. Venkatachalam Chettiar, (1980) 1 SCC 616];  (iii)  If the valuation given by the plaintiff is arbitrary and  unreasonable, the Court may reject the same and permit the plaintiff to correct the valuation or have the plaint rejected. The valuation must not be arbitrary or manifestly inadequate. [Abdul Hamid Shamsi v.  (iv)   The plaintiff cannot whimsically choose a ridiculous figure for filing the suit in an arbitrary manner where there are positive materials or objective standards of valuation of the relief, on the face of the plaint. [Commercial Aviation & Travel Company v. Vimani Pannalal, (1988) SCC 423]  (v)   The plaintiff has to give definite reasons for not ascertaining the exact value of the relief. If the exact valuation is not done, on the basis of certain basic requirements, the plaintiff’s discretion would become arbitrary. Lack of bonafides would also cloud the right of the plaintiff to value the suit as per its own will. The Court can then compel the plaintiff to examine the plaint and would require the plaintiff to pay the requisite ad valorem Court fee. [Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. All India Bharat Sanchar Nigam Executives’ Association (Regd.) & Ors. (2006) 130 DLT 195]  (vi)   The plaintiff being the dominus litis, can choose its forum. However, this prerogative or convenience for the plaintiff cannot eclipse the requirement of justice. The right to choose the forum is not an absolute one and can be taken away. [Subhashini Malik v. S.K.  (vii)   A court of a higher grade does not lack inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute which could have been entertained by a lower court, whereas the same would not hold good in the reverse situation.  (viii)   There are three categories of jurisdiction: (i)Territorial jurisdiction; (ii)Pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii)Subject matter jurisdiction. It is only if the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that it would lack inherent jurisdiction. [Harshad Chiman Lal Modi  v. D.L.F. Universal Ltd. And Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 791 and Mantoo Sarkar v Oriental Insurance Company Limited & Ors., (2009) 2 SCC 244]  (ix)  The intention of the underlying statutes has to be considered and given effect to, unless it leads to an absurdity. The construction of a statute ought to be such as to advance the intention of the legislation and remedy any mischief. [Glaxo Laboratories v. Presiding Officer, AIR 1984 SC 505]  (x) When there are multiple suits which could govern any subject matter, the endeavour of the Court ought to be to apply a harmonious construction to the said provisions, especially when there is no repugnancy or inconsistency.

It is very unlikely that the valuation in suits where one of the reliefs sought is for damages and/or rendition of accounts, is less than Rs.3 lakhs. However, even in some cases where damages or rendition of accounts is sought, the ingenuity of lawyers and litigants does lead to suits being valued at less than Rs.3 lakhs.

                        "content": "For instance, in the present appeal which is before this Court, the mark being sought to be protected is ‘VPL INDIA’ against the Defendant’s mark ‘BPI’. The turnover of the Plaintiff as pleaded in the suit and as per the CA Certificate placed on record dated 5th August, 2021, is approximately Rs.67306 lakhs over the last three financial years, i.e., 2018-2021. Moreover, the Plaintiff has stated in its plaint that it has “commanded handsome sales running into Billions of Rupees”. It is also stated to have spent “enormous amounts of money” in advertising and publicity. The said mark, including the label, is stated to have extensive goodwill and reputation, having been adopted in 1988, with copyright and trademark  registrations dating back to 2006. The Plaintiff has stated that it has reputed clients such as Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam, NTPC, BSNL, MTNL, L&T, etc., across India and worldwide. The Plaintiff is also stated to have extensive reach and online presence through both its website and third-party sites like IndiaMART, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The Plaintiff also has numerous quality certifications and recognitions, including ISO, BIS, and One Star Export House (recognized by the Director General of Foreign Trade). Despite all these facts, it is puzzling that the reliefs of injunction as also delivery-up, are valued at Rs. 200/-each for Court fee and jurisdiction, which is much below Rs.3 lakhs. The Court fee paid is Rs.100/-for such reliefs. Additionally, the relief of rendition of accounts is valued at Rs. 1000/-and Court fees of Rs. 150/-is paid for the same. Such a course of action appears to be quite unusual and quixotic, as there is no basis in the suit as to why a trademark suit of a brand having such a huge turnover is sought to be valued at such a low threshold. Moreover, the suit in the present case does not mention the ‘specified value’ at all, but merely the value of reliefs sought.",

                        "paragraph_number": 74,
                        "content": "To answer the above, first, the discussion in paragraph 25 above is pertinent, as it clearly shows that IPR disputes are a set of disputes which lie only before the District Court. Thus, in that sense, such disputes are an exception to the rule of institution of cases at the Court of the lowest level having jurisdiction. With the enactment of the CCA, the subject-matter jurisdiction over IPR disputes now vests with the Commercial Courts, at the District Court Level. Therefore, can litigants and lawyers escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA by valuing the suits below Rs.3 lakhs? The answer ought to be a clear ‘NO’. This is due to the following reasons:  (i)  The application of the judicial principles that the plaintiff is dominus litis and is free to value the suit in the manner it so chooses, has to be in the context of enactment of the CCA. The principles cannot be stretched to justify undervaluation of IPR disputes and payment of lower Court fee.  (ii)  Not ascribing a ‘specified value’ in the suit would be contrary to the scheme of the CCA which requires every suit to have a ‘specified value’, if the subject matter of the suit is a ‘commercial dispute’. A perusal of Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA does offer some guidance, that the ‘specified value’ in case of intangible rights would be the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff.  (iii)  In IPR disputes, the relief of injunction or damages may be  valued by the plaintiff, at an amount lower than the sum of Rs.3 lakhs and Court fee may be paid on that basis. If such valuation is permitted, despite some objective criteria being available for valuing IPR -in the CCA -it would defeat the very purpose of the enactment of special provisions for IPR statutes and the CCA. These statutes would have to be harmoniously construed i.e., in a manner so as to further the purpose of the legislation and not to defeat it. Thus, it would be mandatory for IPR suits to be ascribed a ‘specified value’, in the absence of which the valuation of the suit below Rs.3 lakhs would be arbitrary, whimsical and wholly unreasonable. In this view, intellectual property rights being intangible rights, some value would have to be given to the subject matter of the dispute as well. The Court would have to take into consideration the ‘specified value’ based upon not merely the value of the relief sought but also the market value of the intangible right involved in the said dispute.  (iv)  The subject matter of IPR disputes is usually trademarks, rights in copyrightable works, patents, designs and such other intangible property. The said amount of Rs.3 lakhs is the estimation of the legislature as being the lowest threshold in any ‘commercial dispute’ in India which deserves to benefit from speedier adjudication, owing to the economic progress in the country. The intention of the Legislature in keeping a lower threshold in a ‘commercial dispute’ of Rs.3 lakhs cannot be rendered meaningless. It would only be in exceptional cases that valuation of IPR disputes below Rs.3 lakhs could be justified. Accordingly, Section 12(1)(d) has been included in the CCA, where the subject matter of “intellectual property” has been  contemplated by the Legislature to be an intangible right, in respect of which the market value has to be estimated by the plaintiff, for determining the ‘specified value’.  (v)  The average Court fee paid in Delhi in any civil suit is approximately 3% to 1% of the pecuniary value ascribed to the suit. In fact, Delhi is one of the territories where ad valorem Court fee is paid beyond a particular threshold. When seen from this perspective, i.e., that at Rs.3 lakhs, the Court fee payable is minimal, it is apparent that the only reason for which IPR disputes may be valued below Rs.3 lakhs by litigants or lawyers would be to indulge in forum shopping and bench hunting and not merely to exercise the option of the forum where relief is sought. The purpose would also be to escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA. Such a practice would constitute abuse by plaintiffs of their rights, at the very least.  (vi)  Usually, IPR disputes are filed by business entities. However, considering the Court fee payable even if such suits are valued at a minimum of Rs.3,00,000/-, even individual IPR owners would be easily able to afford the Court fee at the rate of 1-3%. There thus appears to be no valid or justifiable cause to value an IPR suit below Rs.3 lakhs except for oblique motives. Thus, the discretion vested in the plaintiff to value the suit as it pleases, ought not to be extended or stretched to an extent that it encourages malpractice, misuse, abuse and forum shopping.",

As is obvious, such a passing off action would be based on a plea that : the design, which is an unregistered mark, was being used by the plaintiff for the purposes of business; and that the plaintiff's goods and/or services had acquired a reputation and/or goodwill, which were identified in the minds of the consumers, by associating the design/the mark, with the goods and/or services.

The defendants had argued that the reasoning in Mohan Lal (supra) with respect to impermissibility of joinder of the claims vis-à-vis design infringement and passing off, is sound. In this regard it was argued that there are significant differences between causes of action relating to design infringement on the one hand, and those based on allegations of passing off. Defendants had argued that (i) design infringement is based on a statutory right, whereas passing off is a common law injury; (ii) the basis of the former is design of an article, for sale, whereas the latter is based on misrepresentation; (iii) Similarly, a design infringement suit alleges that the design is novel, not based on any previous publication in India, whereas the passing off suit has to establish that the shape or mark has developed substantial goodwill and reputation and adoption of a deceptively or confusingly similar design or shape by the defendant. (iv) The defenses, likewise, are entirely different, submitted counsel : whereas in design infringement suit, cancellation based on lack of novelty or existence of previous publication can be the basis of defenses, the lack of any distinctiveness (of the plaintiff's mark or design), prior user, bona fide use, or lack of plaintiff's goodwill are defenses in the passing off suit. (v) Lastly it was stated that although the court of competent jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Designs Act is identical to that in passing off, as soon as a defense of cancellation is claimed by the defendant in a design infringement suit, it has to be transferred to the High Court under Section 22(2) of the Designs Act.”",

                        "content": "Dealing with the aforesaid contentions, theFJB made the following observations:- “44. A registered design owner, this court notices, facially satisfies the test of novelty (of the product's design) and that it was not previously published. For registration,the article must contain uniqueness or novelty in regard to elements such as  shape, configuration,pattern, ornament or composition of lines of colours applied to any article; further there must be a visual appeal to the article (i.e. the aesthetic appeal). However, if the defendant establishes that indeed there was no novelty, or that a similar design had been published earlier, in the public domain, the infringement claim would be repelled. In respect of a passing of claim, distinctiveness of the elements of the mark, its visual or other presentation and its association with the trader or owner needs to be established. The factual overlap here is with respect to the presentation -in the design, it is the novelty and aesthetic presentation;in a passing off action, it is the distinctiveness (of the mark) with the attendant association with the owner. To establish infringement (of a design) fraudulent imitation of the article (by the defendant) has to be proved. Likewise, to show passing off, it is necessary for the owner of the mark to establish that the defendant has misrepresented to the public (irrespective of intent) that its goods are that of the plaintiff's; the resultant harm to the plaintiff's reputation is an actionable claim.”",

According to the FJB, this observation ignores the Designs Act, wherein Section 19(e) specifically exposes a registered design to cancellation, when it is not a design as defined under Section 2(d). It was held that if a registered design per se is used as a trademark, it apparently can be cancelled. What is, however, of significance for the present case, is the observation that the legal formulation  in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action, i.e., one which is not limited or restricted to trademarkuse alone, but the overall get-up or trade dress, however, is correct. Para 45 of the judgment is as under:- “45. This court is also of the opinion that the Full Bench ruling in Mohan Lal (supra) made an observation, which is inaccurate : it firstly correctly noted that registration as a design is not possible, of a trade mark; it, however later noted that “post registration under Section 11 of the Designs Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the registrant of the design. The reason being : the use of a registered design as a trade mark, is not provided as a ground for its cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.” This observation ignores that the Designs Act, Section 19(e) specifically exposes a registered design to cancellation when “(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.” The reason for this is that Section 2 of the Designs Act, defines “design” as “…the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article…….; but does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958…..” Therefore, if the registered design per se is used as a trade mark, it apparently can be cancelled. The larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action i.e one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or “trade dress” however, is correct; as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the product through its packaging and so on, given that a “passing off” claim can include but is also broader than infringement of a trademark, the cause of action against such use lies.”",

With regard to Issue numberII before the FB in Mohan Lal (supra), the Division Bench observed as under:- “22. Secondly, the sentence in para 43 of the judgment of Bhat, J. that “the larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or trade dress however, is correct” appears prima facie to place the issue beyond doubt that the FJB in Carlsberg upheld the view of the majority of the FB in Mohan Lal that a passing off action was indeed maintainable in respect of a registered design used as a trademark. To this Court is appears prima facie on a reading of the above para 43, together with the preceding and succeeding para, as a whole that the only qualification in Carlsberg was that if such registered design was used as a trademark then it can lead to the cancellation of the registration of such design. The words “as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the products through its packaging and so on” has to be seen in the context of the discussion preceding it which turns on what can be registered as a design and what cannot. Importantly,the FJB does not explicitly or impliedly overrule the FB in Mohan Lal as regards the answer to Issue II and rightly so since the FJB in Carlsberg was concerned only with Issue HI (whether a composite suit for design infringement and passing off was maintainable).",

The reasoning given by the FJB for this conclusion is simple. Definition of Design in Section 2(d) of the Act excludes any‘trademark’ as defined in Section 2(1)(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. However, going further, the FJB has clearly held that thelarger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra) that a passing off action i.e., one which is not limited or restrictedto trademark use alone, but the overall get-up, trade-dressetc., is correct. It was further held that as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get-up, presentation through its packaging etc. given that passing off claim can include and is also broader than infringement of a trademark, cause of action against such use lies. Seen in this light, learned Senior Counselfor DefendantNo.1 is not correct in arguing that a claim of passing off and infringement of a registered design cannot be raised simultaneously and thepleas are self-destructive.

According to Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading business or any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off will then lie wherever the defendant companys name, or its intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the proceedings.

In other words, publication before registration defeats the proprietors right to protection. In this context, I may only refer to paras 20 and 24 from thejudgment of theCalcutta High Court in Atul Narsibhai  “20. The principle that emerges from the judicial decisions as well as from the authorities on the subject is that, in the event, it is found that the impugned design has substantial identity with the prior published design, it is liable to be cancelled. In order to claim novelty, there has to be a significant change or difference in the design, although, it may have a common source. A mere trade variant without significant and substantial noticeable features would destroy novelty. A drawing or publication of a design in any form must suggest explicitly or implicitly by context that the pattern or picture should be applied to an article.  xxx  xxx xxx 24. In Saunders v. Wiel reported in Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark, Vol. X, No. 4, Page 29, it was held that new or original design not previously published did not require novelty in the idea of the design but novelty in the application of the design to some article of manufacturer.

It is submitted that what has to be considered is the creative manner in which the inspiration is used and the manner in which such designs are applied to the products. In order to create an aesthetic design, the creative team of the plaintiff company travels to different parts of the world to understand the various aspects of the theme, creates the mood board and then works on the design.

The law has been crystallized in a catena of judgments wherein the Courts have held that in relation designs, expression “original” includes designs which though old in themselves but were new in their application.  (a)  In Gammeter v. Controller of Patents and Designs (1918) ILR 45 Cal 606, the Court had held that the test that has to be applied to see whether a design is new or original or not is that the design must be new or original with reference to the kind of article to which it is applied. In the said case, the novelty band used by the plaintiff was held to be new and original even though the said band was similar to the bracelet produced by the defendants as the Court was of the view that the purpose and use of the band was entirely different from the purpose and use of the bracelet. It was further observed that the  said band had never been previously applied to wrist watches and the fact that it had an immediate and lucrative sale strongly indicates that the article sold was useful novelty. It was further observed that applying an old design to a new use must be protected. (Relevant paras 10, 11, 16 17).  (b)  In Gopal Glass Works v. Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs (2007) 1 Cal LT 290 (HC), the Court had observed that in order to destroy the novelty of a design registration whether by publication or use or any other way, must be of the pattern, shape and/or configuration applied to the same article. It was further observed that when the novelty of an article is tested against the prior published document, the main factor required to be judged is the visual effect and appeal of the picture illustration. Further, the Court held that such visual effect and appeal of the pattern and/or configuration must be considered in respect of the article to which it is applied. (Relevant paras 32 to 38 and 45 to 47).  (c)  In Bharat Glass Tube Limited v. Gopal Glass Works Limited AIR 2008 SC 2520, the Supreme Court had observed that the expression ‘new or original’ in the context of designs has to be construed that whether the said design has ever been produced by any third party on that particular article or not. It was held that in the registration of a design two things are required to be considered together i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article. (Relevant Paras 6, 8, 10, 13, 14).  (d)  In Asian Rubber Industries v. Jasco Rubber 2013 (1) Bom CR 393, Paras 3, 13, 14, 15 & 19, the defendants had challenged the validity of the design of the plaintiff on the ground that the said design of the footwear registered by the plaintiff was not new or original as the said design was developed from ‘Padukas’ which design has been commonly available since centuries. In the said case, the Court was of the view that the plaintiff is not claiming to be the inventor of ‘Padukas’ and is not claiming exclusivity by way of a patent right. However, the plaintiff is claiming exclusivity in the ‘Creative Expression’ and the ‘Look and Feel’ of their  products. It was further observed that in the recent past, it is not known that the said look and feel of Padukas with the modification of strap to support the foot has been applied by any person to footwear. Thus, application of design of Padukas -of its ‘Look and Feel’, to footwear by the plaintiff in the recent past certainly falls within the meaning of ‘Original’ as defined in the Act and includes the cases which the old and themselves yet are new in their application (Relevant paras 3, 13, 14, 15, 19).  (e)  In Shiv Prasad Ram Dayal v. Shyamlal Bhagirath 1962 Cri LJ 551, the question that arose before the Court is that whether the general ‘get-up’ of the Katta of Bidis of the accused is a colorable imitation of the Katta of the complainant. The relevant portion of the said judgment is provided hereunder:  “In the instant case we have both the kattas of bidis before us and can decide for ourselves whether the general ‘get-up’ of the katta of the accused is a colourable imitation of the ‘Katta’ of the complainant. What is compendiously called the ‘get-up’, is the general size, shape and dress in which the goods are presented to the buyer. Size and shape are common to the trade as the Bidi kattas are usually packed in like size and shape. It is the dress the material, color and decoration of the wrapper, the motif of the trade mark label and its colour combination, the lettering and their arrangements which gives to the goods their individuality.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

The defendants have failed to assign any explanation as to why they have adopted and used the product in similar  designs for commercial purposes and in relation to the same business. Therefore, the interim order pertaining to the same is made absolute by disposing of both interim applications. As the products used by the defendants in relation to the design of Lotus and Bali Mynah is concerned, the design of the product are dissimilar substantially, the ex-parte order is accordingly vacated pertaining to them. However, the defendant is restrained from using the titles Bali Mynah and Rose Princess in relation to the similar business as that of the plaintiff. However, they are entitled to use the said titles in respect of different activities and unconnected field of activities. With regard to Periyar design, the use of the same is given by the defendants during the course of arguments.”",

In answering thequestion whether the Plaintiff has made out a case for passing off, the only inquiry which needsto be addressed is whether the purchaser is likely to be misled into believing that he was purchasing Plaintiff’s product. It is the case of the Plaintiff that with the collective effort of their creative team, a unique andaesthetic design has been created and applied to the ENTICER ART-NS Stone fans. The ENTICER ART fans were conceived as an opportunity to provide Indian customersdetailed and high-end patterns on the ceiling fans, to complement most Indian home interiors and provide the richness and eliteness. The idea behind the creativity was to enhance the 5th wall, i.e. ceiling bearing the fans. Inspiration behind the unique series was from nature and, therefore, patterns such as flowers, foliage, marble etc. were used.",

This question has been considered in several judicial pronouncements. The leading decisions on the point are the decisions in the case of Castrol India Limited v. Tide Water Oil Co.(I) Limited and Kemp & Co. v. Prima Plastics Limited. In both the decisions, the Kolkata High Court and the Bombay High Court have laid down the following propositions as constituting the test to decide whether there is obvious imitation and/or piracy of a registered design.  (i)  The word ‘imitation’ does not mean ‘duplication’ in the sense that the copy complained of need not be an exact replica.  (ii)  The Court is required to see in particular as to whether the essential part or the basis of the Plaintiff's claim for novelty forms part of the infringing copy.  (iii)  The similarity or difference is to be judged through the eye alone and where the article in respect of which the design is applied is itself the object of purchase, through the eye of the purchaser.  (iv)  The Court must address its mind as to whether the design adopted by the Defendant was substantially different from the design which was registered. The Court ought to consider the rival designs as a whole to see whether the impugned design is substantially different from the design sought to be enforced. (The test laid down on Benchchairs Ltd. C. Chair Center Ltd. was cited with approval).  (v)  ‘Obvious’ means something which, as soon as one looks at it, strikes one as being so like the original design/the registered design, as to be almost unmistakable. Fraudulent  imitation is an imitation which is based upon, and deliberately based upon, the registered design and is an imitation which may be less apparent than obvious imitation, that is to say, one may have a more subtle distinction between the registered design and a fraudulent imitation and yet the fraudulent imitation, although it is different in some respects from the original, and in respects which render it not obviously an imitation may yet be an imitation perceptible when the two designs are closely scanned and accordingly amounts to infringement. (The test laid down in Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Golf Ball Developments Ltd. was cited with approval. Kemp & Co. v. Prima Plastics Limited: (supra)  (i)  If the visual features of shape, configuration pattern designs are similar or strikingly similar to the eye, it is not necessary that the two designs must be exactly identical and same. The matter must be looked at as one of substance and essential features of the designs ought to be considered.  (ii)  In a given case, where the registered design is made up of a pattern which has no one striking feature in it, but it appeals to the eye as a whole, it may very well be that another design may be an imitation of it which makes the same appeal to the eye notwithstanding that there are many differences in the details. (The opinion of Farwell J. in Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Golf Ball Developments Ltd. was cited with approval).  (iii)  In comparing rival designs the Court is required to see whether the impugned design/product is substantially different to the design which is sought to be enforced.",

As per the said affidavit, for various reasons including for enhancing supply of local manufactured products and for self-sufficiency purposes in the case of medicines, drug and medical devices, certain guidelines were issued by the Government classifying Local Suppliers based on local value addition or local content as Class I Local Supplier having local content of more than 80%, Class II Local Supplier having local content of 50-80%, and Non-Local Supplier having local content less than 50%. Thereafter, it is stated that the Ministry of Railways and other procuring agencies had requested for relaxation of the same due to non-availability of local producers. At that stage, a need was felt for ascertaining local manufacturers in respect of various drugs. In this background, a list of 209 drugs was published on the website of the DOP, vide public notice dated 28th February, 2022, seeking details of the local manufacturers available for these drugs. In response to the said notice, the Defendant addressed an email dated 15th March, 2022 to the DOP giving details of its manufacturing capabilities in respect of 44 drugs.",

The defendant has misinterpreted the Public Notice as if DoP is going to procure the drugs by issuing any authorization which is altogether a different power vested with the DPIIT and issued sparingly under any public health emergency.  xxxx 17. That, as to the issue of patent here, it is clarified that the Department's Public Notice dated 28.02.2022 nowhere directs or compels anyone to infringe upon the rights of the patent holders.
