It was stated that DC DERMACOL was the product of an international brand (Czech Brand) and DC DERMACOL had gained high repute as a brand all over the world in respect of skin makeup. DC DERMACOL had authorized the Sanash Impex Pvt. Ltd. and had granted it absolute and exclusive right to sell DC DERMACOL cosmetic products in India, both online and off-line. However, fake products were being sold through Flipkart and Amazon India. It was alleged in the complaint that this was in connivance with the fake/unauthorized re-sellers. Thus, the respondent No.2/Mr.Ashish Girdhar, on behalf of its company, accused the petitioner of cheating and illegal selling of products of DC DERMACOL cosmetics. On the basis of this complaint, FIR No.103/2020 was registered for the commission of offences under Sections 103/104 of the T.M. Act and Section 63 of the Copyright Act.",

T. Guidelines, once “actual information” had been sent to the petitioner, they had to take down the offending sites through which fake products were being sold. It was pointed out that out of the ten sites about which the complainant had given information, the petitioner had in fact taken down four of them, without any court order, and there was no logic in their insistence on a court order qua the other six sites. Thus, it was urged that the petitioner could not act whimsically. Attention of this Court was drawn to Rule  3(2)(d) and Rule 3(4) of the I.T. Guidelines to submit that when 33 emails had been sent by the respondent No.2 to the petitioner, “actual knowledge” had been acquired by the petitioner and when they did not choose to remedy the situation, there was no adherence to “due diligence”. Therefore too, there was no immunity that could be claimed by the petitioner. It was further submitted, placing reliance on Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, 2021 SCC OnLine SC 315, that investigations could not be stopped, as has been sought in the present case, and therefore, the petition deserved to be dismissed. It was further submitted that nor could the F.I.R. be quashed also because it did not meet the criterion of being the „rarest of the rare cases‟, when alone the court would exercise powers to quash the FIR and that too, at a nascent stage.

Thus protection was available under Section 79(2) if the intermediary did certain acts while protection would be withdrawn under Section 79(3) if the intermediaries committed certain other acts.

While considering the question of issuance of interim injunctions against intermediaries, the courts have discussed at length the availability of “safe harbour” protection provided under Section 79 of the I.T. Act. The need to discuss those judgments at length here is not felt.  The present matter relates to criminal liability. The simple question is whether compliance with the “due diligence” requirement under Rule 3 of the I.T. Guidelines would render the intermediary eligible for exemption from criminal liability also.",

For instance, to establish criminal liability for negligence, the standard of proof is set much higher than for „civil liability‟ under the law of Torts for negligence. There is no reason why that higher standard should not be available to courts to determine whether an intermediary would be liable under the criminal law for action or inaction. It would also stand to reason that when the intermediaries have been granted the ―safe harbour‖ qua civil liability, and when a higher standard of culpability is required for a criminal prosecution, such “safe harbour” should be available even in respect of criminal prosecution. Thus, unless an active role is disclosed in the commission of the offences complained of, the intermediary, such as the present petitioner, would be entitled to claim protection under Section 79 of the I.T. Act. In other words, the question must be answered in the affirmative that when compliance with the “due diligence” requirement under Rule 3 of the I.T. Guidelines is evident, ex facie, the exclusion of liability under Section 79 of the I.T. Act would include exclusion from criminal prosecution.",

Guidelines can be derived on the complaint submitted by a party, without a court order, would be problematic. The claim to a trade mark or copyright is often a stoutly contested affair even before a civil court. The intermediaries are certainly not situated to determine the correctness of a claim by a complainant to a trade mark or copyright. For instance, it could be a violater/infringer, who may complain to the intermediary against the registered owner of a trade mark or copyright to prevent use by such registered owner. If such a complaint, per se, was sufficient to take down the infringing material, etc., the havoc that can be caused to  e-commerce is beyond imagination.",

It is also stated that the defendant Nos. 14 and 18 have already left the employment of the defendant No. 1 and rejoined the services of the plaintiff. It is also contended that defendant No. 7 has worked with the plaintiff company for only 19 days, defendant No. 13 has worked only for 9 months and defendant No. 15 has worked only for 4 months. Defendant No. 17 never joined defendant company at all. Therefore, the contention of the plaintiff that all these employees were key performers of the plaintiff and had access to confidential information is false. She has alleged that this misrepresentation and concealment has been done to project before this Court that a number of employees have left the plaintiff and joined the defendant company so as to artificially balloon the magnitude of the alleged injury.",

Clause 11 of the NDA seeks to impose a restriction upon the defendant Nos. 2-20 to seek further employment in the future. It is her submission that therefore, this clause should be held as void.

Her contention is that information which is available in the public domain and cannot be termed as copyright, confidential information or a trade secret. Moreover, if a party wants to claim that it has copyright over its data, then it must show who the author of the work is.

(ii)  The restraint order is causing irreparable loss and damage to the defendant company.  (iii)  The NDA which the plaintiff is using as a basis for its case has not been signed by majority of the defendants including defendant Nos.5, 7, 12, 13 and 15.  (iv)  The defendant Nos. 14 and 18 are serving with the plaintiff.  (v)  Even the defendant No.6, 16, 17 and 19 have not signed the NDA and as such are not bound by it.  (vi)  The defendant No.3 has resigned from plaintiff company on January 29, 2021 and had joined the defendant company on February 8, 2022. The employee is restricted only for a period of one year, which period had since expired.  (vii)  In view of Section 27 of the Contract Act, agreements in restraint of trade are void and such a restriction is apparent in this case, as is clear from clause 11 of the NDA which imposes a restriction upon the defendants who have signed the NDA to seek further employment in future.  (viii)  As the plaintiff has processed all the exit formalities of the defendants they had no legal liability to adhere to the non- compete clause of the NDA.  (ix)  No information or material has been placed on record to show what particular information provided by the plaintiff was classified as confidential which has been misused by the defendants who have signed the NDA.  (x)  Information regarding customer base is not confidential information as has been claimed by the plaintiff company.  (xi)  Information which is available in public domain cannot be termed as confidential / copyright or trade secret.  (xii)  The allegation that the defendant company has poached the clients of the plaintiff is denied as in Gold Loan Sourcing business all information regarding clients is retained by the bank and not by the DSA, i.e., the plaintiff company.  (xiii)  Even the information regarding gold rate, percentage of loan against mortgaged gold and percentage commission is not permitted to be retained by the DSA. In other words, Gold Loan Sourcing does not involve creation of any confidential information.  (xiv)  The reliance on the audited balance sheet is completely misplaced as those accounts pertain to the year 2019-2020 which is much before the defendant company started its operation in 2021-2022, and the same contains data of multiple businesses of the plaintiff.  (xv)  The plaintiff was already witnessing a downward trend in its business much before the incorporation of the defendant company.",

Naveen Jain, 2005 SCC OnLine Del 367, Stellar Information Technology Private Ltd. (supra) and American Express Bank Ltd. (supra) held as under:  “41. On facts as pleaded in plaint it appeared that there can be no confidentiality about such a list. Just like customers/clients of an Advocate practicing in the field of acquisition of land and determination of compensation therefor can comprise only of those whose land has been acquired and whose particulars are contained in the acquisition notification and/or award pronounced by the Land Acquisition Collector, similarly the list of customers/clients of the plaintiff, carrying on business in the field of logistic and freight forwarding, can only comprise of businesses/industry requiring carriage of goods and material and none else. Names and contact addresses of such businesses are easily available in public domain. Any competitor of the plaintiff worth its salt would also know of such businesses/industry and be free to market his services to them, even if presently employing the service of the plaintiff. I am thus unable to fathom the confidentiality therein and during the hearing also repeatedly enquired about the same and also enquired about the particulars of other works/databases and in which also copyright and confidentiality was claimed. No answer was forthcoming. Every customer list cannot  qualify as confidential information or a trade secret unless the confidentiality around such a list is of economic value/business value/commercial value. A thought also crossed my mind, whether not any employee of the plaintiff, dealing with the customers/clients of the plaintiff on behalf of the plaintiff, would have knowledge of the said customers/clients and their contact address even in the absence of a list and how could such an employee, when joining the employment of a competitor, be prevented from marketing the services of the competitor to the employees/clients at the address on which he was earlier servicing them under employment of the former employer and whether not it would amount to restraint of trade.",

It was yet further held that if such items are called as trade secrets, or secret, would lose its meaning and significance.

Similarly it was held that fixation of rates etc. depends on a number of factors including the popularity, in that case of T.V. serial and the time-slots of the display of such T.V. serials and mere use of the words „strategies‟, „policy decisions‟ or „crucial policies‟ repeatedly in all the items does not acquire the position or character of secrecy.

It was reasoned, that if the competitor bank without acquiring any information as to with whom a particular person or company is banking, can approach him and canvass about themselves, even after acquiring information that a particular person of company is banking with a bank is still entitled to approach him and canvass about themselves and it is for the customers to decide with which bank to bank.

Unless there is some material on record to show that the defendant had come to know of any confidential information / trade secret concerning the plaintiff and its business, no injunction can be granted, more so when such trade secret / confidential information have not even been spelt out. The learned Single Judge, referring to the decision in American Express Bank (supra) has observed that a competitor even after knowing which particular entity/an individual/person is currently in business with, can approach such individual/person to canvas about itself, and it is for the customer to decide which business/entity to choose. Creating a database of clients/customers and then claiming confidentiality on it does not create a monopoly over such customers.

In any case, such a stipulation in the NDA which restricts the post employment opportunities shall be barred by Section 27 of the Act as held in Percept D’Mark (India) Pvt. Ltd. (supra) wherein the Supreme Court refused to enforce such post employment restriction on the ground that the same is barred by Section 27 of the Act. The said Clause attempts to restrict activities with any existing client relationship or potential client relationship or to attempt to solicit, divert, or take away, any client prospect / client of the plaintiff. So, in effect, the clause puts a restriction on some of the defendants to carry out the activities referred to above. Such a stipulation is void.",

I find it incongruous that the law, on the one hand would disable a plaintiff from enforcing a contract where the defendant had voluntarily agreed not to do something, by going to the extent of declaring such contract void, but on the other hand, enable the same plaintiff to the same relief under the law of tort.

Any new entrant in the market, to be able to create a niche for itself, in spite of the existing players, has to compete with the existing players, by approaching the same customers and the same cache of employees who over the years have acquired expertise in that particular field. When launching the same product/service, the new entrant to the business cannot  possibly create a new set of customers for that product or service. Thus, the consumers to be approached by the new entrant would be the same who were earlier having contractual relationships with the existing players. Similarly, a new entrant cannot possibly compete if does not have the requisite expertise/finesse, required for launching a particular product or service and to be able to provide the same class or quality of service, has to necessarily have with it, hands which have been making the subject product and/or providing the said service in the past, may be under contract with the existing players. In my view, it is practically impossible to draw a line between such persons, on their own approaching the new entrant, and the new entrant approaching them.

It was unanimously held that considerations against restrictive covenants are different in cases where the restriction is to apply during the period after the termination of the contract, than those in cases where it is to operate during the period of contract of employment. In the facts of that case, it was found that the employee was privy to the special process invented/adopted by the plaintiff and of which the employee was trained and had acquired knowledge. The employee who had left employment prior to the contracted period was thus restrained from joining employment of a competitor for the remaining period for which he had contracted with the plaintiff in that case.”  It is clear from the above that this Court held it was in the facts of that case that the Supreme Court restrained the employees who were trained and acquired knowledge be restrained from joining the competitors.

D.B.

Accordingly, it was held that copy edited judgments would not satisfy the copyright merely by establishing amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy edited judgments as the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity are completely excluded. Notice in Tech Plus Media Private Ltd. was also taken of Emergent Genetics India Pvt. Ltd. v. Shailendra Shivam, 2011 (47) PTC 494.

It was held that no copyright subsists therein in the absence of employment of any skill judgment and labour in compilation thereof. It was further held that without specifically averring as to the manner/technique/criteria employed in such sequencing/collection and the originality in the same, the plaintiff could not succeed in its claim. It was yet further held that the compilation in that case was a derivative work in the sense of being a collection of sequencing of already existing information and did not satisfy the standard of creativity required to qualify as a work in which copyright subsists. It was explained that the standard of creativity required in such derivative work is higher than the standard required in cases of primary works.

This plea is not at all appealing. There is nothing on record to show that the defendants have approached the plaintiff‟s customers or they are using any propriety information of the plaintiff.

The aforesaid Offer was made in terms of Article 12.4 of the SPSA bearing the title „Right of First Refusal‟.  (ii)  The aforesaid Offer was accepted by the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company vide the Response Notice dated 6th December, 2018 as per Article 12.4(c) of the SPSA, which was made note of by defendant No.1 vide the Communication dated 14th December, 2018, whereby the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company were asked to pay the sum of Rs.9,77,210/-as consideration value of the shares.   (iii)  The transfer of the shares from the defendant No.1 to the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company was to be completed within thirty business days from the date of the Response Notice.  (iv)  However, the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company failed to transmit the consideration in respect of the transfer and in this regard, a Default Notice dated 25th January, 2019 was issued by the defendant No.1, being the Non-Defaulting Party, to the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company, being the Defaulting Parties, whereby the Defaulting Parties were requested to cure the Event of Default within thirty business days from the receipt of the said Default Notice.  (v)  The plaintiff Company, thereafter, sent a Legal Notice to the defendant No.1 dated 15th February, 2019, alleging commission of “serious offences, breach and theft” and which allegations were denied by the defendant No.1 vide Reply dated 28th February, 2019. A Rejoinder dated 25th March, 2019 thereto on behalf of the plaintiff Company was sent to the defendant No.1.  (vi)  Another Default Notice dated 7th March, 2019 was issued by defendant No.1 to the plaintiff Company in terms of Article 14.3 a. of  the SPSA. It was stated therein since the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company had failed to pay the consideration for the transfer of the shares of the defendant No.1, and which Event of Default had remained uncured, there was a default committed on behalf of the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company. In view of the aforesaid, in terms of Article 14.3 a. ii) of the SPSA, the SPSA was liable to be terminated and in such circumstance, under Article 14.3 a. ii) of the SPSA, the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company were obligated to purchase all of the shares held by the Non-Defaulting Party, the defendant No. 1, at a price equal to 125% of the „Fair Market Value‟ provided by the defendant No. 1, consequent to the process under Article 14.3 d. of the SPSA.  (vii)  Accordingly, vide the aforesaid Notice the defendant No.1 terminated the SPSA and proceeded to take steps for fixation of the „Fair Market Value‟ of the shares in terms of Article 14.3 d. of the SPSA.  (viii)  Vide Reply dated 20th March, 2019 by the plaintiff No.1 Company, it was stated that the Article 14.2, being „Events of Default‟ and Article 14.3, being „Consequences of Event of Default‟ were very specific to the „Parties‟ of the SPSA as defined in the SPSA and not to the individual Members of the Tech Group. Therefore, Articles 14.2 and 14.3 were only applicable in case there is an Event of Default committed by a Party and were not applicable for a default that may be committed by a Member towards any other Member. Furthermore, it was stated that unless a satisfactory resolution of the allegations against the defendant No.1 was done, the Non-Selling Shareholders of  the plaintiff Company would not like to proceed with the transfer of shares as agreed by vide Response Notice dated 6th December, 2018.  (ix)  The defendant No.1 contacted the plaintiff Company vide Letter dated 5th April, 2019 to submit the documents required for the determination of „Fair Market Value‟ of the shares of the plaintiff Company, however, the plaintiff Company refused to provide such information vide Letter dated 10th April, 2019, stating that the claim of the defendant No.1 of termination of the SPSA under Article 14.3 of the SPSA was not sustainable.",

If the Tech Group is to be treated as a party to the SPSA, Defendant No.1 cannot, in my view, be individually bound by the covenants in Clause 20.1 and 22.1. If, on the other hand, Defendant No.1 is to be treated as a party to the SPSA for the purposes of Clause 20.1 and 22.1, he would equally be a party to the SPSA for the purpose of Clause 14.4. No concept of ―percolating down‖ of responsibilities and obligations under the SPSA finds any place therein. The argument, therefore, though ingenious, fails to impress.‖",

Since the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company defaulted in making payment to the defendant No.1 in pursuance to the aforesaid Offer, the aforesaid Offer price  of Rs.130/-ceased to apply. It is further to be noted that the defendant No.1 gave an opportunity to the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company to cure the Event of Default through the Default Notice dated 25th January, 2019. However, the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company failed to cure the Event of Default. Rather, vide Reply dated 20th March, 2019, the Non-Selling Shareholders of the plaintiff Company stated that they would not like to proceed with the transfer of shares as agreed by vide Response Notice dated 6th December, 2018.

What is thus for adjudication is, whether there can be any copyright in a list of customers/clients with their contact persons/numbers maintained by the service provider. Though the plaintiff has in the plaint generally pleaded database pertaining to, running of business accounts information, airway drawings, airway bills templates, plans, reports, taxes and other financial information, process, financial/administrative and/or organizational information as well as transactions based templates and internal notings and trade secrets of the plaintiff company, but the said words/phrases, though high-sounding, are vague and do not constitute a plea in law within the meaning of Order VI Rules 2, 4, 9 and Order VII Rules 1(e) and 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). In this context, it may be also mentioned that using such high-sounding/phrases which in fact have no content or meaning, a large number of suits are filed in this Court against the ex-employees and it has often been found that interim injunctions issued restraining the ex-employees from divulging the same to any other person remain unenforceable in the absence of particulars and with applications under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the CPC being filed with respect to all communications made by such employees with others and with it being absolutely impossible for the Court to determine whether the communication is in violation of the interim order. It is for this reason only that Section 41(f) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and principles whereof are applicable to temporary injunctions also, prohibits grant of injunction to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a nuisance. Similarly, without specifying the information, disclosure of which is sought to be restrained, an injunction cannot be granted; rather I have wondered the purport of the interim order dated 3rd June, 2016 in this suit, restraining the defendants from utilizing, exploiting, copying, transmitting, publishing or releasing any confidential information and trade secrets of the plaintiff to any entity  for any purpose whatsoever, without specifying as to which is that confidential information and trade secret. It is for this reason that I have hereinabove observed that what is for adjudication is, whether list of customers/clients with their contact numbers prepared/drawn up by a service provider can be said to be a work in which such service provider can have copyright.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Furthermore, in the case of Homag India Private Ltd. (supra), in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court of Karnataka granted an order of temporary injunction with reference to specific names stated in the product catalogue of the plaintiff therein for a limited period to avoid a situation of grant of an order of temporary injunction on vague terms and to avoid likelihood of the plaintiff therein misusing the order to curb the business activities of the defendant therein. Even paragraph 11 of the order of this Court in Honeywell International Pvt. Ltd. (supra), specifically notes that the large amount of confidential information, which had been transferred by the defendant therein to an external media prior to returning of the laptop to the plaintiff therein, had been contained in a tabular form from pages 39 to 62 of the documents and the defendant therein was restrained from directly or indirectly disclosing, selling or transmitting the confidential data, including the files mentioned at pages 39 to 62 of the documents to a third party. Thus, in the said aforesaid case, the Court had been privy to the confidential information in respect of which the injunction was sought.

Disputes aggravated, leading the parties herein to execute a Termination Agreement dated 10th April 2021, inter-alia agreeing for settlement of outstanding payments/dues, as per books of accounts of both parties. Post termination, Defendant No. 1, set up its own LA MILANO pizzeria, in/around the same premises where it was earlier operating as a franchisee, which has given rise to the present dispute.

Mr. Mehta has vehemently stressed that the suit is not for tort or unfair competition, but for infringement and passing off, and therefore the Plaintiffs should not be permitted to seek reliefs which are beyond the scope of the suit. Nevertheless, even while strongly controverting the allegation in the suit, Mr. Mehta has very fairly, without prejudice to his rights and contentions, willingly agreed to abide by certain undertakings in order to resolve the controversy. In light of the reasonable stand taken by Mr. Mehta, the controversial points are considerably narrowed down, and there is no need to adjudicate each and every contention urged in the brief note as well as in the application. Hence, this order shall determine the interim arrangement that shall continue during the pendency of the suit and resolve any confusion or affiliation between the two brands that may be lingering. There is no dispute that after the cessation of the Master Franchisee Agreement, Defendant No. 1 has commenced the same business of pizzeria chains, and some of its outlets are operating from the same location which earlier functioned under the Plaintiffs’ brand name. Therefore, it would best serve the interest of both the parties that they distance themselves from each other to have their own identities so as not to cause any confusion to the general public. To that extent, Mr. Mehta has explicitly stressed that Defendant No. 1 has neither claimed nor has any intention to claim or exhibit any association with the Plaintiffs. The Defendant has, without prejudice, undertaken to abide by the following actions:  A.  To deactivate its Facebook5 and Instagram6 pages;  B.  To not use the sachets of chili flakes and oregano seasonings bearing the mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA;  C.  To neither use nor shall use, the mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA on pizza delivery bags;  D.  To neither use nor shall use, (lapinozahmedabad@gmail.com) or any other email ID containing the mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA;  E.  To neither use nor shall use, the mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA as Unified Payments Interface (UPI) IDs;  F.  To not disparage the Plaintiffs and their brand, inter alia, in any public communications.",

Lall, the Plaintiffs adopted the brand name LA PINO’Z PIZZA in July-August, 2013 and registered the trademark and the logo on 23rd August, 2013. The registrations are valid and subsisting. Plaintiff No. 2 licensed use of the said trade marks to Plaintiff No. 1, who has been using the word mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA and the logo since then in over 175 outlets all over the country. By virtue of such extensive use and publicity, he states that the trade mark LA PINO’Z PIZZA and logo have gained immense recognition, valuable goodwill and reputation amongst members of  public and trade, and the said trade marks have become distinctive and are exclusively identified by the general public and trade with Plaintiffs’ goods and services. Mr. Lal avers that the Defendants seek to ride upon the goodwill and reputation of LA PINO’Z PIZZA and have attempted to mischievously copy all the Plaintiffs’ marks in a complete dishonest adoption. He argues that the two-word marks, when compared, show a likelihood of confusion in the eyes of the general public, due to the following similarities:  (i)  The Defendants have deliberately copied the prefix “LA” to its mark, with dishonest intention.  (ii)  A rhyming or phonetic similarity between the two marks, due to use of the letters I, N and O appearing in both the marks, is also likely to cause confusion.  (iii)  The act of Defendant No. 1 of adopting the impugned mark LA MILANO PIZZERIA and domain name/website <lamilanopizza.in>, for its business, which is phonetically and conceptually similar, having the same phonetic starting syllabi ‘LA’ and end syllabi ‘-NO’ in LA PINO’Z and LA MILANO, and ending the mark with the generic word ‘PIZZA’, shows the dishonest intention of the Defendant No. 1.  (iv)  The shape and colour combination of the logo as adopted by the Defendant No. 1 is identical to that of the Plaintiffs’. The Defendant No. 1 has made all attempts to copy the Plaintiffs’ brand logo, while making little changes, so as to save its position in an infringement action.",

                        "content": "In the considered opinion of the Court, the two word-marks and device-marks are completely different and the Court does not find any deceptive similarity in the same. The law on deceptive similarity requires no introduction. 8 The Apex Court has laid down the test of ‘point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection’, to whom, the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the two names is likely to deceive or  cause confusion.9 However, while considering the overall similarity of composite words, the two marks are to be considered as a whole, and due regard is to be placed on the circumstances.10 Hence, each case turns on its own facts. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of difference. It is to be seen whether an imprudent purchaser (of average intelligence and imperfect recollection) would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names, having regard to the nature of the product.11 In fact, mere ocular comparison is not always the decisive test, and the Apex Court has also quoted the High Court of Bombay on the point of deceptive similarity, in the following words:12  7 In the name of Mr. S. JASBIR SINGH trading as K.S. FOODS, bearing Registration. No. 2530426 dated 14/05/2013.  8 In Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, the Apex Court laid down the following factors for deciding the question of deceptive similarity: (a) The nature of the marks, i.e., whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks, i.e. both words and label works. (b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea. (c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks. (d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders. (e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods. (f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods. (g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.  It is settled law that a trade mark comprehends not merely the picture design or symbol but also its descriptive name. A copy of colourable imitation of the name, would constitute an infringement of the mark containing the name. Nobody can abstract the name or use a phonetical equivalent of it and escape the charge of piracy of the mark pleading that the visual aspect of his mark is different from the mark of the person opposing its registration. The words, Ambal and Andal, have such great phonetic similarity that they are undistinguishable having the same sound and pronounciation. In whatever way they are uttered or spoken, slowly or quickly perfectly or imperfectly, meticulously or carelessly and whoever utters them, a foreigner or a native of India, wherever they are uttered in the noisy market place or in a calm and secluded area, over the phone or in person, the danger of confusion between the two phonetically allied names is imminent and unavoidable.",

LA is grammatically akin to the use of article “THE” in the English language, and merely serves to emphasise the next word: “MILANO” or “PINO’Z”. LA is not an invented mark, rather, it is an expression routinely used in Spanish language. Therefore, the Plaintiff cannot claim any monopoly over the same. Besides, this grammatical commonality and adoption thereof cannot be a ground to allege deceptive similarity between the two marks.  both the logos are circular, Defendants’ mark is indicative of a crust 21. Further, the logo / device marks, too, are fairly different. Although, of a pizza with a concentric circle showing the flag of Italy. In comparison,  9 Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449.  10 Corn Products Refining Company v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., AIR 1960 SC 142.  11 Id.  12 K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Shri Ambal and Co., (1969) 2 SCC 131  Plaintiffs’ double concentric circle pizza shape has a pizza slice as well, which could also be interpreted as a chef’s hat. The fonts are different. The Plaintiffs’ mark also has a slogan “Italian Taste Indian Palate”. Indeed, colour scheme of both is borrowed from the tricolour of Italian flag, but the similarity ends there. In fact, as pointed out by Mr. Mehta, it is quite common for logos in the pizza category to have a pizza crust-like circle and the colours of the Italian flag – which are indicative of dish’s origin. In these circumstances, the Court does not find any ground to pass a restraining order in terms of points (i) and (ii), and consequently, prayer (a) made in the application is rejected.",

Mr. Lall underscored that the instant case raises an important issue concerning franchise operations, because a franchisor, after years of labour and hard work, develops a franchise model and franchise operations, to extend its business outreach. For this purpose, it appoints relative novices as franchisees and shares all its know-how and expertise; establishes its relationship and strives to maintain a level of quality assurance to the consumer.

Registration confers on the proprietor an exclusive right to use the trademark. Defendants have raised the defence of Plaintiffs’ registrations being invalid and also that the trade marks in question, being used by third-parties, are common to trade. At this interim stage, the plea of rebuttable presumption raised by the Defendant, relying upon Section 28 of the Act, is not such that the court can ex-facie hold in favour of the Defendant. The arguments of the Defendant at the interlocutory stage do not cross the threshold that would be necessary to deny protection to Plaintiff on the basis  of its subsisting registration. Further, a brand–owner is not duty–bound to initiate or file an action against every infringer whatsoever, even if it does not impact its business. Therefore, even if a Plaintiff has not taken action against other third parties who may be using marks similar to its own, this non-action cannot be a good ground to refuse injunction. That said, the facts of the case demonstrate that the adoption of the marks by the Defendant was dishonest. Undisputedly, Defendant No. 1 was the franchisee of Plaintiff No. 1. Whilst in business, they were using the Plaintiffs’ trademarks as a licensee. They used these-marks for monetization of their business and now cannot turn around and challenge the validity of such marks. Significantly, on termination of the agreement, they adopted marks for their pizza names which are visually and phonetically, ex facie, similar to the Plaintiffs’ marks. This adoption is therefore mischievous, considering the past contractual relationship between the parties and the manner in which the Defendants have come to adopt the impugned marks. These facts establish a prima facie case. Balance of convenience also lies in favour of the Plaintiff to be entitled to an injunction restraining the Defendants from using any marks deceptively similar to Plaintiffs’ registered marks noted in the table above.",

In order to succeed in such an action, the Plaintiffs have to pass the Classical Trinity test.15 This requires the Plaintiffs to establish goodwill or reputation in the goods they supply to the general public under the mark. They have to show that the acts of the Defendant are actions in deceit, calculated to harm the Plaintiffs’ business, divert customers and piggy-back on the Plaintiffs’ reputation and goodwill. That means that the general public should recognize these marks as specifically occurring in the Plaintiffs’ goods. The Plaintiffs have to prove that the above marks have acquired distinctiveness in the eyes of the general public so as to restrain third-parties from using the said marks. However, apart from showing that such marks have been used by the Plaintiff and registration has been applied for, no material has been placed on record to form a prima facie opinion with respect to the goodwill or public  perception of such marks so that the Plaintiffs can, on the basis of a common law right of passing off, seek restrain against the Defendants. In absence of any basis to demonstrate such purported goodwill, at this stage, prima facie, the court cannot ascertain any damage to the Plaintiffs’ marks, which is another pre-requisite to the claim of passing off.  15 As laid down in Perry v. Truefitt, (1842) 6 Beav 66, that was later upheld in the landmark case of Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v. Bordan Incorporation, [1990] 1 All ER 873.

Saraogi & Ors., 10th June, 2021, CS(COMM) 187/2021, where it is noted at Footnote No. 31, that: “The Classical Trinity test postulates that in order to prove passing off, the plaintiff must prove: (1) goodwill or reputation attached to his goods or service; (2) existence of misrepresentation by defendant to the public which is likely to lead the public to believe that the goods and services offered by defendant are that of the plaintiff; and (3) existence of loss or the likelihood of damage to plaintiff’s goodwill.”",

(iii)  The right to such injunction is not saved by Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 as no injunction, even to enforce a negative covenant in a contract which is, in its nature determinable, can be granted in a contract of personal service, if it would directly or indirectly compel the employee to idleness, or to serve the employer against her, or his, will.  (iv)  Clauses 11.1 and 11.2 of the letter of appointment are not applicable, as they apply only during the currency of the employment of the respondent with the petitioner. Besides, enforcement of the said clauses would amount to enforcing a contract of personal service, which is impermissible, in view of Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.

Prior to the amendment, Courts had the discretion to enforce, or not to enforce, specific performance. That discretion now stands eviscerated, with the amendment of Section 10.  Section 10, before and after amendment, reads thus:  “10. Cases in which specific performance of contract enforceable. – Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may, in the discretion of the court, be enforced –  (a)  when there exists no standard for ascertaining actual damage caused by the nonperformance of the act agreed to be done; or  (b)  when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation in money for its nonperformance would not afford adequate relief.  After amendment  The specific performance of the contract shall be enforced by the court subject to the provisions contained in subsection (2) of section 11, section 14 and section 16.”  Section 11(2) bars specific performance of a contract made by a trustee in excess of his powers or in breach of the trust.

Changes in some provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 will improve the ease of doing business, and will encourage parties to perform their contracts. Primarily, the recommendations enable any party to the contract to seek whichever remedy he chooses. Hence specific performance or injunction will be available by choice, and will no longer be exceptional or discretionary. Courts will be able to refuse these reliefs on specified grounds only. Secondly, a party to a contract must have the right to complete performance by himself or through a third party at the cost of the promisor, and to claim the amount he spends for this purpose. Hence a new relief is recommended. Thirdly, it is recommended that relief under section 6 of the Act should also be available to persons from whom those in immediate possession derive their rights. Other recommendations relate to assessment of compensation, enforcement by third parties. Amendments are therefore recommended to sections 6 (Possession), sections 10, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25 (Specific Performance), 26 and 28 (Rescission), and sections 37 and 41 (Injunctions) of the Act.",

An award of compensation is circumscribed by strict tests of foreseeability (contemplation) and mitigation. A promise may not be able to prove all losses  he has suffered by the breach, nor will such amounts claimed be awarded to him. Proving losses with certainty is difficult. A decree for compensation may not give to the promisee the equivalent of the promise that is broken.

Specific performance thus gets granted for certain types or classes of contracts.

A strong justification is made on the basis of economic analysis, which recommends breach when it is efficient. When compensation is the primary remedy and specific performance is exceptional, the promisor is able to break the contract when it is more beneficial for him than performing it. The promisee is expected to get compensated for his loss, and get into the same position as if the promise is performed. In this view, specific performance is efficient only when the promisee cannot find a substitute. This view assumes that the promisee can calculate all his losses, and that a decree for compensation will not fully compensate his losses. However, there is also ample support in terms of economic analysis for routine availability of specific performance.",

If it is a contract for transfer of movable property, the plaintiff must show circumstances that will satisfy the presumption of inadequacy, i.e. that-the goods are unique, or have special value for him, or are not an ordinary article of commerce, or are not available in the market.

This will have two benefits-first, it will ensure that specific performance is not granted in cases wherein it is impractical; second, it will make specific performance a statutory, and not an equitable remedy, based on clearly delineated grounds.”  There can be no gainsaying, in the face of these observations of the Expert Committee that the very intent of amending the Specific Relief Act, 1963 was to make specific performance of contracts, the norm and minimize exceptions thereto. Even so, Para 11.7 (ii) did recognize the inability, of courts, to enforce specific performance in cases which fell within the categories enumerated in Section 14.",

This indicates that the legislature chose, consciously and deliberately, to exclude contracts dependent on volition of parties from the categories of contracts which were incapable of specific performance. This was a clear departure from the position which existed under the erstwhile Section 14(1)(b). A contract of personal service, which is determinable on volition of either of the parties, is no longer, therefore, incapable of specific performance. The sequitur, by operation of Section 10, as amended, would be that Courts are obligated to enforce specific performance of such contracts, unless they are incapable of specific performance for any other reason envisaged by the Specific Relief Act, 1963.",

Per corollary, it was held, the settlement was not specifically enforceable by virtue of Section 14(1)(c); consequently, injunction, restraining breach of the settlement, could not be directed in view of the proscription contained in Section 41(e) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.",

IOCL terminated the Distributorship Agreement. The matter was carried, by AGS, to arbitration. The arbitrator held the termination of AGS’s distributorship, by IOCL, not to have been validly effected. As a consequence, the arbitrator held AGS to be entitled to compensation owing to breach of the contract by IOCL, till the breach was remedied by restoration of the distributorship of AGS. The quantum of compensation was worked out as, the commission that AGS would have earned on supply of gas cylinders to its customers, had its distributorship not been terminated. The arbitrator found that, in the peculiar facts of the case, which were exceptional, IOCL was liable to remedy the breach by restoration of  the distributorship. Inter alia, one of the “exceptional” facts, justifying restoration of the distributorship, was the fact that the termination of the distributorship was not in accordance with the termination clause contained in the Distributorship Agreement.

Having said so in the award itself, it is obvious that the arbitrator held the distributorship to be revokable in accordance with clauses 27 and 28 of the agreement. It is in this sense that the award describes the Distributorship Agreement as one for an indefinite period, that is, till terminated in accordance with clauses 27 and 28. The finding in the award being that the Distributorship Agreement was revokable and the same being admittedly for rendering personal service, the relevant provisions of the Specific Relief Act were automatically attracted. Sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act specifies the contracts which cannot be specifically enforced, one of which is ‘a contract which is in its nature determinable’. In the present case, it is not necessary to refer  to the other clauses of sub-section (1) of Section 14, which also may be attracted in the present case since clause (c) clearly applies on the finding read with reasons given in the award itself that the contract by its nature is determinable. This being so granting the relief of restoration of the distributorship even on the finding that the breach was committed by the appellant-Corporation is contrary to the mandate in Section 14(1) of the Specific Relief Act and there is an error of law apparent on the face of the award which is stated to be made according to ‘the law governing such cases’.

The Division Bench rejected the submission, relying on Indian Oil11 . The findings of the Division Bench in this regard read thus:  “The facts of the present case are identical to those in aforementioned decision of the Supreme Court in as much as the agreements in the instant case are also terminable by the respondent on happening of certain events. In Indian Oil Corporation’s case (supra) also agreement was terminable on happening of certain events. Question that whether termination is wrongful or not; the events have happened or not; the respondent is or is not justified in terminating the agreement are yet to be decided. There is no manner of doubt that the contracts by their nature determinable.”  It was further held, by the Division Bench, that “even in the absence of specific clause authorising and enabling either party to terminate the agreement in the event of happening of the events specified therein, from the very nature of the agreement, which is private  commercial transaction, the same could be terminated even without assigning any reason by serving a reasonable notice”. The remedy available with RBL, in the event of an illegal termination, it was found, would only be compensation for wrongful termination. RBL could not maintain a claim for specific performance of the agreements. Any injunction against specific performance of the agreements was, therefore, statutorily prohibited, as they were determinable in nature. The decision of the learned Single Judge was, therefore, upheld and the appeal was dismissed.",

M.C.D.14 was another decision, of a Division Bench of this Court, which considered the applicability of the erstwhile Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. This decision, too, was by way of an appeal against an order, of a learned Single Judge, rendered under Section 9 of the 1996 Act. The appellant Mic Electronics Ltd (“MEL”, hereinafter) had applied for an injunction against the operation of a letter, issued by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), cancelling the contract awarded to MEL for displaying advertisements at nine sites in the city of Delhi. Though other issues were raised, with which we need not concern ourselves, one of the submissions of MCD was that the contract was in its nature determinable and could not, therefore, be specifically enforced, as MEL desired. MCD contended that as MEL defaulted in payment of the licence fees, a show cause notice was issued to MEL, whereafter MCD cancelled the licence in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In paras 12 to 14 of the report, the Division Bench  upheld this submission of MCD and, consequently, dismissed MEL’s appeal, thus:  14 (2011) 1 Arb LR 418 (DB)  “12. The next question that needs to be considered is the contention of the Respondent that the contract between the parties was in its very nature determinable and consequently could not be specifically enforced by way of the present proceedings. In this behalf, it is observed that the Appellant did not pay the agreed licence fee in terms of the licence agreement. Consequently, after issuance of the show cause notice and calling for a reply from the Appellant the Respondent cancelled the licence under the terms of the agreement between the parties. Therefore, the licence stood terminated, as correctly observed by the learned Single Judge, in the impugned order, and the legality or illegality of termination would be a matter to be determined in arbitration. Further, the justification given by the Appellant for not paying the licence fee will be examined in the arbitral proceedings. The case of the Appellant that, owing to the failure of the Respondent to perform obligations under the agreement, and the latter’s refusal to decrease the number of LED screens in terms of clause 6 of the agreement, would also be considered by the Arbitral Tribunal. In this behalf, we, therefore, find considerable merit in the submission made on behalf of the Respondent that if the cancellation of the contract by the Respondent constitutes a breach of contract on their part, the Appellant would be entitled to damages. In other words, the questions whether the termination is wrongful or not or whether the Respondent was not justified in terminating the agreement, are yet to be decided. However, from the facts of the case there is no manner of doubt that the contract was by its very nature terminable, in terms of the contract between the parties themselves.",

(as he then was). The respondent Tarun Sawhney (“Tarun”, hereinafter) sought specific performance of two agreements to sell, whereunder he claimed to have paid amounts to the defendants (before the learned Single Judge). Clause 17 and Clause 20 in the two agreements, which were identical, read thus:  “If this agreement is not implemented within the twelve calendar months from the date hereof this agreement shall stand terminated and extinguished automatically without any further act of parties and vendors shall be at liberty to sell the said property to any other person after refund of earnest money, as also other lawful charges hereinafter mentioned if paid by the vendee on behalf of the vendor; the intention of the parties is that they all be resorted to the same position as at the date hereof and as if this agreement had not been executed.”  The appellant before the Division Bench contended that, by operation of this clause, the agreements between the appellant and the respondent were rendered “in their nature determinable” and could not, therefore, be specifically enforced, in view of the interdiction  contained in Section 14(1)(c) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The respondent contended, per contra, that an agreement could be regarded as “in its nature determinable”, only when it could be terminated at the option of either of the parties, and not where it contained a covenant envisaging its determination by efflux of time. As pithily observed by the Division Bench, “in plain language, the plaintiff drew a distinction between agreements being determinable at the option of the parties and not agreements being determinable by way of default”. (The word “not” appears to be a typo.) Thereafter, on the issue of the ambit of the expression “in its nature determinable”, the Division Bench observed as under, in paras 16 to 20 of the report:  “16.

Para 18, however, sought to draw a distinction in view of the facts before the Division Bench on the principle of the existence of “a fault liability and the fault effect and that no fault liability and that no fault effect”.  The Division Bench went on to observe – and, I confess, I am constrained to entirely agree with the observation – that the expression “in its nature determinable” does not throw any light on its actual scope and effect and as to whether it would embrace fault-effect determination. This finding is obviously returned in view of the peculiar manner in which the termination clause in the agreements (extracted supra) was worded.

Century Spinning & Manufacturing Co. Ltd15 . In order to appreciate the contention, it is necessary to appreciate, in the first instance, the exact controversy which arose before the Supreme Court in case. The appellant, Niranjan Shankar Golikari (“Niranjan”, hereafter) was appointed as a shift supervisor with the respondent-Company (“the Company”). Clause 17 of the contract between Niranjan and the Company read thus:  “In the event of the employee leaving, abandoning or resigning the service of the company in breach of the terms of the agreement before the expiry of the said period of five years he shall not directly or indirectly engage in or carry on of his own accord or in partnership with others the business at present being carried on by the company and he shall not serve in any capacity, whatsoever or be associated with any person, firm or company carrying on such business for the remainder of the said period and in addition pay to the  company as liquidated damages an amount equal to the salaries the employee would have received during the period of six months thereafter and shall further reimburse to the company any amount that the company may have spent on the employee’s training.”  15 AIR 1967 SC 1098  By a communication dated 7th November, 1964, Niranjan informed the Company that he had resigned w.e.f. 31st October, 1964. The Company, by its response dated 23rd October, 1964, directed Niranjan to resume work, stating that his resignation had not been accepted. Niranjan responded, informing that he had obtained another employment. The Company, thereupon, filed a suit before the Kalyan District Court, seeking an injunction restraining Niranjan from serving in any capacity whatsoever or being associated with any person, firm or company including Rajasthan Rayon, in which he claimed to have obtained employment after resigning from the services of the Company, till 15th March, 1968, being the terminus ad quem of the tenure of Niranjan with the Company. Niranjan also pleaded that Clause 17 was invalid, being violative of Section 27 of the Contract Act.",

The next question is whether the injunction in the terms in which it is framed should have been granted. There is no doubt that the courts have a wide discretion to enforce by injunction a negative covenant. Both the courts below have concurrently found that the apprehension of the respondent Company that information regarding the special processes and the special machinery imparted to and acquired by the appellant during the period of training and thereafter might be divulged was justified; that the information and knowledge disclosed to him during this period was different from the general knowledge and experience that he might have gained while in the service of the respondent Company and that it was against his disclosing the former to the rival company which required protection. It was argued however that the terms of clause 17 were too wide and that the court cannot sever the good from the bad and issue an injunction to the extent that was good. But the rule against severance applies to cases where the covenant is bad in law and it is in such cases that the court is precluded from severing the good from the bad. But there is nothing to prevent the court from granting a limited injunction to the extent that is necessary to protect the employer’s interests where the negative stipulation is not void. There is also nothing to show that if the negative covenant is enforced the appellant would be driven to idleness or would be compelled to go back to the respondent Company. It may be that if he is not permitted to get himself employed in another similar employment he might perhaps get a lesser remuneration than the one agreed to by Rajasthan Rayon. But that is no consideration against enforcing the covenant. The evidence is clear that the appellant has torn the agreement to pieces only because he was offered a higher remuneration. Obviously he cannot be heard to say that no injunction should be granted against him to enforce the negative covenant which is not opposed to public policy. The injunction issued against him is restricted as to time, the nature of employment and as to area and cannot therefore be  said to be too wide or unreasonable or unnecessary for the protection of the interests of the respondent Company.”  Mr. Baruah would submit that the decision in Niranjan Shankar Golikari15 actually supports the case of his client, rather than that of Mr. Sandeep Sethi’s. He points out that the Supreme Court proceeded on the premise that enforcement of the negative covenant against NSG would not consign him to idleness or force him to work for the Company. As against this, Mr. Baruah contends that, if the negative covenant is, in the present case, enforced against the respondent, who has already joined as an anchor with another news channel, she would either be forced to idleness or would be compelled to rejoin the petitioner. This, he submits, is entirely unconscionable in law. He points out, in this regard, that, in fact, consequent to the ad interim order passed by this Court, the respondent is, in fact, idle, as she is unable to work for the Aajtak news channel, which she has joined. That an Anchor, placed in such a situation is, in fact, consigned to idleness, points out Mr. Baruah, stands acknowledged by the judgment of a coordinate bench of this Court in Independent News Service P",

This is subject to the proviso that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him. The Court is, however, not bound to grant an injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee either to idleness or to serve the employer.

Mr. Sethi, in fact, predicated his submission on the premise that the respondent was welcome to join the petitioner, and would continue to draw the emoluments to which her employment with the petitioner entailed.

                        "content": "12  Para 14 of the report enumerates the considerations which compelled this Court to refuse the prayer for injunction, as advanced by INS. The following considerations would apply, mutatis mutandis, to the present case:  “(A) Granting any interim injunction would amount to restraining the defendant from doing what she has been doing for the last 14 years and what she is best known to do and has skill to do. Ad-interim injunction if granted for the period till 30th November, 2019, would amount to killing the goodwill acquired by the defendant in the last 14 years and which loss cannot be monetarily compensated to the defendant in the event of it being ultimately found in the suit that the plaintiff was not entitled to such injunction. The Courts (see S. Tamilselvan v. The Government of Tamil Nadu19 ,) have leaned in favour of resurrecting rather than killing what a person is best at. On the contrary, the plaintiff, in the event of ultimately succeeding, can always be compensated monetarily for the loss, if any suffered.  (B)  Thus, neither the element of irreparable injury nor the element of balance of convenience, on the anvil of which grant of interim relief is to be tested, is in favour of the plaintiff.  (C)  Though Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 empowers the Court to grant an injunction to perform a negative agreement and the defendant in the present case did agree with the plaintiff to, till the expiry of the term of her agreement with the plaintiff, not be associated with any other news channel, but this by no means entitles the plaintiff as a matter of right to an injunction. Grant of injunction remains discretionary and which discretion is to be exercised on the well established anvils of prima facie case, irreparable injury, balance of convenience and public interest.  *****  (G)  Granting any such ad interim injunction would lead the defendant to idleness and exception in which regard has been consistently made by the Courts including in all the cited judgments. The defendant cannot be asked to engage herself in other, behind the scene activities as is suggested, even if besides being in front of the camera for the last 14 years has also been incidentally involved in behind the scene activities. The averments in the plaint itself are guided by the acumen,  training and skill of the defendant in front of rather than behind the camera.  19 2016 SCC OnLine Mad 5960 (DB)  (H)  Benching a professional for as long as 10 to 11 months can be devastating, capable of inflicting permanent damage affecting mental and physical health and future prospects of a professional. This is more so in the case of Newscasters/News Presenter to whom the adage “out of sight out of mind” would also apply. The patrons of the defendant in the said 10 months are likely to turn over to other Newscasters/News Presenter to whom they would get habituated and not only is it doubtful that the defendant, after 10-11 months, will retain the same advantage owing whereto the plaintiff wants to restrain the defendant but it is also highly unlikely that the defendant will be able to win back the patrons so lost by her.  (I)  The entire claim of the plaintiff is on the premise of the agreement of the plaintiff with the defendant being in force. It is not as if the defendant, while continuing with the employment with the plaintiff is intending to render her services to another as well. The defendant has terminated her employment/agreement with the plaintiff and it is yet to be determined, whether the defendant could have done so or could not have done so. The senior counsel for the plaintiff has fairly also agreed that the defendant cannot be compelled to continue to render services to the plaintiff. The case at best is thus of breach of agreement and which can ordinarily be compensated with money.”",

                        "content": "14  The matter may be viewed from another angle as well. The contention, of Mr. Sethi, predicated on Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 that the inability to enforce specific performance of a positive covenant in a determinable contract cannot inhibit specific performance of a negative covenant, with which the positive covenant may be coupled, can apply only if the extent of “coupling”, between the positive and negative covenant, is not such that enforcement of the negative covenant would indirectly result in enforcement of the positive covenant. This principle stands underscored by the following words, in para 58 of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Percept  “Likewise, grant of injunction restraining the first respondent would have the effect of compelling the first respondent to be managed by the appellant, in substance in effect a decree of specific performance of an agreement of my judiciary or personal character of service, which is dependent on mutual trust, faith and confidence.”  The negative covenant, which the petitioner seeks to enforce in the present case is contained in Clause 11.2 of the letter of appointment. Clause 11.2 applies only during the currency of employment of the respondent by the petitioner. Enforcement of the negative covenant in Clause 11.2 would, therefore, require the respondent to be treated as continuing to be in the petitioner’s employment, which would amount to indirectly enforcing the positive covenant. Though Section 42 of  the Specific Relief Act, 1963 commences with a non obstante clause and appears, therefore, to be in the nature of an exception to Section 41(e), the exception is limited in nature, conditioned by the specific terms of Section 42. What Section 42 ordains is that the power to enforce the negative covenant would not be affected by the lack of power to enforce the positive covenant. The non obstante nature of Section 42, therefore, does not extend to rendering the positive covenant enforceable, contrary to Section 41(e). To that extent, therefore, it would probably be etymologically more appropriate to treat Section 42 as a proviso to Section 41(e), rather than an exception thereto. It is obvious that Section 42 does not, in any manner, reduce the effect of Section 41(e). It merely clarifies that the inhibition, against injuncting the breach of a contract, which cannot be specifically enforced under Section 14, would not inhibit the Court from enforcing the negative covenant in the contract. The positive covenant remains, nonetheless, unenforceable. It is not possible, therefore, to implement Section 42 in such a way as to indirectly result in enforcement of the positive covenant.  20 (2006) 4 SCC 227",

                        "content": "Reliance of the learned counsel for defendant No.1 on the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in the case of Mr.Manjunath Hedge & Ors. v. Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd. (supra) is misplaced. Relevant paras of the same reads as follows:  •10. The rationale of the impugned order is contained in the following paragraphs of the impugned order:  •To my mind the scope and ambit of the two suits is entirely different. While the inquiry in the suit before the learned Additional District Judge would be limited to the contract alleged of the defendant No.2 herein with the plaintiff and the alleged breach thereof and if so whether the plaintiff would be entitled to damages and injunction, the inquiry in the present suit is as to whether there was a future assignment of copyright under the contract of the defendant No.1 with the plaintiff. If this court finds that there was such an assignment and the work so published infringes the same, then naturally the defendant No.1 as the author and the defendant No.2 as the publisher may be liable for infringement of the said copyright.•  xxxxx  In my opinion the need for the plaintiff to make identical averments qua the defendant No.2 in the plaint in the present suit arose only for the reason that the defendant No.2 is the publisher of the book in the present case also and only as an ancillary to the case of the plaintiff of a contract for assignment of copyright by the defendant No.2 in favour  of the plaintiff and breach thereof by the defendant No.1 in collusion with the defendant No.2. The reason for the said averments appears to be to show that the contract of publishing of the defendant No.1 with the defendant No.2 is not an independent or a fresh contract but is in continuation of the transaction of the defendant No.2 on behalf of the plaintiff, with the defendant No.1. Otherwise, the rights, if any, of the defendant No.2 to carry on business as a publisher are not to be adjudicated in the present suit.  Seen in this light, it will be found that though the witnesses maybe the same in both the suits but their evidence would be entirely different. While the contract of the plaintiff with the defendant No.1 would not be the subject matter of adjudication in the suit before the learned Additional District Judge, that would be the main concern in the present suit.•",

The reliefs claimed are wholly different. The parties are also different in that whereas the suit in the District Court is only against Ex-employee who is now into printing business, in the suit in the original side of this Court there are four defendants; two being the authors and the other two being the Ex-employee and the firm which is carrying on printing/publishing business. The fact that there are some common averments does not mean that there are common issues of law and fact which is required for consolidation of suits. Any doubt that two suits cannot go on merely because and assuming that some of the issues are common is clear from the explanation 1 to Section 11 of CPC which shows that two suits can simultaneously go on and principle of res judicata will apply with respect to that suit/issue which will be decided earlier.•",

The relevant portion of the said judgment reads as follows:  •9. On the facts averred in the two plaints filed by the two parties before two different courts, it is clear that the parties are substantially the same. Jaypee Rewa have alleged and Willard India or Chitivalasa Jute Mills do not deny that Chitivalasa Jute Mills is nothing but a division of Willard India Limited. The fact remains that the cause of action alleged in the two plaints refers to the same period and the same transactions i.e. the supply of jute bags between the period 7-1-1992 and 31-12-1993. What is the cause of action alleged by one party as foundation for the relief prayed for and the decree sought for in one case is the ground of defence in the other case. The issues arising for decision would be substantially common. Almost the same set of oral and documentary evidence would be needed to be adduced for the purpose of determining the issues of facts and law arising for decision in the two suits before two different courts. Thus, there will be duplication of recording of evidence if separate trials are held. The two courts would be writing two judgments. The possibility that the two courts may record findings inconsistent with each other and conflicting decrees may come to be passed cannot be ruled out.  XXX",
