The difference between these two tiers, as visualised and suggested by InterDigital, is that the •outer tier• documents and material would be accessible to the advocates for both sides, experts appointed by them, as well as representatives of both parties, whereas the •inner tier• documents would be accessible only to the advocates for both sides (who would not be in-house counsel), and experts appointed by them.  In other words, •inner tier• documents would not be accessible to representatives of the parties, other than •non-in-house• advocates and the experts appointed by them.

The end, in other words, according to Mr. Anand, justifies the means; on a more culinary note, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Such •two-tier• Confidentiality Clubs having been created by Courts in the past, and having •worked•, without hiccups, Mr. Anand would exhort this Court not to be unduly concerned with whether the setting up of such a Confidentiality Club would compromise full and fair opportunity to both parties.",

Frankly, the response befuddles me.  I am unable to understand how the Court could insist on Xiaomi contracting, with its Counsel, to keep documents shown to its Counsel, and on which InterDigital relies against Xiaomi, undisclosed to Xiaomi itself.  If Xiaomi decides, for some inscrutable reason, to permit its Counsel not to disclose, to it, material, on which InterDigital relies, that is a contractual understanding between Xiaomi and its Counsel, with which the Court is least concerned.  To me, it is clear that the Court cannot, by judicial fiat, impose any such contractual dispensation between Xiaomi and its counsel.",

                        "content": "Mr. Anand did draw my attention to judgements, of courts located outside the territory of India, where such •two-tier• Confidentiality Clubs were set up. Beyond providing, to this Court, information that such Confidentiality Clubs do exist in foreign regimes, I am unwilling to accord, to decisions passed by Courts abroad, any greater significance, in a case such as this.  The jurisprudence of natural justice, due opportunity and fair play has, in this country, its own distinct contour and complexion. The request of InterDigital has to be gauged and assessed in the backdrop of •fair play jurisprudence•, as it exists in India.  The mere fact that courts, overseas, may have acquiesced to the setting up of such Confidentiality Clubs cannot, in my view, be of any substantial significance, in deciding the present application of InterDigital.  I rely, respectfully, in this context, on the following observations, contained in the judgement of the Division Bench of this Court in M. Sivasamy v. Vestergaard Frandsen A/S1 (<>)(hereinafter referred to as •Sivasamy v. Vestergaard•):  •We may state that before the Learned Single Judge, and as reflected from the impugned order, reference has been made by the parties to proceedings between the parties in Courts of U.K., Denmark and France and help sought from such proceedings for the disposal of the subject application. However, according to us, with respect to the litigation in India, the Courts in this country would be guided by the provisions of the Laws as applicable in this country and the pleadings in the suit in this court and not by any orders or decisions of the foreign court, unless, the decision of the foreign Court becomes final and so that it can operate as res judicata between the parties and operate in the parameters of  Section 13 and Section 44-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. No useful purpose will be served in making reference to various orders of the Courts in the different countries as one does not know what are the ingredients/requirements of causes of action of the different laws of those countries and what were the pleadings of the cases in the foreign courts. In fact, we do feel that none of the parties can contend or plead on the basis of orders of the Courts in foreign jurisdiction (particularly interim orders) as there is no finality(including by disposal of appeals) with respect to findings in such orders/judgments, especially in regard to whether the plaintiffs or the concerned defendants are the owners of the product or whether the products are same or different and so on. The orders/judgements in such proceedings having not achieved finality, according to us are not relevant and cannot be relied upon by either of the parties, particularly so where some orders (or portion thereof) are said to be in favour of one party and some in favour of the other.•  I entirely endorse these sentiments.",

Provision has thus been made for keeping such documents in a sealed cover, for eyes only of a limited number of persons who also agree/undertake not to divulge contents thereof to others.  In  some cases, as in cases of patent infringement or infringement of copyright in source code of a computer software, the need for a party to a lis to see the document may not arise as the opinion with respect thereto is to be given by the expert only.•  2 AIR 2019 Del 197  (Emphasis supplied)  The words used in the afore-extracted passage, and italicized therein for emphasis, cannot, by the farthest stretch of imagination, be regarded as according, by this Court, of its imprimatur to setting up of a Confidentiality Club, in which certain documents, or details, are made entirely inaccessible to the opposite party, and its representatives, barring advocates and the experts.  This Court has merely observed that the need for a party to a lis, to see a particular document, may not arise, in some cases of patent infringement of copyright infringement.  Whether there is need, for Xiaomi, or its personnel, to see the documents and data on which InterDigital relies, is one thing; whether InterDigital can insist on such documents, and details, being kept away from Xiaomi, and its personnel, and whether the Court can accord its judicial approval to such insistence, is entirely another.  Significantly, this Court has, in the afore-extracted passage from Transformative Learning Solution2 , being careful in referring only to the •need• of the representatives of the opposite party seeing the documents, •arising•, without stating, in so many words, that either party could insist on the establishment of a regime in which documents and details, on which it relies, could be kept away from the opposite party, and its personnel. It is well settled that a decision is  only an authority for what it decides, and not for what may logically be said to flow therefrom.3 (<>)",

The plaintiffs sought an injunction, against the defendants, from disclosing or using their confidential information and trade secrets, among other things.  The plaintiffs demurred from disclosing the •confidential information•, in the proceedings before the Court.  Ultimately, in exercise of the power vested by Chapter VII Rule 17 of the Original Side Rules, a Confidentiality Club, consisting of Defendants 1 and 2 and their counsel as members, was constituted.  The plaintiffs were directed to supply the confidential information, in a sealed cover, to the counsel for Defendants 1 and 2.  The plaintiffs filed a Review Petition, seeking review of this order, to the extent that it constituted the Confidentiality Club.  It was contended, by the plaintiffs, that Chapter VII Rule 17 of the Original Side Rules, read with Annexure F thereto, did not allow the parties, or their officers and employees, to be members of the Confidentiality Club, which was restricted to the advocates for the parties.  It was pointed out that the proforma for the Confidentiality Club, as provided in Annexure F to the Original Side Rules, did not contemplate inclusion of the parties or their officers or employees, as members thereof.  Reliance was placed on clause (b) in the said proforma, which reads thus:  •Each party shall nominate not more than three Advocates, who are not and have not been in-house lawyers of either party, and not more than 2 external experts,  who shall constitute the Confidentiality Club.

In response, the plaintiffs merely placed reliance on the earlier decision of this Court in Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Publ) v. Xiaomi Technology4 (<>)(referred to, hereinafter, as Ericsson v Xiaomi).  Dealing with the submission, this Court observed, at the outset, thus (in para 21 of the report):  •A civil lis, governed by the CPC, requires each party thereto to have notice of the case of other, which is required to be met and the CPC does not permit any surprises. The trial and adjudication of a civil lis is regulated by pleadings in evidence, documentaries or otherwise, beyond pleadings is not permitted.  The documents of each other are required to be admitted and/or denied and issues on which adjudication is required to be done, struck.

In commercial suits, the provisions of the CPC stand, to some extent, modified or amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. The Original Side Rules of this Court have been framed in exercise of the power conferred by Section 129 of the CPC, which empowers all high Courts, notwithstanding anything contained in the CPC, to make rules to regulate its own procedure in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, as it thinks fit. The non obstante clause, with which Section 129 begins, indicates that the Original Side Rules, framed by the High Court in exercise of the power conferred by the said provision would abide, irrespective of anything to the contrary, that may be found in the CPC.  In a sense, therefore, the Original Side Rules of the High Court would prevail over the procedural dispensations contained in the CPC, to the extent of any overlap.  Rule 17 in Chapter VII of the Original Side Rules, undoubtedly, marks such a departure from the regime of complete transparency, envisaged by the CPC.  It permits parties to a commercial suit, who wish to rely on documents or information which are confidential, to request the Court to constitute a Confidentiality Club, •so as to allow limited access to such documents/information•. The moot question that arises is whether such •limited access• could be so limited as to deny access to the opposite party, as well as its employees and officials, and limit access only to its nominated •ex-house• counsel and experts.",

                        "content": "Having noted, as above, the fact that •surprises• were foreign to the procedural dispensation contained in the CPC, this Court, in Transformative Learning Solutions2 , went on to record the observations, in para-22 of the report, reproduced in para 19 supra, on which Mr. Pravin Anand places reliance.  What is observed in this paragraph?  Has this Court, in the said paragraph, approved the Constitution of Confidentiality Clubs, in which one party, as well as its officials and employees, are kept completely aloof from the documents and material relied upon by the opposite party in the proceedings before the Court?  No such inference can, in my view, be drawn, from a reading of para 22 of the decision in Transformative Learning Solutions2 . This Court has, in the said paragraph, merely observed that, despite the transparency contemplated by the provisions of the CPC, •in respect of a certain class of suits•, it has been felt that documents filed •should not be permitted to go in public domain, as happens on filing in the Court•.  This obviously means that public access, to the documents filed in the litigation, may not be allowed, in respect of a certain class of suits.  This sentence, obviously, does not concern access to the documents/material, by the opposite party.  The paragraph goes on to observe that, in such cases, provision has been made for keeping the documents in a sealed cover, •for eyes only of a limited number of persons who also agree/undertake not to divert contents thereof to others•.  This, essentially, is the raison d•etre of the Confidentiality Club regime. Again, the question that arises is, as to how limited, this •limited number of persons• should be.  Para 22 goes on to state that, in some  cases, as in cases of patent infringement, •the need for a party to a lis to see the documents may not arise•, as the opinion, with respect thereto, is to be given only by the expert.  In my opinion, however, it would be erroneous, on the part of this Court, to read, into this observation, anything more than what it says. As this Court has correctly observed, there may be documents, relied upon by one party, on which expert opinion is provided, which may not be need to be seen by the opposite party, as an expert has already opined on the document.  That, however, would be an issue which arises on a document-to-document basis, based on the document and the contents of the report of the expert.  Whether either of the parties, to a litigation, needs, or does not need, to see a particular document, would be a decision which essentially rests with the party itself.  Can InterDigital, simply put, assert that Xiaomi does not need to see a document on which InterDigital places reliance, to contest the case initiated by it against Xiaomi?  The answer, in my view, has unexceptionably to be in the negative.  It would be stretching the observation of this Court, in Transformative Learning Solutions2 to breaking point, if one were to read, into it, judicial affirmation of the right of a party to a litigation to require the Court to permit him to withhold, from the opposite party as well as all its officials and employees, documents and material on which he seeks to rely.  4 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11069",

However in the present suit to restrain defendants from using confidential information of plaintiffs and for ancillary  reliefs, the defendants are permitted to defend the suit inter alia on the grounds, that the plaintiffs have no copyright in the customers list and even if the plaintiffs have a copyright, the defendants have not infringed the same. I may mention that the suit has been filed as a commercial suit and not as an ordinary suit. This suit, under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, can qualify as a commercial suit only if arising out of intellectual property rights relating to trade marks, copyright, patent, design etc. and not if arising out of property rights or a tort. In such a suit, to ask the defendants to contest the suit without knowing the customers list in which copyright is claimed and without knowing what they are sought to be restrained from doing, would not only be unfair to the defendants but also would be contrary to procedure prescribed by law. The Advocates of defendants and experts, even if any possible in such scenario, cannot be expected to make pleadings, to meet the case of plaintiffs. The non disclosure to the defendant sought by the plaintiffs, in my opinion deprives the defendant of opportunity of being heard and the right to defend the suit.",

This, opined the Court, effectively resulted in the defendant being kept unaware of what it was sought to be restrained from doing, which was impermissible. The position, in the present case, is a trifle more nuanced, but is effectively equally damaging, insofar as the defendant is concerned. The plaintiff, InterDigital, in the present case, also seeks an injunction, against the defendant, from infringing its patents.  It is true that, unlike Transformative Learning Solutions2 , the plaintiff does not seek to withhold, from the defendant, the patents, in respect of which infringement is alleged, and restraint, in respect whereof, is sought. Patent infringement, in the case of SEPs has, however, a unique feature. A holder of an SEP is not entitled, of right, to seek injunction against infringement of its SEP, merely on making out a case of such infringement.  The patent holder is also required to establish that it is FRAND compliant. This, essentially, means that every holder of an SEP is required, in law, to agree to the licensing of its SEP to willing licensees.  •Willing licensees• are those who are willing to take a license, to exploit the SEP, on payment of royalty, to the patent holder, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.  It is for this reason that, even in the present case, the plaintiff has not sought an absolute injunction, against the defendant, from infringing its SEPs.  An alternative prayer, for a direction to the defendant to obtain a license, from the plaintiff, for using its SEPs at FRAND rates, has also been made.  Indeed, as is acknowledged by Mr. Pravin Anand, such a prayer has necessarily to be made in every  application seeking injunction against exploitation of an SEP, given the global ramifications and implications that such exploitation has. In such a scenario, disputes and differences, regarding the FRAND rates which may legitimately be charged by the SEP holder, is nearly inevitable.  Such a dispute has, predictably, arisen in the present case, as it is the plaintiffs• assertion that, though the defendant has agreed to take a license, for exploitation of the suit SEPs of the plaintiffs, the rate offered by the defendant is not FRAND. The plaintiffs, therefore, seek, inter alia, determination of a FRAND rate, as a viable alternative, for the defendants to avoid an absolute injunction.",

For this, a holistic appreciation of the license agreements, between the plaintiff and other licensees, is absolutely essential. To say that this exercise can be meaningfully undertaken by limiting access to such agreements and the contents thereof, to the Court, the plaintiff, and advocates and experts of the defendant, keeping the defendant, as well as its employees and associates, entirely •out of the loop• as it were is, in my view, unthinkable.

It is obvious that, in contesting the prayer, of the plaintiff, for a direction, to the defendant, to take a license from the plaintiff at rates similar, or comparable, to those at which licences have been granted, by the plaintiff, to other licensees, the defendant would be entitled to contend that such rates are not FRAND, i.e., that they are not fair, reasonable, or non-discriminatory.

One circumstance, however, immediately comes to mind. FRAND terms are required to be, per definition, •nondiscriminatory•.  Whether, in extending a particular royalty rate to a licensee, for exploitation of its SEP, the plaintiff has discriminated, favourably or otherwise, qua that particular licensee, becomes, therefore, a relevant consideration, in assessing whether the rate  extended to the licensee is, or is not, FRAND.   Mr. Sai Krishna Rajagopal has, in fact, pointed out that, in order to assess whether the royalty rate, at which InterDigital has licensed its SEPs to any third party, is, or is not, FRAND, it would be necessary for Xiaomi to know the identity of the licensee, the exact scope of the license granted to the licensee, the area over which the licenses granted, and all considerations, on the basis of which the royalty rate has been worked out in the license. Ex facie, the submission merits acceptance; indeed, Mr. Pravin Anand did not seriously contest this position. Mr. Anand•s submission, in response, is that knowledge of, and access to, the third-party license agreements, by •ex-house• advocates, and experts nominated by Xiaomi, would suffice for this purpose, and disclosure to Xiaomi, its officers and personnel, is not necessary.  The submission, in my view, is far too presumptive, to merit consideration. These are matters having huge commercial implications, and worldwide markets, and to expect a party to meaningfully present its case, without being shown the •comparable license agreements•, merely allowing its counsel and experts to work out the arguments without instructions is, in my view, bordering on the preposterous.  At the very least, the first question that would arise would be whether, in fact, such •license agreements• are •comparable•.  It is always open to the defendant to argue that they are not.  How is he expected to do so, without being made aware of the license agreements themselves? The very concept of •comparison• involves a juxtaposition of the circumstances applicable to the defendants vis-à-vis the circumstances in which such other licensee was placed.  Who, other than the defendant, would be best aware of its circumstances, or whether its  case is comparable to the case of another licensee, on whom the plaintiff places reliance? How, then, is the defendant expected to instruct its advocate, regarding whether the agreement, with such other licensee is, or is not, •comparable•?  The damage that would ensue, to the fundamental principles of natural justice, fair play and due process, were the defendant to be excluded access from such allegedly •comparable• license agreements, is serious and irreparable. Any procedural arrangement, which is fraught with the possibility of such damage has, in my view, to be unequivocally jettisoned.",

It reads thus:  •With respect to Tier 2, there is a pressing need to ensure that internal representatives and other employees of the parties do not have access to documents which are marked and designated as LEO Confidential Information (particularly third-party patent license agreements).  This is because such documents contain sensitive commercial information, including trade secrets concerning the Plaintiffs and their licensees, such that disclosure of such information is strictly restricted in the license agreements.  If such information is placed in the hands of other parties such as the Defendants, and if it is misused or further disclosed thereafter, it could cause such grave prejudice to the commercial interests of the Plaintiffs, as well as the third party entities, who in many instances are competitors to the Defendants.  In the case that such confidential and sensitive information is disclosed to the Defendants, or is disclosed to other third parties thereafter, then it will cause grave prejudice not just to the Plaintiffs, but their third party licensees as well, since it will be very difficult for the Plaintiffs to be able to negotiate future licence agreements with licensees who cannot be assured that the confidentiality obligations with respect to such negotiations can be complied with.  In such a situation, any order from this Hon•ble Court passed later cannot reverse the damage.•  In making the above averments, InterDigital seems to have omitted, from consideration, two essential factors; firstly, that litigation is not a one-way street and, secondly, that InterDigital has invited Xiaomi into the arena, and not vice versa.  InterDigital has waxed eloquent on the •irreversible damage• that would result, were confidential data, contained in the license agreements with third parties, to be disclosed to Xiaomi.

Members of the Confidentiality Club alone shall be entitled to inspect the Confidential Documents/ Information.  c)  Members of the Confidentiality Club shall be allowed to inspect the Confidential Documents/ Information before the Registrar General, without making copies thereof. After the inspection, the Confidential Documents/ Information shall be resealed and kept in the custody of the Registrar General.  d)  Members of the Confidentiality Club shall not make copies of, or disclose, or publish the contents of, the Confidential Documents/ Information to anyone else in any manner or by any means, or in any other legal proceedings and shall be bound by the orders of the Court in this behalf.  e)  During recordal of evidence with respect to the Confidential Documents/ Information, only members of the Confidentiality Club shall be allowed to remain present.  f)  During proceedings of the Court, when the Confidential Documents/ Information are being looked at or their contents discussed, only members of the Confidentiality Club shall be permitted to be present.  g)  The Court may in its discretion and in an appropriate case, permit copies of the Confidential Documents to be given to the opposite party after redacting confidential information therefrom, if such redaction be possible and not otherwise.  h)  Any evidence by way of affidavit or witness statement containing confidential information derived from the Confidential Documents/ Information shall be kept in a sealed cover with the  Registrar General and would be accessible only to the members of the Confidentiality Club. However, a party filing such evidence by way of affidavit shall, if so directed by the Court, give to the opposite party, a copy of such affidavit after redacting therefrom the confidential information, if such redaction is possible and not otherwise.  i)  The Confidential Documents/ Information shall not be available for inspection after disposal of the matter, except to the Party producing the same.  j)  In cases where the Confidentiality Club is constituted or documents are directed to be kept confidential, the Court may consider extending the time for filing of pleadings. However, the same shall be within the overall limits prescribed by the applicable provisions.•  Clause (b) of the •Protocol of Confidentiality Club•, as stipulated in Annexure F, clearly excludes the parties, as well as their officials and representatives, from the Club.  Membership of the Confidentiality Club, constituted in the manner envisaged by Annexure F is, clearly, limited to three advocates and not more than two external experts.

One may reproduce, to advantage, the following passages, from the judgement of the Supreme Court in Himalayan Coop.  Group Housing Society v. Balwan Singh5 (<>), which place the legal position beyond any pale of doubt:  •22. Apart from the above, in our view lawyers are perceived to be their client's agents. The law of agency may not strictly apply to the client-lawyer's relationship as lawyers or agents, lawyers have certain authority and certain duties. Because lawyers are also fiduciaries, their duties will sometimes be more demanding than those imposed on other agents. The authority-agency status affords the lawyers to act for the client on the subject-matter of the retainer. One of the most basic principles of the lawyer-client relationship is that lawyers owe fiduciary duties to their clients. As part of those duties, lawyers assume all the traditional duties that agents owe to their principals and, thus, have to respect the client's autonomy to make decisions at a minimum, as to the objectives of the representation. Thus, according to generally accepted notions of professional responsibility, lawyers should follow the client's instructions rather than substitute their judgment for that of the client. The law is now well settled that a lawyer must be specifically authorised to settle and compromise a claim, that merely on the basis of his employment he has no implied or ostensible authority to bind his client to a compromise/settlement. To put it alternatively that a lawyer by virtue of retention, has the authority to choose the means for achieving the client's legal goal, while the client has the right to decide on what the goal will be. If the decision in question falls within those that clearly belong to the client, the lawyer's conduct in failing to consult the client or in making the decision for the client, is more likely to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.",

First, the implied authority of counsel is not an appendage of office, a dignity added by the courts to the status of barrister or advocate at law. It is implied in the interests of the client, to give the fullest beneficial effect to his employment of the advocate. Secondly, the implied authority can always be countermanded by the express directions of the client. No advocate has actual authority to settle a case against the express instructions of his client. If he considers such express instructions contrary to the interests of his client, his remedy is to return his brief.•  (See: Jamilabai Abdul Kadar v.

Sivasamy v Vestergaard1 involved a challenge to an order, of a learned Single Judge of this Court, directing discovery and production of documents, under Rules 12 and 14 of Order XI of the CPC.  The Division Bench went, in great detail, into the said provisions and, ultimately, set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and remanded the matter to the learned Single Judge to devise a procedure, to ensure that information, documents, etc., of which production was sought by the plaintiff, and which pertained to the products of the defendants, could be kept confidential so as to avoid  prejudice to the defendants. In essence, therefore, the Division Bench remanded the matter to the learned Single Judge to constitute a Confidentiality Club.  Before the learned Single Judge, there was no dispute, relating to the constitution of the Confidentiality Club. Indeed, a reading of the decision does not even disclose the membership of the said Club.  The learned Single Judge only proceeded to work out the mechanics, by which the Confidentiality Club would operate.  This decision, therefore, is of no assistance, to the case at hand.

Ericsson sought to rely on various licensing agreements with third parties, but contended that they contained, apart from the licensing rates, business sensitive information which was confidential in nature. While contesting the claim of Ericsson on merits, Lava also opposed the constitution of the Confidentiality Club in the terms proposed by  Ericsson, stating that the said terms were onerous,  and impeded the defendant from being able to fairly present its case.

The plaintiff Dolby International (hereinafter referred to as •Dolby•) claimed confidentiality in respect of the licensing rates,  vis-à-vis third parties.  The defendant opposed the request, stating that, in order for the defendant to be able to marshal an effective defence, it was required to be disclosed the name of the licensee, the date of the patent license agreement and the license of the patented product as well as the licensing rate.  For this purpose, the defendant sought the inclusion of one of its representatives in the Confidentiality Club, other than lawyers and experts.  Relying on, inter alia, the earlier order of this Court in MVF 3 APS8 , the learned Single Judge held that a consistent view had been taken, by this Court, allowing only lawyers and external experts as members of the Confidentiality Club. He further observed that the reasons for such an arrangement were already set out in the earlier decisions of this Court, and did not require recapitulation.  Further observing that •no other Indian decision contrary to the decision in MVF 3 APS8 and Roche Products (India) Pvt Ltd v. Drugs Controller General of India12 (<>)had been cited before him, the learned Single Judge held that •the nature of litigation• in the case before him was •such that access to confidential documents in question by a representative of contesting defendants is not warranted•.  I would briefly advert to this decision, and its effect on the view that I propose to take in this application, later in the course of this judgement.  11 Order dated 4th August, 2017, by a learned Single Judge in IA 6911/2017 in CS (Comm) 1425/2016",

Xiaomi4 , too, saw the establishment of a Confidentiality Club along the lines advocated by Mr. Pravin Anand, in that the parties, as well as their officials and representatives, were excluded therefrom.  The judgements cited by Mr. Anand before me  were also cited before the learned Single Judge in the said case.  As against this, Mr. Rajagopal, who appeared for the defendant in the said case as well, relied on Himalayan Coop.

The learned Single Judge, however, did not return any finding on the said submission, but chose to constitute the Confidentiality Club excluding the defendant, as well as its officers and employees, on the ground that similar Confidentiality Clubs stood constituted in earlier judgements of this Court, to which reference has already been made hereinabove. Additionally, the learned Single Judge relied on Section 103(3) of the Patents Act which, with greatest respect to the learned Single Judge, may not apply as the provision pertains to cases where the disclosure of a document, regarding any invention, or the evidence of the test or trial thereof, is prejudicial to public interest in the opinion of the Central Government.  In such circumstances, Section 103(3) permits disclosure of the documents regarding the invention, or the evidence of the test of trial thereof, confidentially to the advocate of the other party, or to a mutually agreed independent expert.",

Drugs Controller General of India13 (<>).  The third defendant in this case (whose identity is not immediately apparent from the judgement) sought to file certain documents in a sealed cover.  In the said application, a learned Single Judge of this Court passed an order on 12th February, 2020, appointing an advocate as a Local Commissioner, before whom the documents would be inspected by two advocates and an expert, from the side of the plaintiffs, in the presence of two advocates from the side of the defendants. A subsequent application was filed, by the third defendant, submitting that the plaintiffs had appointed an in-house expert, which was not acceptable. The third defendant sought to contend that permitting inspection of the confidential documents by an in-house expert of the opposite side would defeat the very purpose of the constitution of Confidentiality Clubs, which was to ensure that sanctity and confidentiality of commercially sensitive information, filed by a party, was maintained. Reliance was placed,  by the third defendant, on Rule 17 in Chapter VII of the Original Side Rules read with the protocol envisaged in Annexure F thereto. It was sought to be pointed out that Annexure F to the Original Side Rules contemplated inclusion, in the Confidentiality Club, only of an external expert. Reliance was also placed on Section 103(3) of the Patents Act, as well  12 2016 SCC OnLine Del 2358  13 MANU/DE/0670/2020",

In such a suit, to ask the defendants to contest the suit without knowing the customers list in which copyright is claimed and without knowing what they are sought to be restrained from doing, would not only be unfair to the defendants but also would be contrary to procedure prescribed by law.

Mr. Pravin Anand responded that this precise issue had been considered by several courts in India and abroad, and that, after considering the issue, Confidentiality Clubs, excluding officials and representatives of the opposite party, had in fact been constituted.

                        "content": "Certain ancillary submissions, also advanced by Mr. Pravin Anand, may be dealt with, as under:  (i)  Mr. Pravin Anand pointed out that the contracts, between the plaintiffs and the third-party licensees, contained confidentiality clauses, which did not allow the plaintiffs to disclose the contents of the agreements to third parties. That, to my mind, is irrelevant. No confidentiality clause, which may be contained in third-party license agreements, entered into between the plaintiffs and third-party licensees, can justify denial of fair opportunity, to the defendants, to meet the case set up by the plaintiffs.  Fair opportunity, to the defendants, in my view, cannot be said to be granted, if the defendants are not allowed access to the third-party license agreements, which constitute the very basis for the allegedly FRAND rate proposed by the plaintiffs.  The business interests of InterDigital, howsoever legitimate, cannot prevail over the paramount consideration of grant of fair opportunity, and natural justice, to Xiaomi, to meet the case set up by InterDigital.  The choice, between these two competing considerations, in my view, is Hobsonian in nature.  (ii)  Mr. Pravin Anand further invited my attention to para 35 of the rejoinder, filed by the plaintiffs to the reply, of the defendants, to the present application.  It reads thus:  •It is evident that the present proceedings are of a highly technical nature and high-level of expert involvement is inevitable.  Since the matter in question in the present proceedings is of so esoterically technical in nature, the Defendants would necessarily require technical and professional experts and may not be able to form an opinion on their own but would be  bound to act merely upon advice on the technical and professional experts. Since the aid of the technical and professional experts is inevitable, the Hon•ble Court will be justified in directing disclosure of confidential information only to external lawyers and expert of the Defendants with the exclusion of the Defendants in-house counsel and employees to secure the rights of the Plaintiffs and its third-party licensees.  Further, it is reiterated that the Plaintiffs are contractually obligated not to disclose to any entity, the third-party license agreements, and/or the contents thereof, unless they are ordered by this Hon•ble Court.  The Defendant•s contention that the Plaintiffs must place on record such agreements, without protective orders of this Hon•ble Court is an invitation to the Plaintiffs to willingly breach their confidentiality obligations for such agreements.  The Plaintiffs cannot be compelled to make such disclosures in the absence of protective orders of this Hon•ble Court.  Such a contention of the Defendants is clearly mala fide and should be dismissed.•  The submissions contained in the afore-extracted para from the rejoinder of the plaintiffs, in my opinion, are inherently unacceptable for a variety of reasons, viz.  (a)  It is totally presumptuous, on the part of the plaintiffs, to assert that the defendants •may not be able to form an opinion on the road but would be bound to act merely upon advice of the technical and professional experts•.  The word •merely•, in my view, has been deliberately added in this proposition, so as to justify the request, of InterDigital, for excluding officials and employees of Xiaomi from the •inner tier• Confidentiality Club. No educated litigant, in today•s day and age, prefers to remain in an ivory tower, unaware  of the facts of the case, leaving his fortune entirely in the hands of his advocates and/or experts.  Especially in a litigation as complex as this, involving fixation of FRAND rates and determination of the issue of whether Xiaomi is, or is not, infringing the SEPs of InterDigital, it is a prime necessity that the officials of Xiaomi, who are conversant with its activities, and who can take a decision on the rate at which Xiaomi can take a license, for exploitation of the SEPs, from InterDigital, are kept abreast of all aspects of the case set up by InterDigital, a prime element of which would be the allegedly •comparable• license agreements, on the basis of which FRAND rates are proposed by InterDigital.  (b)  In the very next sentence, it is averred that, •since the aid of the technical and professional experts is inevitable, the Hon•ble Court will be justified in directing disclosure of confidential information only to external lawyers and expert of the defendants which the exclusion of the defendants in-house counsel and employees•.  The very fact that Xiaomi would only, at best, be obtaining the •aid• of the technical and professional experts, is itself a reason to include, in the Confidentiality Club, the officials of Xiaomi.  •Aid• can be extended only to someone who is aware of the facts, including all particulars of the stand adopted by the opposite party.  (c)  The assertion that, by requiring InterDigital to place on record the third-party license agreements, InterDigital is being invited to •willingly breach their confidentiality obligations for such agreements• is completely tangential to the issue at hand.  Nobody is inviting InterDigital to breach any of its obligations, with its third-party licensees.  If, however, in its litigation with Xiaomi, InterDigital intends to rely on third-party license agreements, so as to be able to fix, with Xiaomi, a FRAND rate of its choice, that cannot be done by keeping away, from Xiaomi, the third-party license agreements, on which InterDigital seeks to rely to justify such FRAND rate.  As such, the further assertion, in para 35 of its rejoinder, that the plaintiff, i.e. InterDigital, cannot be compelled to make disclosures in the absence of protective orders of this Court, is also tangential to the issue at hand.  In fact, I am constrained to observe that, in making its submissions, both written as well as orally during the course of arguments, InterDigital seems to be oblivious of the necessity of justice being done to Xiaomi, as much as to InterDigital. The business interests of InterDigital cannot be placed on a higher pedestal than those of Xiaomi.  The financial implications of an unreasonable FRAND rate are huge. It would be completely unreasonable, therefore, to thrust, on Xiaomi, a FRAND rate, in the exercise of fixation of which neither Xiaomi, nor any of its officials or personnel, have been  allowed to participate.  The complete iniquity of the arrangement is underscored by the insistence, of InterDigital, that the advocates, to be included in the •inner tier• Confidentiality Club, should not be •in-house• counsel.  In other words, the prayer of InterDigital is for Xiaomi to be completely dissociated, as it were, from the exercise of FRAND rate fixation, relying entirely on strangers and their subjective opinions, even if such strangers are professionally engaged by Xiaomi for the purpose.  InterDigital, on the other hand, would have the advantage of all its in-house legal personnel being privy to the third-party license agreements, as the agreements are being relied upon by InterDigital itself.  Such a position is, to my thinking, completely unacceptable in law.  (iii)  Mr. Pravin Anand also sought to contend that this •two-tiered• Confidentiality Club management was needed only as a regime, in place during the consideration of InterDigital•s prayer for interim injunction, and that this regime could be modified later.  That, in my view, would be seeking to bolt the stables after the horses have fled.  Once an interlocutory injunction is obtained, without grant of due opportunity to the defendants, it is a matter of common knowledge that, in such litigations, the damage, to the defendants, is permanent and irreversible.",

The exercise involved in this assessment, Mr. Rajagopal submits, justifiably, is entirely factual in nature, involving elements which are within the peculiar knowledge of Xiaomi. An external expert, submits Mr. Rajagopal, would have no intimate knowledge of the activities of Xiaomi.  While it may, conceivably, be possible for an external expert to opine whether the conduct of InterDigital, vis-à-vis the licensees in other license agreements, is FRAND or not, working out of a FRAND rate, between InterDigital and Xiaomi, would require the peculiar business realities of Xiaomi to be borne in mind.

It is apparent, ex facie, that the determination of the issue of whether Xiaomi should be required, by judicial fiat, to take a license from InterDigital, for exploitation of its SEPs, on payment of royalty at the rate suggested by InterDigital, involves myriad complex factors, which hardly need enumeration.  An assessment of these factors, only  by •strangers•, i.e. advocates who are not in-house counsel and external experts, without allowing the officials of Xiaomi access to the license agreements, wherein the rates proposed by InterDigital have been offered to the licensees, in my view, would be impossible or, at the very least, grossly unfair.",

It is no answer, in my opinion, to contend • as Mr. Pravin Anand would seek to urge • that Xiaomi is also entitled to the same privilege.  The plaint has been brought by InterDigital.  InterDigital is the SEP holder.  InterDigital is required, by law, to allow exploitation of SEPs by Xiaomi, by granting a license to Xiaomi at FRAND rates.  The rate offered by Xiaomi is unacceptable to InterDigital.  InterDigital, instead, is requiring Xiaomi to agree to take a license, from InterDigital, at the rate at which it offers the SEPs to other licensees.  Third-party license agreements would, therefore, obviously be produced by InterDigital, rather than by Xiaomi, in support of its case.  As such, the occasion for Xiaomi to request for any such •two-tier• Confidentiality Club, ex hypothesi, does not arise.  Even if it did, it would be for InterDigital to arrive at an agreement, with Xiaomi, for the establishment of a •two-tier• Confidentiality Club, excluding officers and personnel of the parties from access to the •inner tier• confidential documents.  This Court  cannot trust such an arrangement upon Xiaomi, without its consent, in the absence of any clear right having been established, by InterDigital, for the imposition, on Xiaomi, of such an arrangement.",

What if Xiaomi says that it is not willing to contract, with its counsel, to keep undisclosed, from Xiaomi, the documents which have been shown to him?  Mr. Pravin Anand submits that, if Xiaomi is unwilling for such an arrangement, the Court could legitimately draw an adverse inference against, treating it as an •unwilling licensee•.  In other words, Mr. Pravin Anand submits that, having involved Xiaomi in a litigative exercise, by filing the present suit against it, InterDigital can insist on Xiaomi prosecuting the suit, and defending itself against InterDigital, without being shown the documents on which InterDigital proposes to rely. The insistence, by Xiaomi, on access to the documents on which InterDigital proposes to rely, so as to be able to defend the case set up by InterDigital, according to Mr. Pravin Anand, would justify an adverse inference against Xiaomi.

For the sake of the record, it may be noted that Mr. Pravin Anand cited, apart from the judgements of this Court, noted hereinabove, the judgement of the High Court of England and Wales in Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation v.  Sun Cupid Technology HK Ltd14 (<>), the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Blue Spike, LLC v.  Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd15 (<>), the Chancery Division of the High Court in Unwired Planet International Ltd v.  Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd16 (<>), the judgement of the Court of Appeal, on appeal from the said decision, in Unwired Planet International Ltd v. Huawei Technologies Co.

Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson18 (<>)and the judgement of the Chancery Division of the High Court of UK in IPCom GMBH & Co.  v.  HTC Europe Co. Ltd19 (<>). Without adverting to each of these decisions, a reading thereof would reveal that no serious dispute, regarding exclusion of the officials from the Confidentiality Club, was agitated in any of these cases. Besides, as I have already opined hereinabove, I had to decide the present application on the basis of whether the request of InterDigital is compatible with the peculiar dynamics of the lawyer-client relationship, as they exist in this  country. This relationship is crystallised in both statute and precedent, and is sacred and inviolable.  In my view, there can be no question of this Court lending its approval to any arrangement in which the third-party license agreements , constituting the very basis of the case set up by InterDigital against Xiaomi, remain undisclosed to Xiaomi, as well as its officials and personnel, and are shown only to advocates (who are not in-house counsel) and experts. Any such arrangement would violate the provisions of the Bar Council Rules as well as the law laid down in various decisions including, inter alia, Himalayan Coop.  14 Judgement dated 22nd July, 2020 in Claim No HP-2019-000014  15 Judgement dated 1st September, 2015 in Civil Action No 6:13-CV-679-RWS  16 (2017) EWHC 3083 (Pat) 17 (2018) EWCA Civ 2344  18 Judgement dated 8th December, 2015 in Case No. 8:14-CV-00341-JVS-AN  19 (2013) EWHC 52 (Pat)",

Such a contention was raised in Ericsson v. Xiaomi4 , and the judgement in Himalayan Coop.  Group Housing Society5 was also cited in support.  The learned Single Judge in that case did not, however, return any finding regarding the applicability of the said decision, but proceeded to set up the Confidentiality Club, excluding officials and personnel of Xiaomi, on the ground that similar confidential clubs had been set up earlier.",

The judgement binds me, under Article 141 of the Constitution of India.  It is clearly held, by the Supreme Court, in the said decision, that a counsel has to act on instructions from the client, and not at his own sweet will.  It is also pointed out, by the Supreme Court, in the said decision, that the Bar Council of India Rules specifically codifies this requirement. Accepting the proposal, of InterDigital, to constitute a Confidentiality Club, excluding the officials and personnel of Xiaomi therefrom, insofar as the •inner tier• documents are concerned, in my view, would violate this legal regime.  For the reasons set out in detail hereinabove, any such arrangement would also be grossly unfair to  Xiaomi, and would certainly prejudice Xiaomi, in defending the case set up by InterDigital.  It is presumptuous to assume that Xiaomi would be able to answer the case set up, by InterDigital, regarding fixation of a FRAND royalty rate, at which InterDigital could license the usage of its SEPs to Xiaomi, without being provided access to the third-party license agreements, containing the rates proposed by Xiaomi.  Even if this were hypothetically possible, I cannot adjudicate this application on that premise.  20 For the proposition that a decision is not an authority for an argument which passes sub silentio, having neither been raised not considered in the said decision, one may refer to Arnit Das v. State of Bihar, (2000) 5 SCC 488 .",

InterDigital is, therefore, at liberty to redact, from the documents being treated as confidential, any such detail which, according to it, cannot be disclosed to any third party, including the representatives of Xiaomi.  InterDigital cannot,  - however, be permitted, in such an event, to rely on such redacted material. The interests of natural justice and fair play also require that Xiaomi be allowed to plead, in such an event, that the redacted details had been unfairly or unjustifiably redacted, and that their disclosure is necessary in order to enable Xiaomi to put up a substantial defence. In such an eventuality, it would be for the court to take a decision on the competing claims, regarding such redacted material.  No preemptive direction, in that regard, can possibly be issued.",

The members of the confidentiality club shall also be entitled to electronically transmit and receive copies of the confidential information so long as adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that such transmission shall only be available to members of the confidentiality club.  (v)  The members of the confidentiality club shall be bound by confidentiality orders passed by this Court and will not be allowed to make copies, disclose or publish the contents of the confidential information or documents anywhere else or to any individuals who are not privy to the confidential information, including in other legal proceedings or oral and written communications to the press, etc.  (vi)  During the recording of evidence and other proceedings of this Court with respect to the confidential information, or when the confidential information is being looked at, only  members of the confidentiality club shall be allowed to remain present.  Such proceedings will be conducted in camera.  (vii)  Any evidence, by way of affidavit or witness statement, containing confidential information shall also be kept in a sealed cover reflecting the confidential and designation, with the learned Registrar General, and would be accessible only to the members of the confidentiality club.  (viii)  Neither party would be permitted to rely on any material which is not disclosed to the nominated representatives (as opposed to advocates and experts) of the opposite party. Should either party feel that any details, contained in any document, cannot be shown to the nominated representatives of the opposite party, it is at liberty to redact such details or particulars from the document(s) in question.  Needless to say, the party that redacts any particular is, in any document or evidence, shall not be permitted to rely on such a redacted particulars.  It shall, however, be open to the opposite party to plead that disclosure of such redacted material is necessary for its defence.  In such a case, the court would decide, on a document-to-document basis, whether redacting of the •confidential• details, in the document, should, or should not, be allowed.  This, in my view, is the maximum extent to which the plea, of InterDigital, for keeping away, from the representatives of Xiaomi, •confidential• details and documents, can be accommodated.

It is pleaded that in the present case, admittedly no public interest has been pleaded or established.

In  my opinion, the directions appear to be vague. This is so as the petitioner claims that the entire information which is subject matter of the minutes of the board meetings and resolutions contain confidential information which are exempt in terms of Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act. Hence, while complying with the above directions of respondent No. 1, the petitioner would well be within its right to severe virtually the entire information as stated in the minutes of the board meetings.",

In the said judgment, the Court held that indiscriminate and impractical demands under the RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information unrelated to transparency and accountability would be counterproductive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in executive getting bogged down with non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The relevant para of the said judgment reads as follows:- “67. Indiscriminate and impractical demands or directions under the RTI Act for disclosure of all and sundry information (unrelated to transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and eradication of corruption) would be counterproductive as it will adversely affect the efficiency of the administration and result in the executive getting bogged down with the non-productive work of collecting and furnishing information. The Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquillity and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising “information furnishing”, at the cost of their normal and regular duties.”  In my opinion, the above judgment may apply to the facts of this case. The application for information as framed seems to seek indiscriminate and impractical demands for disclosure of all and sundry information. However, a firm conclusion cannot be reached as full details are not on record.",

In that case also the applicant had sought minutes of meetings of RBI Board for two years and minutes of meetings of the Committee of Directors. This court in that case held as follows:- “7. It would thus be seen that the Commission did not at all deal with the view taken by the CPIO and the First Appellate Authority that the information sought by the respondent was exempt under Section 8 (1)(d) of the Act which exempts that information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information. The Commission did not opine that the minutes of the board meetings for the last two years would not contain any information in the nature of commercial confidence, trade secret or intellectual property of the petitioner-bank, the disclosure of which could harm the competitive position of a third party. The Commission also did not take the view that larger pubic interest warranted disclosure of the information sought by the respondent. In fact, probably, the Commission could not even have recorded such a finding without examining the minutes of the board meetings held in the last two years.  It is true that the Commission directed exclusion of the information which was exempt under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act, but, that, in my view, was not a correct approach to deal with the matter. By doing so, the Commission left the whole thing to the discretion of the petitioner to decide as to which information would be exempt from disclosure and which information would not attract the exemption provisions contained in the Act. The correct approach, in my view, would have been to call upon the petitioner-bank to satisfy the Commission as to how and to what extent the information sought by the petitioner, included matters of commercial confidence, trade secret or intellectual property of the petitioner the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party and then take a view in the matter. For this purpose, the Commission could also have examined such part of the information which the petitioner claimed to be exempt under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act, without disclosing the same to the respondent. Of course, if the Commission was of the view that larger public interest warranted disclosure of the information, it could have directed such disclosure even if the information was in the nature of commercial confidence, trade secret or intellectual property of the petitioner, but, to leave it to the petitioner to decide as to which information was exempt from disclosure and which could be disclosed to the applicant is likely to result in further litigation since the applicant may not be satisfied with the decision of the petitioner-bank in this regard and may be constrained to again knock at the door of the Commission.”",

The CIC while looking at the aforesaid matter afresh may keep into account the above observations of the Supreme Court to determine as to whether the demand of respondent No. 2 for minutes of all the Board Meetings for the stated period would fall in the category of being counterproductive and a misuse/abuse of the RTI Act that was frowned upon by the Supreme Court.",

Section 3 of the said Act provides for the establishment of a Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers• Right (PPVFR) Authority with  the functions prescribed in Section 8. Section 12 provides for establishment of a Plant Varieties Registry at the head office of PPVFR Authority, for the purpose of facilitating the registration of plant varieties and empowers the PPVFR Authority to appoint the Registrar General of Plant Varieties. Section 13 provides for maintenance of a National Register of Plant Varieties at the head office of the Plant Varieties Registry, for entering the names of all the registered plant varieties, with the names and addresses of their respective breeders. Section 14 of the PPVFR Act enables making of an application by any person claiming to be the breeder of a plant variety or to be successor or assignee of the breeder of the plant variety, to the Registrar of Plant Varieties, for registration of any plant variety. Section 15 lays down the criteria / tests to be satisfied for registration of a plant variety. Suffice it is to state that a variety which conforms to the criteria of novelty, distinctiveness, uniformity and stability is registrable. Section 21 provides for advertisement of the application for registration and consideration of objections thereto. Section 24 provides for issuance of a certificate for registration and Section 28 provides that a certificate of registration shall confer an exclusive right on the breeder or his successor or agent or licensee, to produce, sell, market, distribute, import or export the variety. Section 30 however provides that nothing contained in the Act shall prevent the use of any variety registered under the Act for conducting experiments or research or as an initial source of variety for the purpose of creating other varieties. Section 42 protects innocent infringement and Section 47 empowers PPVFR Authority to grant compulsory licence of any plant variety registered with it. Section 54 provides for the establishment of a Plant Varieties Protection Appellate Tribunal, to hear and decide appeals against the order or decision  of PPVFR Authority or Plant Variety Registrar, relating to registration of a variety. Section 64 provides that a right established under the Act is infringed by a person, who not being a breeder of a variety registered under the Act, sells, exports, imports or produces any such variety without the permission of the breeder or uses sells, exports, imports or produces any other variety giving such variety the denomination identical with or deceptively similar to the denomination of a variety registered under the Act, in such manner as to cause confusion in the minds of general people, in identifying such variety so registered. Section 65 provides that no suit for infringement of variety registered under the Act or relating to any right in a variety registered under the Act shall be instituted in any Court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit. Section 89 bars the jurisdiction of Civil Court in respect of any matter which PPVFR Authority or Plant Variety Registrar or Plant Varieties Protection Appellate Tribunal is empowered by or under the Act to determine and Section 92 gives the provisions of the Act an overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.",

Just like the said Acts provide the term for which registration is granted and during which term only rights conferred thereunder can be protected/enforced and whereafter patent and design are in public domain, so also the PPVFR Act vide Section 24(6) thereof lays down  that the registration of a variety granted thereunder is for nine years in the case of trees and vines, extendable to a maximum of eighteen years, from the date of registration, and six years in the case of other crops, extendable for a maximum of 15 years from the date of registration. The rights conferred by the PPVFR Act, on the breeder of a plant variety, are thus a facet of intellectual property and fall in the same domain as trade marks, copyright, patents and design.",

This Court in CS(COMM) No.132/2016 titled Mosanto Technology LLC Vs. Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd. was concerned with a claim for infringement of a patent in transgenic plants having insecticidal capabilities. One of the contentions of the defendant therein while opposing the application of the plaintiff therein for interim relief was that the patent was invalid as the rights claimed by the plaintiff therein could only be under the PPVFR Act and whereunder no registration had been obtained.  Though the learned Single Judge while deciding the application for interim relief recorded that the said issue was purely legal and the suit itself could be decided on hearing thereon, but for the reason of the parties not coming forward to accept the said procedure, refrained from doing so. Vide judgment reported as Mosanto Technology LLC Vs. Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd. 239 (2017) DLT 599, while dismissing the application of the plaintiff therein for interim relief, giving some directions, it was observed that the invention subject matter of that suit patent was prima facie not the same as development of a variety within the meaning of PPVFR Act.  The Division Bench of this Court however, vide judgment reported as CS(OS) No.1163/2013 Page 10 of 36  Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd. Vs. Monsanto Technology LLC 2018 SCC OnLine Del 8326 (DB), in appeals by both the parties, held in favour of the defendant in the suit and held that since the invention was non patentable, being the subject matter of PPVFR Act and whereunder no registration existed, the suit was not maintainable and there was no need to put the same to trial; resultantly, the suit was dismissed. Supreme Court however in judgment reported as Monsanto Technology LLC Vs. Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd. (2019) 3 SCC 381 set aside the order of the Division Bench and restored the suit and the order of the Single Judge, leaving the question whether the invention subject matter of that proceeding was in the domain of the Patents Act or in the domain of PPVFR Act also to be decided post trial.",

However, in the case of Patents, a question may arise, whether an inventor has any remedy against a person who commences commercially exploiting an invention, between the dates of invention and the date of grant of patent.

Kamlekar Shantaram Wadke of Bombay (1976) 1 SCC 496 where it was held that (a) if a dispute is not an industrial dispute nor does it relate to enforcement of any right under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the remedy lies only in the Civil Court; (b) if the dispute is an industrial dispute arising out of a right or liability under the general or common law and not under the Act, the jurisdiction of the civil Court is alternative, leaving it to the election of the suitor concerned to choose his remedy for the relief which is competent to be granted; (c) only if the industrial dispute relates to the enforcement of a right or an obligation created under the Act, then the only remedy available to the suitor is to get an adjudication under the Act;  (ii)  Abhinav Gupta Vs. JCB India Ltd. 2010 (119) DRJ 397 (DB) where it was held that if a particular relief or cause of action is barred under the Information Technology Act, 2000,  it would  not mean that the plaint as a whole has to be rejected inasmuch as the plaint contains various causes of action and reliefs and if on trial it emerges that certain relief can be granted only under the Information Technology Act, then such relief may be denied and the suit may be dismissed to that extent but at the preliminary stage when issues even had not been framed, the plaint could not be rejected;  (iii)  Dhulabhai supra, laying down that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is all embracing except to the extent it is excluded by an express provision of law or by clear intendment arising from such law and that where a liability was existing at common law, and that liability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law, unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy, the party suing has his election to pursue either of the two remedies;  (iv)  The Mumbai Kamagar Sabha Bombay VS. M/s. Abdulbhai Faizullabhai AIR 1976 SC 1455 where, finding that though the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 speaks as a whole code on the subject of profit-based bonus but is silent on other distinct and different kinds of bonus such as the one oriented by custom, it was held that the Bonus Act could not annihilate by implication such different kinds of bonus;  (v)  Zee Tele. films Ltd. Vs. Sundial Communications Pvt. Ltd. 2003 (27) PTC 457 (Bom) (DB) holding that an obligation of confidence may exist where there is no contractual relationship and that it is in public interest that confidences should be respected;  (vi)  P.

Cannanore AIR 1987 Kerala 103 (FB) where a suit against the employer for compensation for injuries sustained by employer•s negligence was held maintainable as the claim was not based on any provision of the Employees• State Insurance Act, 1948;  (vii)  Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt.

Nagarajan (1988) 15 DRJ 212 holding Section 18 of the Trade Unions Act, 1926 to be not a bar to the jurisdiction of a Civil Court to grant injunction against strikes, demonstration and picketing etc. by workers;  (viii)  Belganda Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. Vs. Keshav Rajaram Patil 1994 SCC OnLine Bom 317 holding that Section 91(1) of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 was not a bar to a jurisdiction of a Civil Court to entertain a dispute arising between society and a member about a matter which does not arise out of the provisions contained in the Act and that the Act was only intended to consolidate and amend the law relating to Co-operative Societies and not for the purpose of regulating all the transactions;  (ix)  Raja Ram Kumar Bhargava Vs. Union of India (1988) 1 SCC 681 holding that wherever a right, not pre-existing in common law, is created by a statute and that statute itself provided a machinery for the enforcement of the right, both the right and the remedy having been created uno flatu and a finality having been intended to the result of the statutory proceeding, in the absence of an exclusionary provision, the civil courts• jurisdiction is impliedly barred; however if a right pre-existing in common-law is recognised by the statute and a new statutory remedy for its enforcement, without express exclusion of the civil courts• jurisdiction does not bar the civil court from entertaining the dispute; and,  (x)  Dwarka Prasad Agarwal Vs.

Registrar of Plant Varieties 2016 SCC OnLine Del 6236 was concerned with a challenge to the vires of the said Section 24(5) of the PPVFR Act inter alia on the ground that the same empowered the Registrar to injunct another, even before the applicant for registration had acquired any proprietary rights in the plant variety of which registration was sought.  It was the contention therein that it was well nigh possible that the application for registration is ultimately rejected; however the third party would stand restrained in the meanwhile .  It was further the contention that Section 24(5) of the PPVFR Act was capable of immeasurable harm and likely injury by a competitor, who by making a mere application for registration and grant of interim measure under Section 24(5), may succeed in destroying a genuinely developed plant variety whose creator or originator might be preparing a claim. Several other arguments were also raised.  The Division Bench, vide the judgment aforesaid, found merit in the challenge and has struck down Section 24(5) of the PPVFR Act, so empowering the Registrar of Plant Varieties, inter alia reasoning (i) that the process of registration begins with the submission of an application but the grant of registration or dismissal of the application for registration is after enquiry, as prescribed in the Act; (ii) however the power under Section 24(5) of the PPVFR Act is exercisable at any stage and even at the moment the application is filed, regardless of its  merits i.e. whether the applicant has any right or not; (iii) •unlike in the case of all other species of property rights, real or intellectual, the protection granted is not only wide but in respect of an entirely inchoate claim.  In a sense, the assertion by the application is at least inchoate till it was ruled or was a mere claim based upon unverified and unsubstantiated particulars in terms of the Act and the Rules•; (iv) •infringement is a matter to be determined by regular Courts•; and, (v) •given the importance of the Act, there is enormous danger in empowering authorities with unguided and uncanalized power through provisions that can implicate livelihoods and limit or impair food access to tens of thousands-potentially hundreds of thousands of farmers and users of plant variety•.",

AIR 1967 SC 1098 was concerned with a suit for injunction to restrain the employee, who had agreed to serve the employer for a fixed period, from during the said period, even after ceasing to be the employee of the plaintiff, joining employment of a competitor of the plaintiff. It was unanimously held that considerations against restrictive covenants are different in cases where the restriction is to apply during the period after the termination of the contract, than those in cases where it is to  operate during the period of contract of employment. In the facts of that case, it was found that the employee was privy to the special process invented / adopted by the plaintiff and of which the employee was trained and had acquired knowledge. The employee who had left employment prior to the contracted period was thus restrained from joining employment of a competitor for the remaining period for which he had contracted with the plaintiff in that case.",

Ltd. supra, where in the context of a claim for injunction restraining the defendants from disseminating contemporaneous match information in the form of ball by ball account or minute to minute score updates/match alerts, for a premium and without obtaining licence from plaintiff and dealing with the argument of the defendant therein unfairly competing with the plaintiff, it was held:  •10. The plaint, in my view, does not disclose any cause of action against any of the defendants on the ground of passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs. My reasons therefor are as follows:  A.  ••••.  B.  ••••.  C.  ••••.  D.  In Akutate Internet Services supra, in the context of a claim for injunction restraining the defendants from disseminating contemporaneous match information in the form of ball by ball account or minute to minute score updates/match alerts, for a premium and without obtaining licence from plaintiff, the argument of defendants unfairly competing with the plaintiffs was rejected holding (i) that in doing so, the Courts would be granting protection to certain intangibles not covered by the specific statutory regimes; (ii) the basic economic rule is that competition is not only lawful but a mainspring of the  economy; (iii) the legislature has recognized that there should be exceptions-it has laid down the rules for these; the laws of patents, trademarks, copyrights and designs have all been fashioned for the purpose; each of them have rules for their existence... each has their own justification; (iv) it is not for the judges to step in and legislate into existence new categories of intellectual property; (v) it is not open for the Courts to create such judicial remedies to remedy what the Courts consider unfair; it is not open to the Court to legislate in this way; (vi) recognition of a general action for \"unfair competition\" involves not more than recognition of the fact that the existence of such an action is inconsistent with the established limits of the traditional and statutory causes of action which are available to a trader in respect of damage caused or threatened by a competitor; those limits, which define the boundary between the area of legal or equitable restraint and protection and the area of untrammelled competition, increasingly reflect what the Parliament has determined to be the appropriate balance between competing claims and policies; (vii) neither legal principle nor social utility requires or warrants the obliteration of that boundary by the importation of cause of action whose main characteristic is the scope it allows, under high-sounding generalizations for judicial indulgence of idiosyncratic notions of what is fair in the market place; (viii) the recent trend internationally to accord protection to rights in information in varying degrees or to accept the doctrine of unfair competition, especially in the European Union,  is pursuant to legislative action by the European Council, and not as a judicial extension; (ix) once we recognize that mere information cannot be the subject matter of protection under common law, it becomes apparent that other means continue to remain available to protect such information: by way of an action for breach of the common law duty of confidence, which is a right in personam against an individual who has come across such information under confidence, and crucially, is distinct from a propriety right in such information itself, opposable in rem; (x) there exists another cogent reason for denying the existence of any general misappropriation or unfair competition theory -i.e. that it would create a non-existent distinction between copying which is actionable under the Copyright Act and appropriation or misappropriation which is actionable under the doctrine of unfair competition; (xi) under the Copyright Act, the copying or reproduction of match information is permitted; to say that the doctrine of unfair competition prohibits the misappropriation of match information would either mean that misappropriation under common law can supplant the Copyright Act or that copying and misappropriation refer to two distinct acts, which would be a distinction without a difference; (xii) claims based on alternate common law remedies in respect of what is in the domain of a statute cannot be permitted; and, (xiii) claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is the same as a claim on basis of the doctrine of unfair competition.•  It was further held:  •G. The question thus, of the plaintiffs having any rights with respect to De Simone Formulation or right of preventing the defendants from claiming their product to be the same as De Simone Formulation in which the plaintiffs have no right, does not arise.  H.  The counsel for the plaintiffs, being well conscious of the aforesaid legal position has cleverly contended that though the defendants, if had discovered invention in De Simone Formulation on their own or by way of reverse engineering, could not have been restrained by the plaintiffs from marketing and selling De Simone Formulation, but because entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs for the plaintiffs to provide Know-How of De Simone Formulation, after knowing the Know-How from the plaintiffs cannot indulge in making and marketing the product as De Simone Formulation.  I.  The aforesaid argument overlooks that the De Simone Formulation has no patent in India and the plaintiff no.1, even as inventor thereof under the Patents Act, has no right to restrain the defendants from making or selling De Simone Formulation. The question which thus emerges is, whether an invention which does not qualify as patented product and has no property right therein, can acquire property rights by the third person entering into an agreement of exchange of Know-How and thus claiming confidentiality. In my opinion, no. Reference in this regard may be made to Navigators Logistics supra wherein I have held that  confidential information and trade secrets are not equated to property in India.  J.  The said Know-How, without patent being applied for with respect thereto, was in public domain and by conduct of the defendants the status thereof cannot be changed and the same cannot be conferred rights as are permitted to be conferred under the statute i.e. Patents Act, only in accordance with the provisions thereof. The plaintiffs• case is not of enforcement of contractual rights.  K.  The counsel for the plaintiffs, as recorded in the order dated 2nd December, 2019, has also sought to contend that a patent is different from Know-How. However, Section 7 of the Patents Act titled •Form of Application• requires every patent application to be accompanied with a provisional or complete specification and Section 10 of the Act titled •Contents of Specifications• requires the specification to describe the invention sufficiently indicate in the title the subject matter to which the invention relates and to fully and particularly describe the invention and its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, the best method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and for which he is entitled to claim protection, to define the scope of the invention for which the protection is claimed, and provide technical information on the invention in the abstract. The position becomes clear from Section 25 of the Patents Act, which permits the grant of patent to be opposed on the ground of the complete specification  furnished not sufficiently and clearly describing the invention or the method by which it is to be performed. Section 84 of the Act titled •Compulsory Licences•, empowering the Controller of Patents to grant compulsory licence of patent enabling a person other than a patentee or others whom patentee has permitted to work the patent, is also indicative of patent, particularly the specifications therein, being self-sufficient to enable such person to work the patent even without the consent of the patentee. If the Know-How for manufacture of a product for which the patent has been obtained and which patent has lapsed was not proved in the specifications required to be furnished for obtaining a patent, no compulsory licence with respect to the said patent could have been granted inasmuch as compulsory licence would have been unable to work the patent without also knowing the other knowhow which the plaintiff no.1 claims to have kept to himself.  L.  In any case, information claimed to be confidential can be protected as trade secret only if such information is not available in the public domain and is hence unknown to others. Reference in this regard may again be made to Navigator Logistics supra, Ambience India Vs. Naveen Jain 122 (2005) DLT 421, Emergent Genetics Vs. Shailendra Shivam 2011 (125) DRJ 173, Tech Plus Media Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Jyoti Janda MANU/DE/2438/2014 and Satish Kumar supra. Since the plaintiffs have no subsisting patent protection in India, and since the patent based in US has expired, the innovation, as noted above, is in public domain. Hence, the claim for trade secret  protection falls and the defendants cannot be restrained from manufacturing the product, in spite of the Know-How Agreement, as otherwise it would amount to judicial creation of an extra-statutory monopoly for perpetuity in the invention, in contrast to the scheme of Patent Act, 1970 that seeks to bring an invention to public domain after the expiry of the term of the patent, and which is opposed to public interest as well as to judicial discipline.•",

Banarsi Dass Goela AIR 1980 Delhi 254; (v) business goodwill is an asset and species of „property‟; the tort of passing off is based on economic policy, the need to encourage enterprise and to ensure commercial stability; reliance is placed on Prina Chemical Works Vs. Sukhdayal ILR 1974 Delhi 545; (vi) Section 4 of the Specific Relief Act extends to enforcing a right of a party to goodwill and reputation enjoyed by its product; (vii) the mala fide of the defendants is also evident from the defendants using the mark, earlier used with respect to a drug, now with respect to a food supplement; (viii) such action of the defendants is harmful for the public and is in violation of the notification issued by the DCGI and filed at page 695 of Part-IIIA file; (ix) even otherwise the new product is being sold under the mark VSL#3 in USA as a medical food whereas the same is being sold as a food supplement in India under the same mark; (x) the plaintiffs, in US Courts had not made grievance with respect to use of the mark VSL#3 by the defendants but only with respect to reliance by the defendants on the studies relating to De Simone Formulation and which grievance has been sustained and the defendants restrained from relying on such studies or from trying to draw a nexus of their new product  with De Simone Formulation; (xi) the defendants, in India also are relying on the studies relating to De Simone Formulation and which is harmful to consumers interest; and, (xii) the plaintiffs here not only have a prima facie case but a strong prima facie case, justifying not only admission of the suit but also grant of ex parte ad-interim injunction; reliance is placed on Mohan Rawale Vs. Damodar Tatyaba Alias Dadasaheb (1994) 2 SCC 392 to contend that the mere fact that the case is weak, is no ground for striking it out so long as some cause of action is disclosed.",

                        "content": "The plaint, in my view, does not disclose any cause of action against any of the defendants on the ground of passing off their goods as that of the plaintiffs. My reasons therefor are as follows:  A.  The plaintiffs‟ claim De Simone Formulation, passing off whereof by the defendants is alleged, to be a patented product. However, the patent pleaded with respect to De Simone Formulation is under the laws of USA and it is not the case of the plaintiffs that De Simone Formulation had any patent in India.  B.  Unlike the intellectual property in trade marks, where the common law tort of passing off is statutorily recognized vide Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, there is no common law right in an invention, as the plaintiffs claim De Simone Formulation to be. It is only by statute i.e. the Patents Act, 1970, that to give impetus to research and innovation, rights in  an invention are conferred but again unlike trade marks, for a limited period of time. It is only when a patent has been obtained with respect to an invention in accordance with the Patents Act that the inventor or the patentee entitled to prevent others, who do not have his consent, from the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the patented product or from using the patented process. Save as conferred by Section 48 of the Patents Act, there is no right in common law in any inventor to restrain others from commercially exploiting the invention.  C.  Reference in this regard may be made, to Entertainment Network Vs. Super Cassette Industries (2008) 13 SCC 30, Times Warner Entertainment Company Vs. RPG Netcomm 140 (2007) DLT 758 (DB), The Gramophone Company of India Vs. Super Cassette Industries ILR (2010) Supp. (5) Delhi 656, Super Cassettes Industries Ltd. Vs. Chintaman Rao MANU/DE/4400/2011, Akutate Internet Services Vs. Star India 2013 SCC OnLine Del 3344 (DB), Navigators Logistics Vs. Kashif Qureshi 254 (2018) DLT 307, Satish Kumar Vs. Khushboo Singh MANU/DE/3411/2019 holding that there is no right under the common law or otherwise of copyright save as provided within the four corners of Copyright Act, 1957; to Carlsberg Breweries A/S Vs. Som Distilleries and Breweries Ltd. AIR 2019 Del 23 (FB) and Crocs Inc. USA Vs. Aqualite India Limited 2019 SCC OnLine Del 7409 (appeal  whereagainst is pending) holding that a registered design confers on the registrant, only the right to restrain another from infringing the design and not to, also claiming the registered design as its trade mark/trade dress, restrain another from passing off its goods as that of registrant, by copying the registered design; and to Bristol-Myers Squibb Holdings Ireland Unlimited Company Vs. Natco Pharma 2020 SCC OnLine Del 200 holding that there is no right in any invention save in accordance with the Patents Act. Justice Ayyangar Committee Report on the Revision of Patent Laws notes that the rules and regulations of patent systems are not governed by common law, which has been taken note of subsequently in Novartis AG Vs. Union of India (2013) 6 SCC 1 by the Supreme Court. The intellectual property of copyright, designs and patents, unlike of trade marks, is purely and simply a statutory right and there are no rights including claims in tort of unfair competition or unjust enrichment, in intellectual properties of literary and art work or design or invention save as provided under the respective statutory regimes of Copyright Act, Designs Act and the Patents Act.  D.  In Akutate Internet Services supra, in the context of a claim for injunction restraining the defendants from disseminating contemporaneous match information in the form of ball by ball account or minute to minute score updates/match alerts, for a premium and without obtaining licence from plaintiff, the  argument of defendants unfairly competing with the plaintiffs was rejected holding (i) that in doing so, the Courts would be granting protection to certain intangibles not covered by the specific statutory regimes; (ii) the basic economic rule is that competition is not only lawful but a mainspring of the economy; (iii) the legislature has recognized that there should be exceptions-it has laid down the rules for these; the laws of patents, trademarks, copyrights and designs have all been fashioned for the purpose; each of them have rules for their existence... each has their own justification; (iv) it is not for the judges to step in and legislate into existence new categories of intellectual property; (v) it is not open for the Courts to create such judicial remedies to remedy what the Courts consider unfair; it is not open to the Court to legislate in this way; (vi) recognition of a general action for \"unfair competition\" involves not more than recognition of the fact that the existence of such an action is inconsistent with the established limits of the traditional and statutory causes of action which are available to a trader in respect of damage caused or threatened by a competitor; those limits, which define the boundary between the area of legal or equitable restraint and protection and the area of untrammelled competition, increasingly reflect what the Parliament has determined to be the appropriate balance between competing claims and policies; (vii) neither legal principle nor social utility requires or warrants the obliteration of that boundary by the importation of cause of  Copyright Act  under the Copyright Act,  action whose main characteristic is the scope it allows, under high-sounding generalizations for judicial indulgence of idiosyncratic notions of what is fair in the market place; (viii) the recent trend internationally to accord protection to rights in information in varying degrees or to accept the doctrine of unfair competition, especially in the European Union, is pursuant to legislative action by the European Council, and not as a judicial extension; (ix) once we recognize that mere information cannot be the subject matter of protection under common law, it becomes apparent that other means continue to remain available to protect such information: by way of an action for breach of the common law duty of confidence, which is a right in personam against an individual who has come across such information under confidence, and crucially, is distinct from a propriety right in such information itself, opposable in rem; (x) there exists another cogent reason for denying the existence of any general misappropriation or unfair competition theory -i.e. that it would create a non-existent distinction between copying which is actionable under the and appropriation or misappropriation which is actionable under the doctrine of unfair competition; (xi) the copying or reproduction of match information is permitted; to say that the doctrine of unfair competition prohibits the misappropriation of match information would either mean that misappropriation under common law can supplant the (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1136195/>)Copyright Act or that copying  and misappropriation refer to two distinct acts, which would be a distinction without a difference; (xii) claims based on alternate common law remedies in respect of what is in the domain of a statute cannot be permitted; (xiii) claim on the basis of unjust enrichment is the same as a claim on basis of the doctrine of unfair competition; and, (xiv) the claim for unjust enrichment involves the same conduct that would fall under the Copyright Act.  E.  I have in Modicare Limited supra held that (i) Section 27 of the Contract Act makes void i.e. unenforceable, every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind; (ii) it is incongruous that the law, on the one hand would disable a plaintiff from enforcing a contract where the defendant had voluntarily agreed not to do something, by going to the extent of declaring such contract void, but on the other hand, enable the same plaintiff to the same relief under the law of tort; to hold so, would make the law look like an ass; (iii) Section 27 has been held to have been enacted as a matter of public policy of India, and does not create any personal right, which can be waived; if it is the public policy of India that there can be no restraint on any one exercising a lawful profession, trade or business, not even when such person has voluntarily agreed not to, it belies logic that such public policy would not apply when the mischief sought to be prevented is sought to be practiced invoking law of torts;  (iv)  what is not contractually enforceable is also not enforceable invoking law of torts; (v) while under the common law in England, restraints of trade, whether general or partial, may be good if they are reasonable or reasonably necessary with reference to public policy or for protection of interest of covenantee, in India, agreements in restraint of trade are governed by Section 27 and the question of reasonableness of restraint is outside the purview of Section 27—this explains, the law of tort of unlawful interference in business, in UK; (vi) however the same has no place in India; (vii) principles of English Law cannot be imported once the Parliament has codified the said principles in the Contract Act; it is the language of the statute which alone has to be considered to ascertain its true meaning and scope; (viii) Section 27, on promulgation of the Constitution of India, conferring the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, the status of a Fundamental Right, under Article 19(1)(g) thereof, today has a different connotation; (ix) Article 19(6) only clarifies that nothing contained in Clause (g) shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any law, imposing in the interest of general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of right conferred by the said clause; (x) thus, restrictions, in the interest of general public and if reasonable, to the Fundamental Right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, can be imposed only by law; (xi) the law of tort of  unreasonable interference in carrying on business, in view of Section 27 of the Contract Act, was not the existing law within the meaning of Article 19 (6) of the Constitution; (xii) the right saved by Section 27 is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.  F.  As is evident from the plaint, and the written submission presented on behalf of the plaintiffs, patent has not been sought in regard to De Simone Formulation in India and the US based patent has expired, in which context a passing off claim sans patent protection, in any case, cannot be entertained by the Court. Reference in this regard can be made to The Canadian Shreddeo Wheat Company Vs. The Kellogg Company of Canada Limited AIR 1938 PC 143.  G.  The question thus, of the plaintiffs having any rights with respect to De Simone Formulation or right of preventing the defendants from claiming their product to be the same as De Simone Formulation in which the plaintiffs have no right, does not arise.  H.  The counsel for the plaintiffs, being well conscious of the aforesaid legal position has cleverly contended that though the defendants, if had discovered invention in De Simone Formulation on their own or by way of reverse engineering, could not have been restrained by the plaintiffs from marketing and selling De Simone Formulation, but because entered into  an agreement with the plaintiffs for the plaintiffs to provide Know-How of De Simone Formulation, after knowing the Know-How from the plaintiffs cannot indulge in making and marketing the product as De Simone Formulation.  I.  The aforesaid argument overlooks that the De Simone Formulation has no patent in India and the plaintiff no.1, even as inventor thereof under the Patents Act, has no right to restrain the defendants from making or selling De Simone Formulation. The question which thus emerges is, whether an invention which does not qualify as patented product and has no property right therein, can acquire property rights by the third person entering into an agreement of exchange of Know-How and thus claiming confidentiality. In my opinion, no. Reference in this regard may be made to Navigators Logistics supra wherein I have held that confidential information and trade secrets are not equated to property in India.  J.  The said Know-How, without patent being applied for with respect thereto, was in public domain and by conduct of the defendants the status thereof cannot be changed and the same cannot be conferred rights as are permitted to be conferred under the statute i.e. Patents Act, only in accordance with the provisions thereof. The plaintiffs‟ case is not of enforcement of contractual rights.  K.  The counsel for the plaintiffs, as recorded in the order dated 2nd December, 2019, has also sought to contend that a patent is different from Know-How. However, Section 7 of the Patents Act titled “Form of Application” requires every patent application to be accompanied with a provisional or complete specification and Section 10 of the Act titled “Contents of Specifications” requires the specification to describe the invention sufficiently indicate in the title the subject matter to which the invention relates and to fully and particularly describe the invention and its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, the best method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and for which he is entitled to claim protection, to define the scope of the invention for which the protection is claimed, and provide technical information on the invention in the abstract. The position becomes clear from Section 25 of the Patents Act, which permits the grant of patent to be opposed on the ground of the complete specification furnished not sufficiently and clearly describing the invention or the method by which it is to be performed. Section 84 of the Act titled “Compulsory Licences”, empowering the Controller of Patents to grant compulsory licence of patent enabling a person other than a patentee or others whom patentee has permitted to work the patent, is also indicative of patent, particularly the specifications therein, being self-sufficient to enable such person to work the patent even without the consent of the  patentee. If the Know-How for manufacture of a product for which the patent has been obtained and which patent has lapsed was not proved in the specifications required to be furnished for obtaining a patent, no compulsory licence with respect to the said patent could have been granted inasmuch as compulsory licence would have been unable to work the patent without also knowing the other knowhow which the plaintiff no.1 claims to have kept to himself.  L.  In any case, information claimed to be confidential can be protected as trade secret only if such information is not available in the public domain and is hence unknown to others.  Reference in this regard may again be made to Navigator Logistics supra, Ambience India Vs. Naveen Jain 122 (2005) DLT 421, Emergent Genetics Vs. Shailendra Shivam 2011 (125) DRJ 173, Tech Plus Media Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Jyoti Janda 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1819 and Satish Kumar supra. Since the plaintiffs have no subsisting patent protection in India, and since the patent based in US has expired, the innovation, as noted above, is in public domain. Hence, the claim for trade secret protection falls and the defendants cannot be restrained from manufacturing the product, in spite of the Know-How Agreement, as otherwise it would amount to judicial creation of an extra-statutory monopoly for perpetuity in the invention, in contrast to the scheme of Patent Act, 1970 that seeks to bring an invention to public domain after the expiry of the term of the  patent, and which is opposed to public interest as well as to judicial discipline.  M.  The plaintiff has also sought to restrain the defendants from selling their product under the brand name VSL#3. In this regard, however, it is pertinent to note that the averments in the plaint make it clear that the brand name VSL#3 is owned by defendant No.2. The passing off claim with regard to the brand name by the plaintiff is unfounded as the restraint on use is sought with respect to property that the plaintiffs do not own in the first instance.  N.  No merit is thus found in the contention of the counsel for the plaintiffs, of any separate property right, besides the patent, for working the patent.  O.  Once the plaintiff no.1, as far as India is concerned, had no right in De Simone Formulation without obtaining patent with respect thereto, the question of the plaintiff being entitled to restrain the defendants from working the De Simone Formulation or from claiming their product to be the same as De Simone Formulation does not arise. The claim of the plaintiffs of the defendants by so misrepresenting causing injury to the public is in public interest and without any personal right, the plaintiffs have no personal cause of action. If the plaintiffs are desirous of instituting a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) and are entitled to do so as per the Rules of this  Court, the plaintiffs will have to apply in a public interest forum in accordance with the rules of this Court.  P.  The reliefs claimed of permanent injunction are governed by the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and fall in the genre of specific relief. Section 4 of the said Act provides that specific relief can be granted only for the purpose of enforcing individual civil rights and not for the mere purpose of enforcing a penal law.  Once the plaintiffs have not been able to show any individual civil right in their favour, to be entitled to restrain the defendants from breaching the same, the question of the plaintiffs being entitled to the relief of injunction, thus does not arise.",
