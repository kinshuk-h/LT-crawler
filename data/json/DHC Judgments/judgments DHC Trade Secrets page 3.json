The reason probably is in today’s world of globalization, where competition is at its peak, the organizations may not be inclined to disclose trade secrets/confidential agreements or its details, it had entered with different parties lest may cause serious prejudice to such parties because of competition involved. A trade secrets may make or break a company hence need to be protected. Once such disclosure is made or is misused by a competitor no order of the Court can save the company from loss or could retrieve it to its original position. Even the Patrick McKillen (supra) para 41 notes:  “41. In patent and similar cases it may be necessary to limit severely the officers or employees of a party who may have access to the evidence.”",

He states that the order passed by this Court on February 12, 2020, is primarily relying upon the order dated April 25, 2016, wherein in para 227, this Court had referred to the order passed in CS(OS) 355/2014, which permitted the inspection to be carried out by the Advocates / expert from the plaintiff’s side. According to him, a reading of para 135 of the said order, as reproduced in the order dated February 12, 2020 clearly reflects that the intention of the Court allowing the inspection on behalf of the plaintiff by two Advocates / expert is to include the in-house expert. In fact, it is his submission that this Court had granted liberty to the plaintiffs, after inspection, to amend its pleadings, if so required, which is possible if an internal expert is allowed to inspect the documents.  He also states that even assuming, an external expert is only allowed to inspect the documents, in that eventuality, if the pleadings are required to be amended, the same shall be possible if that external expert divulges to the plaintiffs, the contents of the documents, so inspected. In fact, he has relied upon the judgment of the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Transformative learning Solutions Pvt. Ltd. vs. Pawajot Kaur Baweja & ors. CS(COMM) 817/2018 decided on July 17, 2019, more specifically paras 21 to 23 to contend, if the plaintiff is not allowed to inspect the documents of the defendants then the plaintiff would be unable to establish its claim in the suit.",

The answer to this issue can be found only in the order dated April 25, 2016, more specifically para 227, wherein this Court had referred to an order passed in the earlier suit being CS(OS) 355/2014. A reading of para 135 clearly shows that this Court has not limited the expert to be an external expert. If the Court meant that way, it would have said so. Further, the other part of the order, where a liberty has been granted by this Court for amending the pleadings is only possible, if the plaintiffs are represented by an internal expert, who can help in the amendment of the pleadings in the manner required. That apart, Mr. Wadhwa is right, in stating that even if inspection is carried out by an external expert, still he has to divulge the information acquired from the documents to enable the plaintiff carry out the amendments  to establish its claim in the suit. Otherwise, inspection shall loose its relevance, if the outcome of the same is not utilized purposefully by the party, which sought the inspection. I have been told that this order, which was taken in appeal, was not pressed by the applicant. In fact, the said order having attained finality cannot now be rewritten at the asking of the applicant. In fact, the grant of prayer of the applicant in this application shall have a bearing on the order already passed in CS(OS) 355/2014.",

In fact, during the arguments, the counsels have made allegations against the other party to say that the other party contends otherwise. I am not concerned with the issue whether the suit is a commercial suit or not. Suffice would it be to state on the nomenclature given to the suit, it is not a commercial suit. In any case, I find that the principles akin to Rule 17 have been made applicable to the case in hand, as is clear from the reading of the order dated April 25, 2016, which incorporate the order passed in CS(OS) 355/2014, inasmuch as the court has directed the constitution of a Confidentiality Club, the Members of which shall be bound by the confidentiality. So, the plea of Mr. Lall by relying upon Rule 17 is inconsequential. In fact, I find the order dated April 25, 2016 and the order passed by this Court in CS(OS) 817/2018 wherein in paras 21 to 23, the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court has held as under, are on similar lines.  “21.

I may mention that the suit has been filed as a commercial suit and not as an ordinary suit. This suit, under Section 2(c) of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, can qualify as a commercial suit only if arising out of intellectual property rights relating to trade marks, copyright, patent, design etc. and not if arising out of property rights or a tort. In such a suit, to ask the defendants to contest the suit without knowing the customers list in which copyright is claimed and without knowing what they are sought to be restrained from doing, would not only be unfair to the defendants but also would be contrary to procedure prescribed by law. The Advocates of defendants and experts, even if any possible in such scenario, cannot be expected to make pleadings, to  meet the case of plaintiffs. The non disclosure to the defendant sought by the plaintiffs, in my opinion deprives the defendant of opportunity of being heard and the right to defend the suit.”",

A plaintiff, when filing a suit, specially a commercial suit, ought to take care to plead its case properly in the plaint and produce all documents sought to be relied on along with the plaint. In this context it has been observed in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Vs. Saregama India Ltd. 2019 SCC OnLine Del 10215 as under:- “13. The changes brought about by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 in respect of filing of documents having already been discussed in Nitin Gupta Vs. Texmaco Infrastructure and Holding Limited 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8367 and Societe Des Produits Nestle S.A. Vs. Essar Industries 2016 SCC OnLine Del 42, need to reiterate the same is not felt. Suffice it is to state that:  (a)  while  Order VII Rule 14 of the CPC, applicable to ordinary suits, requires a plaintiff, when suing upon a document or relying upon documents in his possession or power in support of his claim, to enter such documents in a list and to produce it in the Court when the plaint is presented by him,  Order XI Rules 1 to 3 of the CPC as applicable to commercial suits requires a plaintiff to file a list of all documents and photocopies of all documents in its power, possession, control or custody, pertaining to the suit,  along with the plaint including documents relating to any matter in question in the proceedings, in the power, possession, control or custody of the plaintiff, as on the date of filing the plaint, irrespective of whether the same is in support of or adverse to the plaintiff‟s case and to, in the said list also specify whether the documents in the power, possession, control or custody of the plaintiff are originals, office copies or photocopies and the list to also set out in brief, details of parties to each document, mode of execution, issuance or receipt and line of custody of each document; the plaint is also required to contain a declaration on oath from the plaintiff that all documents in the power, possession, control or custody of the plaintiff, pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings initiated by him have been disclosed and copies thereof annexed with the plaint, and that the plaintiff does not have any other documents in its power, possession, control or custody;  (b)  while  Order VII Rule 14(3) of the CPC pertaining to ordinary suits provides that a document which ought to be produced in Court by the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered in the list to be added or annexed to the plaint, but is not produced or entered accordingly, such document, without the leave of the Court, shall not be received in evidence on behalf of the plaintiff at the hearing of the suit,  Order XI Rule 1(5) pertaining to commercial suits, bars the Court from allowing the plaintiff to rely on documents which were in the plaintiff‟s power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with the plaint, save and except by leave of the Court and which leave shall be granted only upon the plaintiff establishing requisite cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint.  It would thus be seen that the requirement for filing of documents along with the plaint is much more detailed, precise and specific in a commercial suit than in an  ordinary suit. The plaintiff in an ordinary suit is required to produce along with the plaint only such documents on which he is suing or on which he intends to rely in support of his claim. On the contrary, in a commercial suit, the plaintiff along with the plaint is required to file all documents pertaining to the suit irrespective of, whether the same are in support of or adverse to the claim of the plaintiff. The list of documents required to be filed by a plaintiff in an ordinary suit is only required to have an entry of the document. On the contrary, the list of documents required to be filed by a plaintiff in a commercial suit is required to specify, whether the documents are originals or office copies or photocopies and also contain details of parties to each document, mode of execution and line of custody of each document. The plaint in a commercial suit is also required to contain a declaration on oath from the plaintiff with respect to the documents, as aforesaid. There is no such requirement in the ordinary suit.",

                        "content": "What emerges is, that the plaintiff in a commercial suit, before instituting the suit, is required to go through all the documents in his power, possession, control or custody pertaining to the subject matter of the suit, whether in support of or adverse to his case and make a declaration with respect thereto on oath. The requirement in a commercial suit of declaration on oath qua the documents is not an empty formality. The form of list of documents and the particulars/specifications to be contained therein, coupled with declaration on oath with respect thereto, in a commercial suit, requires a plaintiff to, at the time of institution of suit, rather than stating only the title and date of the document, which alone is required to be filled in the list of documents in an ordinary suit, peruse each document and only then fill the particulars/specifications required to be filled in the list of documents. The requirement of such contents being declared to be correct on oath, places a more heavy onus on the plaintiff.",

The Legislature has not laid down the grounds on which such leave is to be granted. I have however in Nitin Gupta supra held that grant of such leave by the Court is not a ministerial function and the Court has to be satisfied qua the reasons for non-production of the documents along with the plaint. The same however places no restriction on the power of the Court to grant such leave. As distinct therefrom, under Order XI Rule 1(5) as applicable to commercial suits, there is an embargo on the Court, not to allow the plaintiff to rely on any document which was in plaintiff‟s power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with the plaint. The disclosure under Rules 1(1) & (2) has to be accompanied with listing and filing of the documents. The said embargo placed on the Court can be lifted only upon the plaintiff establishing reasonable cause for non-disclosure along with the plaint. The use of the word „establishing‟ conveys that there should be something more than a mere explanation for non-production along with plaint, amounting to proof of the explanation.”",

In this context, it may be also mentioned that using such high-sounding/phrases which in fact have no content or meaning, a large number of suits are filed in this Court against the ex-employees and it has often been found that interim injunctions issued restraining the ex-employees from divulging the same to any other person remain unenforceable in the absence of particulars and with applications under Order XXXIX Rule 2A of the CPC being filed with respect to all communications made by such employees with others and with it being absolutely impossible for the Court to determine whether the communication is in violation of the interim order. It is for this reason only that Section 41(f) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and principles whereof are applicable to temporary injunctions also, prohibits grant of injunction to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a nuisance. Similarly, without specifying the information, disclosure of which is sought to be restrained, an injunction cannot be granted; rather I have wondered the purport of the interim order dated 3rd June, 2016 in this suit, restraining the defendants from utilizing, exploiting, copying, transmitting, publishing or releasing any confidential information and trade secrets of the plaintiff to any entity for any purpose whatsoever, without specifying as to which is that confidential information and trade secret.

Burlington Home Shopping Pvt. Ltd. and Diljeet Titus, Advocate supra were noticed but it was further held (i) that both the said judgments are of a date prior to the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Eastern Book Company Vs. D.B. Modak (2008) 1 SCC 1, laying down (i) that to claim copyright in a compilation, the author must produce the material with exercise of his skill and judgment which may not be creativity in the sense that it is novel or non-obvious but at the same time it is not a product merely of labour and capital; and, (ii) that the exercise of skill and judgment required to produce the work must not be so trivial that it could be characterized as a purely mechanical exercise. Accordingly, it  was held that copy edited judgments would not satisfy the copyright merely by establishing amount of skill, labour and capital put in the inputs of the copy edited judgments as the original or innovative thoughts for the creativity are completely excluded. Notice in Tech Plus Media Private Ltd. was also taken of Emergent Genetics India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Shailendra Shivam 2011 (47) PTC 494.

It was held that no copyright subsists therein in the absence of employment of any skill judgment and labour in compilation thereof. It was further held that without specifically averring as to the manner/technique/criteria employed in such sequencing/collection and the originality in the same, the plaintiff could not succeed in its claim. It was yet further held that the compilation in that case was a derivative work in the sense of being a collection of sequencing of already existing information and did not satisfy the standard of creativity required to qualify as a work in which copyright subsists. It was explained that the standard of creativity required in such derivative work is higher than the standard required in cases of primary works.

The plaintiff claims ownership of copyright under Section 17 of the Act, presumably under clause (c) thereof. However, the plaintiff has not disclosed the name of the author, who was employed with the plaintiff. The plaintiff, which is a company, cannot be the author. This Court in Rupendra Kashyap Vs. Jiwan Publishing House Pvt.

I also, in Tech Plus Media Private Ltd. supra have held that a juristic person is incapable of being the author of any literary work in which a copyright may exist, though may be owner of copyright. The plaintiff has not disclosed the identity of author. The plaintiff does not claim any confidentiality about such identity.

Just like customers/clients of an Advocate practicing in the field of acquisition of land and determination of compensation therefor can comprise only of those whose land has been acquired and whose particulars are contained in the acquisition notification and/or award pronounced by the Land Acquisition Collector, similarly the list of customers/clients of the plaintiff, carrying on business in the field of logistic and freight forwarding, can only comprise of businesses/industry requiring carriage of goods and material and none else. Names and contact addresses of such businesses are easily available in public domain. Any competitor of the plaintiff worth its salt would also know of such businesses/industry and be free to market his services to them, even if presently employing the service of the plaintiff. I am thus unable to fathom the confidentiality therein and during the hearing also repeatedly enquired about the same and also enquired about the particulars of other works/databases and in which also copyright and confidentiality was claimed. No answer was forthcoming. Every customer list cannot qualify as confidential information or a trade secret unless the confidentiality around such a list is of economic value/business value/commercial value. A thought  also crossed my mind, whether not any employee of the plaintiff, dealing with the customers/clients of the plaintiff on behalf of the plaintiff, would have knowledge of the said customers/clients and their contact address even in the absence of a list and how could such an employee, when joining the employment of a competitor, be prevented from marketing the services of the competitor to the employees/clients at the address on which he was earlier servicing them under employment of the former employer and whether not it would amount to restraint of trade.",

It was reasoned, that if the competitor bank without acquiring any information as to with whom a particular person or company is banking, can approach him and canvass about themselves, even after acquiring information that a particular person of company is banking with a bank is still entitled to approach him and canvass about themselves and it is for the customers to decide with which bank to bank.

Georgia Pacific Corporation and Timothy L. Cornwell 31 USPQ 2d1472 and Kodekay Electronics Inc. Vs. Mechanex Corp. 486 F. 2d 449 (10th Cir. 1973) and held that something which is known outside the business or to those inside the business i.e. the employees and for guarding which no steps have been taken and for developing which no effort or money has been extended, cannot be a trade secret. Accordingly, it was held that information relating to „strategic business plans‟, „product mix‟, „square footage of construction‟, „capital expenditure‟ or „revenue budgets‟ could not be claimed to be of any confidential nature which no other competitor would know. Relying on Star India Private Limited supra it was held that a salesman leaving a company and heart surgeon leaving a hospital cannot be prevented from negotiating with the customers or performing a surgery on the premise that they acquired the skill by experience and those skills can be carried with the employee. It was yet further held that though the defendant in that case, on amassing information and knowledge with regard to the plaintiff‟s plan of operation, could not be injuncted from disclosing those plans to the competitor if he carried them in his head and the competitor in the market, could not be taken to be driven by the defendant‟s disclosure alone.",

Section 27 of the Contract Act makes void i.e. unenforceable, every agreement by which anyone is restrained from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind. Thus, even if the defendants or any of them, under their agreement with the plaintiff, had undertaken not to carry on or be involved in any capacity in any business competing with the business of the plaintiff, even after leaving employment with/association of the plaintiff, the said agreement, owing to Section 27 supra, would be void and unenforceable and the plaintiff on the basis thereof could not have restrained any of the defendants from carrying on any business or vocation, even if the one which the defendant had agreed not to carry on. I find it incongruous that the law, on the one hand would disable a plaintiff from enforcing a contract where the defendant had voluntarily agreed not to do something, by going to the extent of declaring such contract void, but on the other hand, enable the  same plaintiff to the same relief under the law of tort. To hold so, would make the law look like an ass.",

If it is the public policy of India that there can be no restraint on any one exercising a lawful profession, trade or business, not even when such person has voluntarily agreed not to, it belies logic that such public policy would not apply when the mischief sought to be prevented is sought to be practiced invoking law of torts.

Any new entrant in the market, to be able to create a niche for itself, in spite of the existing players, has to compete with the existing players, by approaching the same customers and the same cache of employees who over the years have acquired expertise in that particular field. When launching the same product/service, the new entrant to the business cannot possibly create a new set of customers for that product or service. Thus, the consumers to  be approached by the new entrant would be the same who were earlier having contractual relationships with the existing players. Similarly, a new entrant cannot possibly compete if does not have the requisite expertise/finesse, required for launching a particular product or service and to be able to provide the same class or quality of service, has to necessarily have with it, hands which have been making the subject product and/or providing the said service in the past, may be under contract with the existing players. In my view, it is practically impossible to draw a line between such persons, on their own approaching the new entrant, and the new entrant approaching them. The process is quite complex and no precise rules can be made with respect thereto. The Courts would not lay down the law in the name of being a matter of evidence, in respect of matters which are incapable of determination by Courts.",

The Assessing Officer (AO) adjudged the Appellant to fulfill the conditions assigned to a “dealer” under the DSTRTUG Act, 2002. Further citing the case of Vikas Sales Corporation v. CCT (1996) 102 STC 106 SC, the Supreme Court had ruled that trade marks are goods, and that for transferring the right to use, a trade mark, being intangible goods it is not necessary to hand over the trade mark to the transferee or give control or possession to him, but that transfer is achieved or complete by merely authorizing the transferee to use the trade mark in the manner required by law; the AO held that the charging of royalty relates to the transfer of the right to use of a patent or trade mark. It was held, inter alia, in Vikas Sales (supra) that:  “21.The above material uniformly emphasises the expansive manner in which the expression property'' is understood. Learned counsel for the petitioners brought to our, notice the meanings of the term property\" set out in Chapter-13, \"The Law of Property\", in Salmond's Jurisprudence (12th Edition, 1966) In this chapter, several meanings attributed to \"property\" are discussed in extenso ; to all of which it may not be necessary to refer, Suffice to say that property is defined to include material things and immaterial things (jura in re propria) and leases; servitudes and securities etc ( jura in -re aliena). The material things are said to comprise land and chattels while immaterial things include patents, copyrights and trade marks, which along with leases, servitudes and securities are described as incorporeal property The expression \"movable property\" is stated to include (Page 421) corporeal as well as incorporeal property, Debts, contracts and other chose-in-action are said to be chattels, no less than furniture or stock-in-trade, Similarly, patents, copyrights and other rights in rem which are not rights over land are also included within the meaning of movable property; We are unable to see anything in the said Chapter-13, which militates against the meanings ascribed to the said expression in the judicial dictionaries referred have above., indeed, they are consistent with each other.”",

                        "content": "The Appellant had cited Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Duke and Sons Private Limited (112) STC 370, where the Supreme Court had held that it is not necessary to hand over the trade mark to the transferee for give control or possession to him, and that it can be done by merely authorizing the transferee to use the same in the manner required by law. Thus, going by the above reasoning, the AO held the “McDonald‟s system” which includes proprietary rights in valuable trade names, service marks and trade marks etc., to fall within the definition of “goods” under the DSTRTUG Act, 2002. As such, since the goods were thus property having its proprietary rights transferred with a right to use; they were held to fall within the definition of  “sale” under Section 2(n) of the DSTRTUG Act, 2002 and McDonald‟s had transferred the goods in the shape of goodwill attached with the use of trade mark and the service portion, if any, is incidental to the transfer of trade mark. The AO framed the assessment demand at ` 13,44,684/-. The Joint Commissioner, i.e the appellate authority, rejected McDonald‟s plea after undertaking an analysis of the provisions of the DSTRTUG Act, 2002, and the relevant clauses of the Master License Agreement. He concluded that the “McDonald‟s system” comprised incorporeal intellectual property. The appellate authority referred to the Supreme Court judgments of M/s. Vikas Sales Corporation (supra) and M/s Sunrise Associates v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi AIR 2006 SC 1908, to highlight how the franchise agreement has all the attributes of a license and, therefore, transactions covered by the said agreement are taxable under Section 3 of the DSTRTUG Act and, that the nature of the “McDonald‟s system” (as examined in the light of Section 2(1)(f) of the DSTRTUG Act) falls under the definition of “goods”.",

The Tribunal also held that the McDonald‟s systems fulfills the criteria to qualify as “goods”, as laid down in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd v. Union of India (2006) 3 SCC 1 (hereafter “BSNL”). Highlighting SPS Jayam and Co. v. Registrar (2004) 137 STC 117 (Mad.) it was further noted that merely because the assessee retained the right for himself to use the trade mark and reserves the right to grant permission to others to use the trade mark, the character of the transaction as one of transfer of a right to use could not be denied. The Tribunal rejected the appellant‟s contention that a composite contract of service cannot be split up to tax transfer of the right to use goods, and that the permission to use the trade mark is merely incidental to the bunch of services being provided under the MLA; thereby, there being no transfer of any right to use under any enactment. It held that the appellant is providing service to self with the sole aim of protecting its own interests, and that the service component arising from the MLA is merely incidental to the main activity of transfer of right to use the McDonald‟s system, as was similarly held in Nutrine Confectionery Co. (P) Ltd v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2011) 11 VST B-386 (AP).",

Relevant clauses from the franchise agreement between Bikanerwala and Sagar Ratna and their franchisees are relied on to say that there was no intention to transfer the right to use the  goods (i.e the trade marks or intellectual property).",

Relying on BSNL v. Union of India (supra) McDonald‟s contended that there can be no overlapping of service tax and sales tax/VAT levy. Counsel also highlighted the basic attributes that constitute the transfer of the right to use goods. In the concurring decision of Dr. A.R. Lakshmanan, J (in BSNL) it was held as follows:  “96. To constitute a transaction for the transfer of the right to use the goods the transaction must have the following attributes:  a.  There must be goods available for delivery;  b.  There must be a consensus ad idem as to the identity of the goods;  c.  The transferee should have a legal right to use the goods – consequently all legal consequences of such use including any permissions or licenses required therefore should be available to the transferee;  d.  For the period during which the transferee has such legal right, it has to be the exclusion to the transferor -this is the necessary concomitant of the plain language of the statute -viz. a \"transfer of the right to use\" and not merely a licence to use the goods;  e.  Having transferred the right to use the goods during the period for which it is to be transferred, the owner cannot again transfer the same rights to others.”  Thus, it was contended how the franchise agreement only permits the use of “McDonald‟s system” but there is no transfer of any right to use the trade mark.",

Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel lastly relied on Section 48 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 (“the Trade Marks Act” hereafter) and argued that use of the mark by a permitted user is not considered to be grant of any property right and in fact, such use inures to the benefit of the Intellectual  Property proprietor.

The following passage of the judgment was cited:  “We do not think that in BSNL the Supreme Court intended to prescribe a test of global or universal application without regard to individual circumstances. The judgment of the Supreme Court (in paragraph 90) notes the factual aspects. There, the entire infrastructure, instruments, appliances and exchange remained in the physical control and possession of the petitioner at all times and there was neither any physical transfer of such goods nor any transfer of the right to use such equipment or apparatuses. One of the issues that arose for consideration was whether there was any transfer of the right to use goods by providing access or a telephone connection by  the telephone service provider to a subscriber. This BSNL test, was, therefore, set out in these circumstances. The Court had no occasion to consider its applicability to intangible property like intellectual property. This is how BSNL has been interpreted by us in Tata Sons. We think that this interpretation is correct. In any case, it binds us. The Kerala High Court in Malabar Gold, in paragraph 35, took a contrary view. It took the BSNL twin test to be applicable as a general proposition, i.e., one that admits of no variance. As discussed above, we do not think this can ever be a correct reading of BSNL.”  It is argued that BSNL (supra) itself made exceptions as to what did not constitute sale.",

The observations of the tribunal in this regard, which were commended for consideration and endorsement of this court, are as follows:  “the service that the appellant is providing to the franchisee is with a view to get the gross sales of the franchisee augmented so that it may get more royalty which means that the provision of sales under the MLA is designed in a manner to ensure continual enhancement of sales of the franchisee meaning thereby that provisions incorporated in the MLA are just for the purpose of the gross sales enhanced.

Ltd 1999 (112) STC 320, where it was held that:  “There is a distinction between transfer of right to use a trade mark and assignment of a trade mark. \"Assignment\" of trade mark is taken to be a sale or transfer of the trade mark by the owner or proprietor thereof to a third party inter vivos. By assignment, the original owner or proprietor of trade mark is divested of his right, title or interest therein. He is not so divested by transfer of right to use the same. Licence to use a trade mark is thus quite distinct and different from assignment. It is not accompanied by transfer of any right or title in the trade mark. The transfer of right to use a trade mark falls under the purview of the 1985 Act and not the assignment thereof. The manner of transfer of the right to use the goods to the transferee would depend upon the nature of the goods. For transfer of right to use a trade mark, permission in writing as required by law may be enough. In case of tangible property, handing over of the property to the transferee may be essential for the use thereof. All that will depend upon the nature of the goods. Take for instance, transfer of right to use machinery. The right to use the machinery cannot be transferred by transferor to the transferee without transfer of control over it. The case before the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v Commercial Tax Officer was a case of transfer of right to use machinery. It was in that context, the above decision came to be rendered. But the position in case of trade mark is different. For transferring the right to use the trade mark, it is not necessary to hand over the trade mark to the transferee or give control or possession of trade mark to him. It can be done merely by authorising the transferee to use the same in the manner required by the law as has been done in the present case. The right to use the trade mark can be  transferred simultaneously to any number of persons. The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v Commercial Tax Officer thus has no application to the transfer of right to use a trade mark.”",

The object of the franchise agreement between McDonald‟s and its franchisee(s) is to operate a comprehensive restaurant system (consisting of manuals, instructions etc., to run McDonald‟s‟ restaurants) at the locations specified in the agreement, albeit, without an exclusive transfer of right to use the same. Similarly, the agreements signed by the Petitioners (Sagar Ratna, Bikanerwala in whose cases the arrangement is a franchise contract) give the respective franchisees limited rights to operate services within the agreement, and are nonexclusive in nature; the franchisors remaining entitled to transfer rights to any third party to use their trade mark. In the case of GSK, the foreign, trade mark owner permitted use of the trade mark, subject to strict conditions with respect to the production and sale of the articles in question.",

                        "content": "The fundamental premise behind enlargement of the definition of the term “sale” under Article 366 (29A) of the Constitution of India is the introduction of transactions which, although, do not qualify the definition of the term “sale” but would still be deemed to be considered as “sale” under  the enlarged definition for the taxability purposes. Hence, it was submitted that deeming fiction which introduces the concept of “deemed” or “mutant” sales needs to be interpreted in a strict manner and the scope of such deeming fiction should only be to the extent of what is actually envisaged/intended by introduction of “deemed sales”. Article 366 (29A)(d) of the Constitution reads as follows:  “(29A) tax on the sale or purchase of goods includes  (a)  a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contact, of property in any goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;  (b)  a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) invoked in the execution of a works contract;  (c)  a tax on the delivery of goods on hire purchase or any system of payment by instalments;  (d)  a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;”  Thus, for a tax to be levied on the sale or purchase of goods, there has to be a transfer of the right to use the goods; what thus needs to be assessed is whether the franchise agreements give rise to such a transfer of the right to use the goods; in addition to adjudging whether the nature of the content of the franchise agreements (for instance, that which comprises the “McDonald‟s system”) is one of goods or services.36. Firstly, the franchise agreement needs to be read in its entirety to understand the intention of the contract, it would be incorrect to cull out only a section of the agreement to make it leviable to VAT. The franchise agreement  evidently intends to make a non-exclusive transfer of the composite system of services that is not limited to the trade mark, but is inclusive of a bunch of services, and hence, cannot be treated as goods and be subject to VAT. By virtue of this observation alone, the levy under the DVAT is incorrect. In Commissioner VAT, Trade and Taxes Department v. International Travel House Ltd. [2009] (25) VST 653, a Division Bench of this court held that composite contracts cannot be split up by taking from it the value of the goods for the purposes of taxing the same under DVAT Act. The relevant part of the judgement reads as follows:  “1. The conclusion, therefore, which emerges with respect to the facts of the present case on applying the ratio of the BSNL's case is that, since the contract in question is a composite contract of sale of goods and services, clearly, it is not permissible for the State Legislature by applying DVAT Act to tax composite contracts comprising of both goods and services. Not only the contracts cannot be artificially split up so as to enable the sale element to be taxed, further, the States cannot treat the contract as only a contract of sale of goods and tax the whole value of the transaction as a sale of goods. Since the parties have not intended the contract to be mutilated/severable inasmuch as no different values are specified in the subject contract towards goods value separately and the value of services separately, it is not permissible by the DVAT Act to impose sales tax on the whole transaction value because that would amount to the State to entrench upon the Union List and tax services by including the cost of such services in the value of the goods. Thus, the contract in question being a composite contract is to be treated as a contract for services and no sales tax can be imposed on the contracts in question. It has also been held by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in its judgment reported as Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. and Anr. v. State of U.P. and Ors. (2005) 2 SCC 515 that taxing entries must be  construed with clarity and precision so as to maintain exclusivity and a construction of a taxation entry which may lead to overlapping must be eschewed. Reference in that case was also made to the judgment in Kesoram Industries Ltd.'s case that in our Constitution a conflict of the taxing power of the Union and States cannot arise. Since the contract in question is taxed as services by the Central Government defining the same as services under the Finance Act, 1994, we would have to thus eschew an interpretation which will lead to overlapping in the taxation entries otherwise the same transaction will be taxed both as services as also goods. To avoid that overlapping, and more particularly in view of the legislative history behind the provision of Article 366(29A) it becomes clear that a composite contract of both services and goods should be treated as a contract of services assessable to tax under the Finance Act, 1994 as the same has been defined and included therein. Our aforesaid discussion negates therefore the two pleas of the senior counsel for the appellant on the basis of the judgments reported as State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. and Ors. (2004) 10 SCC 201 and Ralla Ram v. Province of East Punjab AIR 1949 FC 81, that the measure of taxation being the whole value of the contract cannot mean that the tax is still not a tax on goods and that subject matter of the taxation being the goods, DVAT Act can impose tax on composite contracts on the entire value of the transaction.”",

From a perusal of the facts of the cases, as well as the provisions of the franchise agreements, it can be concluded that what was intended to be transferred was not the trade mark, but an entire gamut of services, which includes, inter alia, a guide that educates the franchisees on  various aspects of business and conduct to market the business. To segregate the terms of the agreement to levy VAT on only specific aspects of it would be inexact. Moreover, the Appellant and the Petitioners are already paying service tax levied on the franchise agreements, and there can be no overlapping of taxes. The subject matters in List I and List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution are distinct and once a particular service is subject to service tax, it cannot be treated as a sale of goods and subject to VAT. Thus, the definition of “intellectual property” and levy of sales tax on transfer of right to use trade marks, patents and copyrights etc. will not apply in the case of a franchise agreement.

Section 65(47) of the Finance Act 1994 reads as follows:  “[(47) “franchise” means an agreement by which the franchisee is granted representational right to sell or manufacture goods or to provide service or undertake any process identified with franchisor, whether or not a trade mark, service mark, trade name or logo or any such symbol, as the case may be, is involved;…”  Thus, by definition, the franchise agreement grants only a representational right and not an exclusive right to sell/ manufacture goods.

In usual cases of licensing, the trade mark owner may not wish to use mark its products or services in an area or region; it instead would license the mark, to be used by the licensee‟s products, subject to limitations. The licensee has no right to initiate legal proceedings, in the event of infringement (i.e statutory right given to an owner or someone having proprietary rights over the mark, to seek injunction and damages). This is clear from Section 28 of the Trade marks Act:  (1)  Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods or service in respect of which the trade  mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by this Act.  (2)  The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under sub-section (1) shall be subject to any conditions and limitations to which the registration is subject.”  The property in the mark always vests with the owner. Furthermore, importantly the use of the mark by the licensee inures to the owner, as the latter‟s continuous use, in terms of Section 48 of the Trade marks Act, which is as follows:  (1)  Subject to the provisions of section 49, a person other than the registered proprietor of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user thereof in respect of any or all of the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.  (2)  The permitted use of trade mark shall be deemed to be used by the proprietor thereof, and shall be deemed not to be used by a person other than the proprietor, for the purpose of section 47 or for any other purpose for which such use in material under this Act or any other law.”  Therefore, when a trade vendor, distributor, establishment or anyone else permitted to sell articles or offer services the trade marks (or brand) which belongs to another, it is incorrect to state that the brand or mark, associated with the product, constitutes the sale rather than from sale of the underlying goods or services that are the subject of the trade mark (dishes in a restaurant) themselves. It would be incorrect, therefore, to conclude what is involved is not the sale of the product, but the intangible property or mark connected with the reputation of the mark, though that reputation guarantees  a high demand for the product, from which the seller benefits. Likewise, in the case of distribution, a distribution agent is under an agreement with the manufacturer to sell its good; it also possesses the right to advertise the goods and brands of the manufacturer. This implies a license of the manufacturer‟s trade mark. In such an event, the distributor need not pay for the right to use the intellectual property under which the goods are sold; he merely pays for obtaining the commercial right to sell the goods he buys from the manufacturer for enabling onward sale.",

For the period during which the transferee has such legal right, it has to be the exclusion to the transferor -this is the necessary concomitant of the plain language of the statute -viz. a \"transfer of the right to use\" and not merely a licence to use the goods;  e. Having transferred the right to use the goods during the period for which it is to be transferred, the owner cannot again transfer the same rights to others.”  It was similarly held in 20th Century Finance Corporation Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra (2000) 119 STC 182 that a right to use goods accrues only on transfer of right. The Supreme Court in this case held that the taxable event under Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution was the transfer of the right to use goods, and a distinction was set out between a transfer of a right to use goods and a mere permissive use of goods. Paragraphs 26 and 27 of the judgment read:  “26. Next question that arises for consideration is, where is the taxable event on the transfer of the right to use any goods. Article 366(29A)(d)empowers the State legislature to enact law imposing sales tax on the transfer of the right to use goods. The various sub-clauses of Clause(29A) of Article 366 permit the imposition of tax thus: Sub-clause (a)on transfer of property in goods; Sub-clause (b) on transfer of property in goods; Sub-clause (c) on delivery of goods; Sub-clause (d) on transfer of the right to use goods; Sub-clause (e) on supply of goods; and Sub clause (f) on supply of services. The words “and such transfer, delivery or supply...\" in the latter portion of Clause (29A), therefore, refer to the words transfer, delivery and supply, as applicable, used in the various sub-clauses. Thus, the transfer of goods will be a deemed sale in the cases of subclauses (a) and (b), the delivery of goods will be a deemed sale in case of Subclause (c), the supply of goods and services respectively will be deemed sales in the cases of sub-clauses (e) and (f) and the transfer of the right to use any goods will be a deemed sale in the case of Sub-clause (d). Clause (29A) cannot, in our view, be read as implying that the tax under Sub-clause (d) is to be imposed not on the transfer of the right to use goods but on the delivery of the goods for use. Nor, in our view, can a transfer of the right to use goods in Subclause (d) of Clause (29A) be equated with the third sort of bailment referred to in  \"Bailment\" by Palmer, 1979 edition, page 88. The third sort referred to there is when goods are left with the bailee to be used by him for hire, which implies the transfer of the goods to the bailee. In the case of Sub-clause (d), the goods are not required to be left with the transferee. All that is required is that there is a transfer of the right to use the goods. In our view, therefore, on a plain construction of Sub-clause (d) of Clause (29A), the taxable event is the transfer of the right to use the goods regardless of when or whether the goods are delivered for use. What is required is that the goods should be in existence so that they may be used. And further contract in respect thereof is also required to be executed. Given that, the locus of the deemed sale is the place where the right to use the goods is transferred. Where the goods are when the right to use them is transferred is of no relevance to the locus of the deemed sale. Also of no relevance to the deemed sale is where the goods are delivered for use pursuant to the transfer of the right to use them, though it may be that in the case of an oral or implied transfer of the right to use goods, it is effected by the delivery of the goods.",

                        "content": "The peculiarity of intangibles or incorporeal property, of the kind this court has to deal with, i.e. intellectual property, is that unlike real property, its boundaries are unset. These rights are only real and effective to the extent they enable the owner or transferee to “keep out” from use those who are not permitted to do so. In other words, the nature of intellectual property and the remedies provided for their enforcement, hinge upon the right to exclude others from using it. The distinctiveness of a mark, earned through dint of  continuous use and brand building, results in the trade mark which is classically known as “a badge of origin” that assures the user of the products the constancy of the quality associated with it. Only ensuring that others who do not own it are prevented from using or appropriating it ensures its enforcement. In the case of the franchise agreements involved in the present case, none of the franchisees or in the case of the trade mark licensee (or in GSK‟s petition the trade mark licensee), are empowered to safeguard violation of the mark, through enforcement mechanisms, such as filing suits for injunction or damages. This underlines that the most important attribute of ownership or transfer (even in the most evanescent sense) is absent. Furthermore, by reason of Section 48 of the Trade Marks Act, the utilization of the mark by the franchisee/licensee would accrue to the trade mark owner. Therefore, the reputation or brand building which accrues on account of increased volume of business because of the franchise/licensing arrangement, continues to be with the owner. No brand building or brand benefit accrues or arises to the franchisee/licensee.",

                        "content": "The law with regard to negative covenant in employer-employee contract is well-settled. The Supreme Court in Niranjan Shankar Golikari Vs. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd; (1967) 2 S.C.R. 378 has held that the negative covenant operative during the period of employment when the employee is bound to serve his employer exclusively is not to be regarded as restraint of trade and therefore not violative of Section 27 of the Contract Act. The Supreme Court, however, held that a restrictive covenant extending beyond the term of the contract is void and not enforceable. The relevant portion of the said judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:- “The result of the above discussion is that considerations against restrictive covenants are different in cases where the restriction is to apply during the period after the termination of the contract than those in cases where it is to operate during the period of the contract. Negative covenants operative during the period of the contract of employment when the employee is bound to serve his employer exclusively are generally not regarded as restraint of trade and therefore do not fall under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1431516/>)section 27 of the Contract Act. A negative covenant that the employee would not engage himself in a trade or business or would not get himself employed by any other master for whom he would perform similar or substantially similar duties is not therefore a restraint of trade unless the contract as aforesaid is unconscionable or excessively harsh or unreasonable or one sided as in the case of W.H. Milsted and Son Ltd., 1927 WN 233 (Supra). Both the Trial Court and the High Court have found, and in our view, rightly, that the negative covenant in the present case restricted as it is to the period of employment and to work similar or substantially similar to the one carried on by  the appellant when he was in the employ of the respondent company was reasonable and necessary for the protection of the company's interests and not such as the court would refuse to enforce. There is therefore no validity in the contention that the negative covenant contained in clause 17 amounted to a restraint of trade and was therefore against public policy.”",
