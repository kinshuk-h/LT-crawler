Bhansali who is having technical knowledge in his field of operations and business has difficulty in communicating and conversing in English and since his knowledge of English and his ability to communicate in English is very limited, he has requested his Advocate to inspect the files on his behalf and brief him on the contours of the present inquiry and investigation. In terms of Regulations 37 and 50 of the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations, 2009, requisite fee was also enclosed and a request was made to permit the petitioner's Advocate to inspect the files so that Sh.Bhansali can effectively participate in the summons issued to him.  The earlier request  to provide all the relevant materials, documents, information, etc. on the basis of which the prima facie order dated 06.11.2013 has been passed against the petitioner No.1 along with a copy of all the meetings of the Commission/orders of the Commission in the said case are also required to be furnished.

In response to the same, the Managing Director of the petitioner No.1 filed his affidavit before CCI dated 27.12.2015. Ultimately by the impugned notice dated 11.01.2016, petitioner No.1 was informed that its request for inspection of records and supply of certified copies of documents cannot be acceded to since the said information based on which prima facie order for investigation has been passed by CCI is confidential in terms of the provisions of the Competition Act read with the relevant Regulations. Thereafter, by letter dated 27.01.2016, the respondent No.3 while providing some of the documents called upon the petitioner No.1 to submit its reply by 08.02.2016 by way of an affidavit signed by the Managing Director of the petitioner No.1 company.",

Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in LPA No.733/2014, it is contended that the investigation by the Director General would amount to commencement of trial/inquiry and therefore, the parties are entitled to defend themselves and that the information available with the Director General cannot be denied to a person who is alleged to have contravened the provisions of an Act on the ground of confidentiality. The action of the respondents in denying access to the petitioner to the information/documents available with the Director General is contrary to the very scheme of the Act which contemplates that the parties  have a right to present their views before the Director General and which will be taken into consideration for submitting the report of the Director General.

(4)  A request under sub-regulation (2) shall be accompanied with a statement setting out cogent reasons for such  treatment and to the extent possible the date on which such confidential treatment shall expire.  (5)  Where such document or documents, or a part or parts thereof, form part of the party‟s written submissions, the party shall file a complete version with the words “restriction of publication claimed” in red ink on top of the first page and the word „confidential‟ clearly and legibly marked in red ink near the top on each page together with a public version, which shall not contain such document or documents or part or parts thereof.

(10)  In case the Director-General has rejected the request of the party made under sub-regulation (2), the party may approach the Commission for a decision regarding confidential treatment.  (11)  Where the Director-General or the Commission has rejected the request for confidential treatment of a document or documents or a part or parts thereof and has informed the party of its intention, such document or documents or part or parts thereof shall, subject to sub-regulation (13), not be treated as confidential.  (12)  [omitted by notification dated 31.03.2011]  (13)  The document or documents or a part or parts thereof that have been granted confidential treatment under this regulation shall be segregated from the public record and secured in a sealed envelope or any other appropriate container, bearing the title, the docket number of the proceeding, the notation “confidential record under regulation 35” and the date on which confidential treatment expires.

Though the petitioners in the present petitions have challenged the validity of certain statutory Regulations, it is apparent that their main grievance is regarding the letter dated 11.01.2016 whereby the CCI rejected the request of the petitioners for inspection of the records and supply of certified copies of the documents. A perusal of the letter dated 11.01.2016 shows that the request of the  petitioners was rejected on the ground that (i) the information sought is confidential in terms of the provisions of the Act and the Regulations made thereunder and (ii) the matter has been referred to the Director General for investigation and the same is currently pending, thus, the request may be referred to the Director General directly in terms of the provisions of CCI (General) Regulations, 2009.",

SAIL; (2010) 10 SCC 744, formation of a prima facie opinion departmentally, i.e., by the Director General appointed by the Central Government to assist CCI does not amount to an adjudicatory function but is merely of administrative nature. At that stage, it does not condemn any person and therefore, application of audi altrem partem is not called for. The relevant excerpts from CCI Vs. SAIL may be reproduced hereunder for ready reference:- \"31. xxx xxx xxx  (1) xxx xxx xxx  (2)  Neither any statutory duty is cast on the Commission to issue notice or grant hearing, nor can any party claim, as a matter of right, notice and/or hearing at the stage of formation of opinion by the Commission, in terms of Section 26(1) of the Act that a prima facie case exists for issuance of a direction to the Director General to cause an investigation to be made into the matter.  However, the Commission, being a statutory body exercising, inter alia, regulatory jurisdiction, even at that stage, in its discretion and in appropriate cases may call upon the party(s) concerned to render required assistance or produce requisite information, as per its directive. The Commission is expected to form such prima facie view without entering upon any adjudicatory or determinative process. The Commission is entitled to form its opinion  without any assistance from any quarter or even with assistance of experts or others. The Commission has the power in terms of Regulation 17(2) of the Regulations to invite not only the information provider but even “such other person” which would include all persons, even the affected parties, as it may deem necessary. In that event it shall be “preliminary conference”, for whose conduct of business the Commission is entitled to evolve its own procedure.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

These proceedings are initiated by the intimation or reference received by the Commission in any of the manners specified under Section 19 of the Act. At the very threshold, the Commission is to exercise its powers in passing the direction for investigation; or where it finds that there exists no prima facie case justifying passing of such a direction to the Director General, it can close the matter and/or pass such orders as it may deem fit and proper. In other words, the order passed by the Commission under Section 26(2) is a final order as it puts an end to the proceedings initiated upon receiving the information in one of the specified modes. This order has been specifically made appealable under Section 53-A of the Act.",

It does not effectively determine any right or obligation of the parties to the lis. Closure of the case causes determination of rights and affects a party i.e. the informant; resultantly, the said party has a right to appeal against such closure of case under Section 26(2) of the Act. On  the other hand, mere direction for investigation to one of the wings of the Commission is akin to a departmental proceeding which does not entail civil consequences for any person, particularly, in light of the strict confidentiality that is expected to be maintained by the Commission in terms of Section 57 of the Act and Regulation 35 of the Regulations.",

Section 26(1), as already noticed, requires the Commission to form an opinion whether or not there exists a prima facie case for issuance of direction to the Director General to conduct an investigation. This section does not mention about issuance of any notice to any party before or at the time of formation of an opinion by the Commission on the basis of a reference or information received  by it. Language of Sections 3(4) and 19 and for that matter, any other provision of the Act does not suggest that notice to the informant or any other person is required to be issued at this stage. In contradistinction to this, when the Commission receives the report from the Director General and if it has not already taken a decision to close the case under Section 26(2), the Commission is not only expected to forward the copy of the report, issue notice, invite objections or suggestions from the informant, the Central Government, the State Government, statutory authorities or the parties concerned, but also to provide an opportunity of hearing to the parties before arriving at any final conclusion under Sections 26(7) or 26(8) of the Act, as the case may be. This obviously means that wherever the legislature has intended that notice is to be served upon the other party, it has specifically so stated and we see no compelling reason to read into the provisions of Section 26(1) the requirement of notice, when it is conspicuous by its very absence. Once the proceedings before the Commission are completed, the parties have a right to appeal under Section 53-A(1)(a) in regard to the orders termed as appealable under that provision. Section 53-B requires that the Tribunal should give, parties to the appeal, notice and an opportunity of being heard before passing orders, as it may deem fit and proper, confirming, modifying or setting aside the direction, decision or order appealed against.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Furthermore, that non-compliance therewith, would always result in violation of fundamental requirements vitiating the entire proceedings. Different laws have provided for exclusion of principles of natural justice at different stages, particularly, at the initial stage of the proceedings and such laws have been upheld by this Court. Wherever, such exclusion is founded on larger public interest and is for compelling and valid reasons, the courts have declined to entertain such a challenge. It will always depend upon the nature of the proceedings, the grounds for invocation of such law and the requirement of compliance with the principles of natural justice in light of the above-noticed principles.  xxx  xxx xxx 83. The provisions of Section 26(1) clearly indicate exclusion of principles of natural justice, at least at the initial stages, by necessary implication. In cases where the conduct of an enterprise, association of enterprises, person or association of persons or any other legal entity, is such that it would cause serious prejudice to the public interest and also violates the provisions of the Act, the Commission will be well within its jurisdiction to pass ex parte ad interim injunction orders immediately in terms of Section 33 of the Act, while granting post-decisional hearing positively, within a very short span in terms of Regulation 31(2). This would certainly be more than adequate compliance with the principles of natural justice.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

The Commission is not expected to give notice to the parties i.e. the informant or the affected parties and hear them at length, before forming its opinion. The function is of a very preliminary nature and in fact, in common parlance, it is a departmental function. At that stage, it does not condemn any person and therefore, application of audi alteram partem is not called for. Formation of a prima facie opinion departmentally (the Director General, being appointed by the Central Government to assist the Commission, is one of the wings of the Commission itself)  does not amount to an adjudicatory function but is merely of administrative nature. At best, it can direct the investigation to be conducted and report to be submitted to the Commission itself or close the case in terms of Section 26(2) of the Act, which order itself is appealable before the Tribunal and only after this stage, there is a specific right of notice and hearing available to the aggrieved/affected party. Thus, keeping in mind the nature of the functions required to be performed by the Commission in terms of Section 26(1), we are of the considered view that the right of notice or hearing is not contemplated under the provisions of Section 26(1) of the Act.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

In the backdrop of these determinants, we may refer to the provisions of the Act. Section 26, under its different sub-sections, requires the Commission to issue various directions, take decisions and pass orders, some of which are even appealable before the Tribunal. Even if it is a direction under any of the provisions and not a decision, conclusion or order passed on merits by the Commission, it is expected that the same would be supported by some reasoning. At the stage of forming a prima facie view, as required under Section 26(1) of the Act, the Commission may not really record detailed reasons, but must express its mind in no uncertain terms that it is of the view that prima facie case exists, requiring issuance of direction for investigation to the Director General. Such view  should be recorded with reference to the information furnished to the Commission. Such opinion should be formed on the basis of the records, including the information furnished and reference made to the Commission under the various provisions of the Act, as aforereferred. However, other decisions and orders, which are not directions simpliciter and determining the rights of the parties, should be well reasoned analysing and deciding the rival contentions raised before the Commission by the parties. In other words, the Commission is expected to express prima facie view in terms of Section 26(1) of the Act, without entering into any adjudicatory or determinative process and by recording minimum reasons substantiating the formation of such opinion, while all its other orders and decisions should be well reasoned.\"",

[Vide : Natwar Singh Vs. Director of Enforcement; (2010) 13 SCC 255].

Director of Enforcement (supra):  \"26. Even in the application of the doctrine of fair play there must be real flexibility. There must also have been caused some real prejudice to the complainant; there is no such thing as a merely technical infringement of natural justice.

Every person before an authority exercising the adjudicatory powers has a right to know the evidence to be used against him. This principle is firmly established and recognised by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v. CIT [AIR 1955 SC 65 : (1955) 1 SCR 941] . However, disclosure not necessarily involves supply of the material. A person may be allowed to inspect the file and take notes. Whatever mode is used, the fundamental principle remains that nothing should be used against the person which has not been brought to his notice. If relevant material is not disclosed to a party, there is prima facie unfairness irrespective of whether the material in question arose before, during or after the hearing. The law is fairly well settled if prejudicial allegations are to be made against a person, he must be given particulars of that before hearing so that he can prepare his defence. However, there are various exceptions to this general rule where disclosure of evidential material might inflict serious harm on the person directly concerned or other persons or where disclosure would be breach of confidence or might be injurious to the public interest because it would involve the revelation of official secrets, inhibit frankness of comment and the detection of crime, might make it impossible to obtain certain clauses of essential information at all in the future (see R. v.

Imposing of penalty after the adjudication is fraught with grave and serious consequences and therefore, the requirement of providing a reasonable opportunity of being heard before imposition of any such penalty is to be met. In contradistinction, the opinion formed by the adjudicating authority whether an inquiry should be held into the allegations made in the complaint are not fraught with such grave consequences and therefore the minimum requirement of a show-cause notice and consideration of cause shown would meet the ends of justice.

It was also held that the rules are liable to be declared invalid if they are manifestly unjust or oppressive or outrageous or directed to be unauthorized and/or violative of the general principles of law of the land or so vague that it cannot be predicted with certainty as to what it prohibited or so unreasonable that they cannot be attributed to the power delegated or otherwise disclose bad faith. It was further explained by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Shree Sitaram Sugar Company Ltd. v. Union of India; (1990) 3 SCC 223 that the power delegated by statute is limited by its terms and subordinate to its objects and that the delegate must act in good faith, reasonably, intra vires the power granted, and on relevant consideration of material facts. It was also added that all the decisions of the delegate, whether characterized as legislative or administrative or quasi  judicial, must be in harmony with the constitution and other laws of the land and that they must be reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.",

In India any enquiry into the vires of delegated legislation must be confined to the grounds on which plenary legislation may be questioned, to the ground that it is contrary to the statute under which it is made, to the ground that it is contrary to other statutory provisions or that it is so arbitrary that it could not be said to be in conformity with the statute or that it offends Article 14 of the Constitution.",

Ltd. v. Notified Area Committee, Tulsipur [AIR 1980 SC 882 : (1980) 2 SCR 1111 : (1980) 2 SCC 295], Rameshchandra Kachardas Porwal v. State of Maharashtra [(1981) 2 SCC 722 : AIR 1981 SC 1127 : (1981) 2 SCR 866] and in Bates v. Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone [(1972) 1 WLR 1373 : (1972) 1 A11 ER 1019 (Ch D)]. A distinction must be made between delegation of a legislative function in the case of which the question of reasonableness cannot be enquired into and the investment by statute to exercise particular discretionary powers. In the latter case the question may be considered on all grounds on which administrative action may be questioned, such as, non-application of mind, taking irrelevant matters into consideration, failure to take relevant matters into  consideration, etc, etc. On the facts and circumstances of a case, a subordinate legislation may be struck down a arbitrary or contrary to statute if it fails to take into account very vital facts which either expressly or by necessary implication are required to be taken into consideration by the statute or, say, the Constitution. This can only be done on the ground that it does not conform to the statutory or constitutional requirements or that it offends Article 14 or Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. It cannot, no doubt, be done merely on the ground that it is not reasonable or that it has not taken into account relevant circumstances which the Court considers relevant.”",

In this regard, Mr Santhalia, the learned counsel for the Defendants submitted that the names of customers requiring data recovery services or other services relating to data are in public domain and can also be found from using search engines on the net. This contention was not countered by the learned counsel for the Plaintiff. However, he submitted that even though the names of the customers and/or persons looking for services may be available in public domain, the contact details of the concerned persons would not be easily ascertainable. Even assuming the same to be true, the Defendants cannot be restrained from approaching the customers since the identity of the customers is known.

In my view, this contention is also bereft of any merit as by expanding the width of the expression 'confidential information' to include information which is in public domain, the Plaintiff is not seeking protection of proprietary or confidential information, but is essentially seeking a restraint on trade. Plainly, if the expression of 'confidential information' is read in the manner as suggested by the Plaintiff, clause 4(b)(ii) of the Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement for the Employee would in effect work as a covenant in restraint of trade and, therefore, would be void by virtue of Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.",

In that case the issue was whether the copyright in the database -which included a client list and was admittedly  copied by the defendants -vested with the defendants as they had worked on it or whether the same belonged to the plaintiff. The court held that \"The mere fact that defendants would have done work for such clients while being associated with the plaintiff would not give them the right to reproduce the list and take it away\" and therefore, restrained the defendants from using the same. Even so, the court clarified that \"it is possible that a part of this information is retained in the memory of the defendants and if that is utilized no grievance can be made in this behalf. This would, however, be different from a copy made of the list.\". The decision in Vogueserv International Pvt. Ltd. (supra) also turned on the issue of copyright.

Exception: One who sells the goodwill of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar business, within specified local limits, so long as the buyer or any other person deriving title to the goodwill from him, carries on a like business therein, provided that such limits appear to the Court reasonable, regard being had to the nature of the business.\"  The section is general in terms, and declares all agreements in restraint void pro tanto, except in the case specified in the exception.",

After a review of all the decisions of the Supreme Court and the High Courts, including this Court, the following points become clear:  1)  Negative covenants tied up with positive covenants during the subsistence of a contact be it of employment, partnership, commerce, Page 2704 agency or the like, would not normally be regarded as being in restraint of trade, business of profession unless the same are unconscionable or wholly one-sided;  2)  Negative covenants between employer and employee contracts pertaining to the period post termination and restricting an employee's right to seek employment and/or to do business in the same field as the employer would be in restraint of trade and, therefore, a stipulation to this effect in the contract would be void. In other words, no employee can be confronted with the situation where he has to either work for the present employer or be forced to idleness;  3)  While construing a restrictive or negative covenant and for determining whether such covenant is in restraint of trade, business or profession or not, the courts take a stricter view in employer-employee contracts than in other contracts, such as partnership contracts, collaboration contracts, franchise  contracts, agency/distributorship contracts, commercial contracts. The reason being that in the latter kind of contracts, the parties are expected to have dealt with each other on more or less an equal footing, whereas in employer-employee contracts, the norm is that the employer has an advantage over the employee and it is quite often the case that employees have to sign standard form contracts or not be employed at all;  4)  The question of reasonableness as also the question of whether the restraint is partial or complete is not required to be considered at all whenever an issue arises as to whether a particular term of a contract is or is not in restraint of trade, business or profession\"",

However, the said suggestion is refuted by the petitioner on the following grounds:  i.  The Non-Compete Agreement is not in any manner linked with or reliant upon the subsistence of the Rice Supply Agreement. The obligations of respondent Nos. 2 to 4, and their affiliates, which includes respondent No.1, as under the Non Compete Agreement, remain valid and binding, irrespective and independent of the subsistence of the Rice Supply Agreement;  ii.  Clause 8.5 of the Business Transfer Agreement has no applicability in the present circumstances as the Rice Supply Agreement has been terminated prior to the expiry of the lock-in period and for substantial and sufficient cause. While the respondents have repeatedly attempted to suggest that the termination is without cause, there has been no judicial finding on this account. It is impermissible  for the respondent No.1 to unilaterally declare that the Rice Supply Agreement has been terminated without cause.  iii.  Respondent Nos.2 to 4 have been paid separate and substantial consideration under the Non-Compete Agreement, and have been duly compensated for entering into the said Agreement. Their obligation to refrain from competing with the petitioner in the domestic market is hence independent of the subsistence of the Rice Supply Agreement.",

He states that the respondents were obligated to accept all orders which are consistent with clause 4.3 and 4.4 of the RSA, subject to the availability restrictions under clause 4.5. In June-July 2015, petitioner placed orders for supply of 71,741 quintals of rice, which was duly accepted by respondents, for delivery by 30th July, 2015. However, only 47,547 quintals of required goods was delivered as of 7th August, 2015. The respondents without any valid explanation have stated in its response to the Termination notice, dated 19th September, 2015 that an unexpectedly high order was placed and the blends were changed frequently.",

In fact they have failed to make adequate alternative arrangements to fulfill orders under Clause 4.5 of the Rice Supply Agreement,  as they were required to inform the petitioner in writing, in case they are unable to meet the petitioner’s requirements and assist them in sourcing the same from an alternate source, then they are the defaulting party. The respondents did not comply with its obligation under Clause 4.5 and failed to inform the petitioner of its inability to supply as per the order placed. Therefore, the petitioner had no option, but to find an alternative supplier on its own account, which was communicated to respondents meeting held on 9th July, 2013, as the respondents have stated in its reply that inter alia, it had no capacity and was in a position to supply all of petitioner’s requirements, as a gesture the respondents assisted in making co-packer arrangements for petitioner and respondents did not consent to the appointment of an alternate supplier and KSF was therefore in breach of Clause 4.5.",

Even the petitioner extended finance to the respondents amounting to a total of Rs.333 Crores for procurements of paddy under 1st Financing Agreements dated 21st January,  2013, 2nd Financing Agreements dated 30th October, 2014. It is stated that petitioner was under no obligation to provide finance to respondents for supply of paddy. This arrangement was not contemplated in the RSA and was a subsequent arrangement between the parties. It was done solely upon respondents request and to ensure that they should not suffer.  The finance arrangements were made in the bonafide interests of the business. However, the respondents failed to adequately and timely provide the rice required by the petitioner, despite the funding provided and the same being communicated by the petitioner to them on multiple occasions. The respondent has indicated in its reply that it was mutually agreed between the parties that the respondents would invest only upto Rs.50 crores who has also stated in its reply that KSF wanted to invest in paddy procurement to make speculative gains, avail of cash discounts and take advantage of lower interest rates from its global financing arrangement. Thus, the said Rice Supply Agreement was rightly terminated under Clause 21.6 as amended pursuant to 2nd Amendment Agreement dated 30th October, 2013 which provides for an immediate termination without a cure period for breach of the financing agreements by respondents.",

In any event, the counsel on behalf of the respondents, submitted during the hearing on 11th February, 2016, while reading out clauses 18.1 and 18.2 of the RSA that the defence of termination without cause is available only if the termination is post the completion of the lock-in period.  It is submitted that it is the admitted position of the respondents that clause 8.5 of the BTA cannot be invoked as a defence in the present case, inasmuch as the termination is within the lock-in period of 5 years.

He states that the respondents are not in a position to export the entire lot of rice which are processed by them. The respondents have hundreds of employees and it is a running factory/company. The export market is dull, how they would be able to dispose of their stock of rice if the petitioner suo-moto choose not to receive the supply of rice. The conduct of the petitioner is highly unreasonable. The respondents have already suffered a huge loss in their business. Even if the grievance of the petitioner is assumed to be genuine, but at the same time, it is also a matter of fact that the petitioner has put the respondents into such a position where the respondents cannot shut their company and remove their employees. It is not correct that the respondents are not in a position to meet the demand of the petitioner. The respondents are ready to supply sixty thousand metric ton rice to the  petitioner. Still if there is more requirement by the petitioner, his client may procure the remaining demand of rice from other traders. However, there is no valid justification on the part of the petitioner to enter into agreements to supply the rice to other five traders. The said act of the petitioner is contrary to the terms of the Rice Supply Agreement. He submits that the entire dispute in hand with regard to Rice Supply Agreement is triggered because of trouble created by the petitioner itself who have without any cause terminated the rice agreement. Otherwise his clients are still ready to resolve the petty dispute. He states that if the petitioner is ready to receive the rice from the respondents as per the offer given by him, the dispute can be resolved and under these circumstances, his clients would abide by all other terms by not selling the rice in the domestic market and not to use the mark Kohinoor in any manner.",

Mr.Sethi, learned Senior counsel submitted that since the petitioner had first breached the Clauses 4.1 and 5.1, therefore the respondents had no option but to sell the rice which was to be received by the petitioner. As they have refused to purchase the same, the respondents, who have huge liabilities, have to dispose of the stocks in the market.",

There is no third choice, as a sort of via media, to affirm the contract and yet to be absolved from tendering further performance unless and until A gives reasonable notice that he is once again able and willing to perform.

Even if the termination of the agreement was found to be illegal and unlawful, in case of terminable contract, the only relief which could have been granted is damages/compensation for the period of notice as provided in the contract. The terms of contract, under these circumstances, as per the respondents in their defence, which are relied upon, cannot be enforceable under Section 14(1)(a) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Besides the above, no injunction can be granted in view of Section 41(e) of the said Act as the contract between the parties is determinable and already terminated. Whether such termination is valid or not has to be gone into and decided only in the arbitral proceedings. The question as to whether the contract is specifically determinable and consequently, the same cannot be specifically enforced, is a question that would arise for consideration before the arbitral tribunal. Then at this stage, it is not proper to decide the said issue  as the termination of the contract against the respondents cannot be revived.

The main issue which arises for consideration is whether the respondents are guilty of breach of contract and if so, in the facts and circumstances of this case should the respondents be restrained by a court injunction or order of interim relief from carrying on their further arrangement with the ITC? Before deciding this issue, two questions which require urgent reply are: (1) Can the respondents be compelled to take the services from the petitioners particularly when they have lost faith, confidence and trust in each other? (2) The other question which also needs to be answered is can the petitioners be adequately compensated in terms of money when it is ultimately proved that the respondents are guilty of breach of contract?",

The passing off is an action in deceit where there are three ingredients which are required to be satisfied in order to make out the case of the tort of passing off which are goodwill, misrepresentation in the course of the trade and resultant damage occurred to the plaintiff. In order to determine whether the plaintiff has established the ingredients for successfully bringing an action for passing off it will be appropriate to advert to the broad principles of the law of passing off. In 'Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names'-pages 42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated here as under:  \"The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general proposition -no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number.  a)  Firstly, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying 'get-up' (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services.  b)  Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to  belief that the goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.  c)  Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quick time action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or service is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff...\"",

A line must be drawn somewhere between honest and dishonest trading fair and unfair competition. One cannot do business of the plaintiff’s expensive labour and effort. One cannot deliberately reap and cannot be allowed to filch a rival trades. Passing off is thus a redemp for injury to goodwill.”",

Prahlad Singh, AIR 1993 SC 276. The relevant portion of the observations of the Supreme Court in the said case states as under:- “…..It is settled law that the grant of injunction is a discretionary relief.  The exercise thereof is subject to the Court satisfying that;  (1)  There is a serious disputed question to be tried in the suit and that an act, on the facts before the court, there is probability of his being entitled to the relief asked for by the plaintiff/defendant.  (2)  The court’s interference is necessary to protect the party from the species of injury. In other words, irreparable injury or damage would ensue before the legal right would be established at trial; and  (3)  The comparative hardship or mischief or inconvenience which is likely to occur from withholding the injunction will be greater than that would be likely to arise from granting it.”  The Supreme Court further held:  “……Prima facie case is not to be confused with prima facie title which has to be established, on evidence at the trial. Only prima facie case is a substantial question raised, bona fide, which needs investigation and a decision on merits. Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction. The court further has to satisfy that non-interference by the court would result in ‘irreparable injury’ to the party seeking relief and that there is no other remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction and he needs protection from the consequence of apprehended injury or dispossession of apprehended injury or  dispossession.  Irreparable injury, however, does not mean that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the injury, but means only that the injury must be a material one, namely on that cannot be adequately compensated by way of damages. The third condition also is that ‘the balance of convenience’ must be in favour of granting injunction. The court while granting or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if the injunction is refused and compare it with that it is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is granted. If on weighing competing possibility or probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the court considers that pending the suit, the subject matter should be maintained in status quo, an injunction would be issued. Thus the court has to exercise its sound judicial discretion in granting or refusing the relief of ad interim injunction pending the suit.”  In M/s. Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Others v. Coca Cola Company and Others, AIR 1995 SC 2372, it was observed as under:- “46. ……The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such protection has, however, to be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the 'balance of convenience' lies......”",

(e)  The details of advertisements figures approximately Rs.1,88,68,161/-on account of advertising and business promotion under the said mark in various newspapers, journals as well as in  other media agencies from the year 2003-2004 to 2014-2015 by the plaintiff company have been mentioned in para 16 of the plaint.  f)  The plaintiff-Company has also won national and international acclaim in the form of prestigious awards and distinctions. Some of such awards are:  (i)  World class quality control company namely, ACSR International Inc., Ann Arbor Michigan, USA, visited plaintiff company and awarded it the prestigious 150 ISO 14001 certificate. ISO 14001 certificates provide an assurance that the unit is committed to achieving continuous improvement through environmental management systems.  (ii)  Indira Gandhi Priyadarshini Awards for the best chain of eco-friendly health clubs in India.  (g)  It is claimed that as a result of the goodwill and reputation the plaintiff, as on date, has entered into nine Franchise Agreements (in addition to its own fitness centres) with various interested parties throughout the country. The unisex salon services, as provided by the plaintiff, through its franchises, inter alia, offers luxury grooming services to its customers, which are tailor made suit different skin types and designed for relaxation and beautification. Services are also tailor made to suit the needs and requirements of male customers. Further, grooming services are also provided to all the customers.  (h)  The USP of the salon services being provided by plaintiff and its franchises is that all the salons currently operating under the trade  mark/trade name OZONE are governed by the Ozone Unisex Salon Operations Manual, which forms an important part of the Franchise Agreements that the plaintiff enters into with all prospective franchisees. The Operations Manual, encapsulates in detail, inter alia, the following policies and procedures which are mandatorily required to be followed by all its franchisees are as under:  a)  The training program for all its employees;  b)  Working guidelines for stylists;  c)  The Ozone Unisex Salon Designing Standards: This particular segment in the Operations Manual lays down elaborate guidelines in relation to tile selection, the salon design, wall panelling, work stations etc. to be present in the salon. This ensures that uniformity is maintained across all Ozone salons throughout the country;  d)  Clients policy, with specific emphasis on how to take special care of first-time clients;  e)  Guidelines in relation to consultation with clients, dealing with and addressing client's problem etc.;  f)  The pricing policy along with refunds and credits;  g)  Client retention policy; and  h)  Management policies and other day-to-day policies for conducting business.  (i)  It is claimed by the plaintiff that the aforementioned Operations Manual forms an integral part of all Franchise Agreements and forms part of the plaintiff's confidential proprietary information/trade secrets. It is of utmost importance that all prospective franchisees adhere to  the conditions/guidelines stipulated in the Operations Manual, as the same not only ensures uniformity and consistency across all the franchisees of the plaintiff, but such arrangement/layout/colour scheme of the salons operating under the brand OZONE, forms part of the valuable intellectual property of the plaintiff.  (j)  The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark OZONE in various classes, the details of which are as under:  (k)  In or around September 2012, defendants No.1 and 2 approached the plaintiff and expressed their interest in the said plaintiff’s Franchise Model of business. After detailed negotiations and based upon the representations and assurances made by defendants No.1 and 2, the plaintiff agreed to grant to the said  defendants a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable franchise to establish, run and operate a gymnasium and a spa under the brand name 'Ozone Fitness n Spa', from the premises viz. 23, NWA, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi ('Franchisee Premises'). Accordingly, a Franchise Agreement dated 5th November, 2012 was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants No.1 and 2 for a term of 12 years. (hereinafter the defendant Nos.1 and 2 shall be referred as defendants who are parties to the agreements).  (l)  Subsequent to entering into the Franchise Agreement, an Agreement dated 1st April, 2013 was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants No.1 and 2, which merely set out certain additional liabilities on both the parties concerned. Thereafter, a Supplementary Agreement dated 29th March, 2014 was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants No.1 and 2 wherein it was inter alia agreed that a fixed Franchise fees of INR 2,10,000/-per month + Service and other taxes (as applicable) would be paid to the plaintiff by defendants No.1 and 2. Both the aforesaid agreements form part and parcel of the Franchise Agreement and the Franchise Agreement, as amended by the subsequent agreement and the supplementary agreement, which is valid and subsisting as on date, continue to govern the rights and liabilities of the parties herein.  (m)  It is claimed that the Franchise Agreement continues to be valid and subsisting as on date, and defendants No.1 and 2 are operating a gymnasium, spa and a unisex salon under the brand Ozone Fitness n Spa from the Franchise Premises.  (n)  In the last week of May, 2015, the plaintiff gained knowledge of the fact that the defendants were promoting the Hairmasters Salon (defendant No.3) on the plaintiff’s official Facebook page. Immediately, the plaintiff investigated further into the matter and was shocked to find out that the defendants have incorporated defendant No.4-Company on 12th May, 2015. On further investigation, the plaintiff learned of, inter alia, the following illegal activities of the defendants:- a)  Defendants No.1 and 2 in brazen and blatant violation of the Franchise Agreement, which is valid and subsisting as on date, utilized the plaintiff’s know-how, expertise etc. and set up a competing business in the same neighbourhood. In fact, a glimpse of defendant No.3 salon makes it amply evident that the expertise, know-how etc. as provided by the plaintiff has been utilized in toto inasmuch as identical set up specifications, standards, arrangements, methods etc. have been employed in defendant No.3 salon.  (o)  Defendant No.1, M/s. Pure Fitness is a proprietary concern of defendant No.2, as per the information available with the plaintiff. He entered into a Franchisee Agreement with the plaintiff on behalf of defendant No.1. Defendant No.3, Hair Masters Luxury Salon, is a unisex salon, which has been opened collusively by the defendants in the same neighbourhood as Ozone Fitness n Spa, Punjabi Bagh, in blatant and brazen violation of the Franchise Agreement and during the term of the Franchise Agreement. Defendant No.4, Hair Masters Salon Private Limited is a company incorporated on 12th May, 2015,  in which defendant No.2 is one of the Directors. It is stated that defendant No.1 and defendant No.4 Companies have the same address, and thus, it is alleged that there is collusion amongst the defendants.  (p)  It is also alleged that the entire look and feel, layout, choice of colour combination etc. of defendant No.3 salon has been directly lifted from the plaintiff’s Operations Manual, which admittedly is the confidential proprietary information of the plaintiff, and which acts are blatant breach of such confidentiality.  It is alleged that defendants No.1 and 2 set up a competing business in the same neighbourhood, during the subsistence of the Franchise Agreement and they are actively promoting defendant No.3 salon through Ozone Fitness n Spa. On the official Facebook page of the Ozone Fitness n Spa (https://www.facebook.com/ danish.batra.7) which is maintained by defendants No.1 and 2, defendant No.2 is advertising defendant No.3 salon.  (q)  The allegation of the plaintiff is that the defendant No.3 salon is being advertised by defendants No.1 and 2 as the customers of the Ozone Fitness n Spa are being diverted to defendant No.3 salon premises, which is in the same neighbourhood as Ozone Fitness n Spa. Defendant No.2 is also involved in actively poaching the well-trained staff employed in Ozone Fitness n Spa's premises to work in defendant No.3's salon premises, as on 14th May, 2015 the Manager of Ozone Fitness n Spa had resigned and had commenced work in defendant No.3 salon. The staff employed in Ozone Fitness n Spa is being made to wear defendant No.3's salon uniform.  The defendant No.4 Company is even proposing to enter into franchisee agreements and is keen on expanding the Hair Masters Salon across the length and breadth of the country. The same is evident from the defendants' website viz. http://hairmasters.co.in/. Even on the Facebook page of Ozone Fitness n Spa, the defendants are openly advertising the launch of a second franchise under the brand Hairmasters in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi on their website.  (r)  It is submitted that such acts of the defendants would cause grave and irreparable injury to the plaintiff and it would also tarnish the goodwill, reputation, industry which has been acquired from the plaintiff. All of this is being done during the subsistence of a valid Franchise Agreement inter se the parties herein, and by utilizing the confidential proprietary information/trade secrets passed on by the plaintiff in pursuance to the Franchise Agreement.  (s)  The conduct of the defendants is malafide, illegal, dishonest, unethical and unlawful and is solely motivated to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff’s OZONE brand. The defendants are developing their brand Hairmasters/Hair Masters by catapulting themselves off the well-established goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff under the OZONE brand equity. The conduct of the defendants thus constitutes:  a)  Breach of Contract;  b)  Breach of Confidentiality/trade secrets;  c)  Infringement of trademarks, get-up, layout, arrangement, trade dress of Ozone Fitness Centre, Salon and Spa;  d)  Dilution and acts of unfair competition.  (t)  It is stated that the defendants are bound by the terms and conditions as stipulated in the Franchise Agreement, which is valid and subsisting as on date. It is submitted that the Franchise Agreement, as entered between the parties, is a valid and legal contract and has been entered into by both parties consensually. During the term of the Franchise Agreement and three years thereafter, the defendants are prohibited contractually from engaging in any competing business. The said term forms a material term of the contract. Therefore, by setting up a competing business, during the subsistence of the Franchise Agreement, the defendants have committed material breach of the terms of the Franchise Agreement.  Thus, they are guilty of breach of contract.  It is submitted that it was the obligation of the plaintiff to provide to defendants No.1 and 2 the requisite know-how, including but not limited to the Operations Manual, training of staff, details of products and services to be provided, details of vendors etc. who provide such products etc., in relation to setting up of the Franchise and also in continuance of such franchise successfully.  (u)  The defendants are attempting to mislead the general public into thinking that there exits an association between their salon and that of the plaintiff where none exists. The defendants are attempting to ride piggy back on the hard earned and well-established goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff, and are attempting to use the same as a stepping stone in order to launch their own brand, i.e. Hairmasters/Hair Masters.  Therefore, it is stated that all the aforesaid acts of the defendants would establish that they are attempting to associate their brand with that of the plaintiff. The acts of the defendants are causing irreparable harm and injury to the plaintiff, as the acts are diluting the said plaintiff’s brand. By adopting identical colour schemes, arrangement etc. the defendants have diluted the brand of the plaintiff.  (v)  The acts of the defendants also amount to unfair competition inasmuch as while defendant No.3 salon has been opened by utilizing the know-how, confidential proprietary information/trade secrets provided by the plaintiff, the defendants are promoting defendant No.3 salon through Ozone Fitness n Spa. Some of such instances are reiterated herein under:  •  Promotion of defendant No.3 Salon on the Notice Board/Bulletin Board of Ozone Fitness n Spa;  •  Promotion of defendant No.3 Salon on the official Facebook page of Ozone Fitness n Spa;  •  Actively poaching the well-trained employees of Ozone Fitness n Spa.  •  Encouraging the staff at Ozone Fitness n Spa to wear the uniforms of defendant No.3 salon; and  •  Blatantly diverting the clients who visit Ozone Fitness n Spa to defendant No.3 salon, since both the salons are in the same neighbourhood.  It is, therefore, submitted that all the aforesaid acts by the defendants apart from causing breach of confidentiality and contracts  also tantamount to unfair competition and the defendants cannot be allowed to ride on the goodwill and reputation earned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has put in enormous amount of hard work and has made huge investments and expenditure just to make its name a household name and a well-known mark/brand and the defendants cannot be allowed to capitalize from the same.  (x)  It is averred in the plaint that the defendant No.3, Hair Masters Luxury Salon is a unisex salon which has been opened collusively by the defendants in the same neighbourhood in a blatant and brazen violation of the Franchise Agreement and during the term of the Franchise Agreement. Defendant No.4, Hair Masters Salon Private Limited, is a company incorporated on 12th May, 2015, in which defendant No.2 is one of the Directors. The defendant No.1 and defendant No.4 Companies have the same address and thus, the collusion amongst the defendants is quite apparent.  It is alleged that not only have the defendants brazenly violated the terms of the Franchisee Agreement and have committed breach of terms of confidentiality/trade secrets but they also have violated the trademark rights which vest in the plaintiff in its brand viz. OZONE, inasmuch as defendants No.1 and 2 are openly and blatantly advertising and promoting their brand Hairmasters/Hair Masters, not only in the premises of Ozone Fitness n Spa but also online, through the official webpage of the Ozone Fitness & Spa on Facebook. It is submitted that the defendants have also caused the diversion of the customers of the plaintiff who visited their health clubs for salon purposes/ for using salon services by inducing them to  go for the salon services under the mark HAIR MASTER by visiting the premises located adjacent to the health club which is to the detriment of the saloon business of the plaintiff under the mark OZONE running through the defendants and thereby defendants are competing unfairly with that of the plaintiff.",

                        "content": "Mr.Dushyant Dave, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the defendants has made his submissions on behalf of defendants. His submissions are outlined as under:- I.  His first submission is that the ex parte ad-interim injunction order dated 24th June, 2015 has been passed on account of misrepresentation made by the plaintiff who has not come before the Court with clean hands. Further, the plaintiff has concealed the material facts from this Court which led to the passing of ex parte order dated 24th June, 2015 on an erroneous presumption and, therefore, the same is liable to be vacated.  II.  The second submission of Mr. Dave is that all the three agreements between the parties i.e. Franchise Agreement dated 5th November, 2012, Management Agreement dated 1st April, 2013 and Supplementary Agreement dated 29th March, 2014 are to be read together and clauses mentioned therein to be interpreted strictly. No different interpretation can be possible as per law, even inference of any kind cannot be drawn which may be contrary to the clauses. His submission is that perusal of said agreements would show that the main Franchise Agreement relates to the licence/ permission to the defendants to use the services of Fitness Centre and Spa only and  not Saloon business. The services of Salon have been explicitly excluded. The Agreement provides that the Franchisor (plaintiff) and the Franchisee (defendants No.1 and 2) would enter into a separate agreement for Salon if the Franchisee opts to do so.  In support of his submissions, Mr.Dave has referred clause 1.7 of the Agreement dated 5th November, 2012 as well as Annexure A to the agreement.  III.  By referring the abovementioned clause and Annexure, it is submitted by the learned Senior counsel that the Franchise Agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants was only with respect to the setting up of a Fitness centre and a Spa. The defendants set up a Fitness Centre and a Spa as per the Franchise Agreement and have been complying with all the terms of the Franchise Agreement and its Supplementary Agreements in its operations. The plaintiff has not produced any document to show about any breach of the terms of the agreements in the running of the Fitness centre and Spa, which was the subject matter of the Agreements. It is argued that in fact, the plaintiff has misled the Court by pleading that the Agreement was for the service of Salon also at the time of obtaining the injunction order. In clause 8.25, the word ‘Salon’ has come due to oversight. There was never the intention of the parties and the same was not the subject matter of the said Franchise Agreement. In order to create a camouflage of a cause of action in its favour, the plaintiff has misused the process of the Court. In fact, it was within the knowledge of the plaintiff that service of  Salon was not permitted under the Franchise Agreement. Thus, the plaintiff is guilty of playing a fraud upon the Court.  It is stated that even the Local Commissioner noted in the commission carried out on 29th June, 2014 under the orders of this Court that there is no salon running in the name of \"Ozone Fitness Centre n Spa\". The Fitness Centre and Spa is being run from the First, Second and third Floors and the Basement which is used as a godown and not a Salon as it had been falsely claimed by the plaintiff. The question of restraining the defendants from running a salon under different name at different place does not arise. Such use is completely outside the purview of the contractual relations between the plaintiff and the defendants.  IV. The third submission of Mr. Dave is that as the defendants only entered into the Franchise Agreement for the service of Fitness centre and Spa, thus, they were given the Operations Manual for Fitness Centre and Spa only. They do not have access to the Operations Manual/Trade Secrets for Salon. The plaintiff has wrongly claimed that his Operations Manual has been used by the defendants for the know-how in setting up the salon \"Hair Masters.\" The Operations Manual filed by the plaintiff is only of Salon and the same has never been given to the defendants, except the Operations Manual for Fitness Centre and Spa. The order of the Court at the time of granting ex-parte injunction to the effect, that the defendants have used the proprietary information as per the manual of the plaintiff, is thus based on a false averment made in the plaint and injunction application and incorrect information given to the Court.  V. Mr. Dave’s fourth submission is that the Salon Hair Masters is the result of much hard work and immense investment on the part of defendant No.2 who is a young man trying to set up his own bonafide business separately. It is the source of income of the defendant No.2's family other than the Ozone Fitness Centre. If the interim order about the Salon would continue, the defendant No.2 would suffer irreparable loss and injury as he has various prior commitments by his regular clients in the salon for which he is not in a position to honour if the salon is not reopened.  The plaintiff has wrongly mentioned in various paras of the plaint that the services of unisex salon is mentioned in the Franchise Agreement particularly in para 5 of that plaint wherein it is mentioned that franchisee as per Franchise Agreement were assigned by the plaintiff in setting up the ozone fitness and spa which comprises of a fitness centre, spa and a unisex salon. The said averment in the plaint is contrary to clause 1.7 of the Franchise Agreement and Annexure A which is part of agreement. As the false and incorrect statement has been made in the plaint and injunction application, the entire plaint is misconceived and the same is liable to be rejected.  Mr.Dave has referred the decision of the Supreme Court in support of his submission which was reported as S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath, (1994) 1 SCC 1. Relevant paras 5 and 6 reads as under:- “5. The High Court, in our view, fell into patent error. The short question before the High Court was whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by playing fraud on the  court. The High Court, however, went haywire and made observations which are wholly perverse. We do not agree with the High Court that “there is no legal duty cast upon the plaintiff to come to court with a true case and prove it by true evidence”. The principle of “finality of litigation” cannot be pressed to the extent of such an absurdity that it becomes an engine of fraud in the hands of dishonest litigants. The courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties. One who comes to the court, must come with clean hands.

Property-grabbers, tax-evaders, bank-loan-dodgers and other unscrupulous persons from all walks of life find the court-process a convenient lever to retain the illegal gains indefinitely.

A fraud is an act of deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain by another's loss. It is a cheating intended to get an advantage. Jagannath was working as a clerk with Chunilal Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition, executed the registered release deed (Ex. B-15) in favour of Chunilal Sowcar regarding the property in dispute. He knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal amount to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on the ground that he had purchased the property on his own behalf and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. Non-production and even non-mentioning of the release deed at the trial is tantamount to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree with the observations of the High Court that the appellants-defendants could have easily produced the  certified registered copy of Ex. B-15 and non-suited the plaintiff. A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all the documents executed by him which are relevant to the litigation. If he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite party.”",

The relevant clauses on topic-wise of the Agreement referred by him are as under:- (a)  Rights of Plaintiff under the Franchise Agreement Clauses B, 1.9, 1.13, 1.16 & Annexure B of the Agreement:  (b)  Trade & Intellectual Property: 14.6, 14.7. 14.11.  (c)  Confidentially & Trade Secrets: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4  (d)  Initial obligations of the plaintiff under the Franchise Agreement: Clauses 6.2, 6.4, 6.5  (e)  Continuing obligations of the plaintiff under the Franchise Agreement: Clauses 7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7  (f)  Obligations of the defendants: 8.6, 8.7, 8.11, 8.13  (g)  Negative Covenants: 5.2, 5.3, 15.5, 17  Dr.Singhvi has also referred clause 3 of the Franchise Agreement wherein the term is 12 years. He submits that as such, the same is legally binding and subsisting inter se the parties.  (ii)  It is stated by him that subsequent to entering into the aforesaid Franchise Agreement, the parties herein entered into a Management Agreement dated 1st April, 2013. The said Management Agreement formed part of the Franchise Agreement and there was clear understanding between the parties that the Franchise Agreement would remain in force along with the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement was entered into between the plaintiff and defendants No.1 and 2, wherein, as per Clause 4 of the said Agreement, it was mutually agreed between the parties that as and when the total business turnover exceeds INR 3 Crores (inclusive of all applicable taxes), defendants No.1 and 2 would be liable to pay an additional amount of 8% of the total business turnover. As the defendants as per Annexure-A opted for service of salon, with the consent of parties, Clause 2 was included. The said clause of the Management Agreement defined “Total Business Turnover” as:  “...........",

(iii)  It is submitted by Dr.Singhvi that defendants No.1 and 2 were permitted by the plaintiff to the defendants’ service of salon in addition to fitness and spa services, under the mark/brand/name Ozone from the Punjabi Bagh premises. As opted by the defendants, they had been operating a salon under the brand/name/mark Ozone from November 2013 to March 2015, in addition to the fitness Centre and spa from the franchised premises.  (iv)  Post commencing of Ozone salon by defendants No.1 and 2 from the franchisee premises, a Supplementary Agreement dated 29th March, 2014 was entered into between the parties. It was mutually agreed that the Franchise Agreement dated 5th November, 2012 would continue to remain in operation, except as amended by the Management Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement. In the Supplementary Agreement, it was mutually agreed inter alia between the parties that the Franchise Fee, henceforth, for the operation of Ozone fitness centre, spa and salon, from the Punjabi Bagh premises by defendants No.1 and 2, would be a fixed amount of INR 2,10,000/-(plus service tax and other taxes as applicable) per month, which is admittedly being paid by the said defendants till date to the plaintiff. It is argued by Dr. Singhvi that the main purpose of the supplementary agreement was to change the payment terms. The defendants by that time had already commenced the Fitness ‘n’ Spa  as also service of Salon which they continue to run even after the supplementary agreement for more than one year.  (v)  Dr.Singhvi has referred the reports of two Local Commissioners appointed by this Court as well as the documents filed along with the plaint and submits that on running of Ozone salon by defendants No.1 and 2 from the franchised premises from November, 2013, the intention and conduct of the defendants can be gathered without any dispute from the admission of the defendants themselves in their rejoinder to the review application at paragraphs, the report along with the annexures of Mr.Harsit Khurana, Local Commissioner appointed by this Court at para 9, page 5, and Annexure F; copies of invoices wherein the said defendants have paid to the plaintiff Franchise Fee for salon, in terms of the Franchise Agreement; and correspondence exchanged inter se the parties in relation to the day-to-day running of the Ozone salon by the defendants.  (vi)  Dr. Singhvi in order to show the malafide conduct of the defendants about the contradictory statement has referred the defendants initially filed application under Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC (which was read as under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC) making a statement to the following effect:  “............",

Thus, they were given the operations manual for Fitness Centre and Spa. The answering defendant state and submit that they do not have access to the Operations Manual/Trade Secrets for salon and have never desired so either.  .........”  He submits that in the reply, the plaintiff pointed out the above documents to convincingly establish that the defendants were making a false statement. In the rejoinder, the defendants admitted that he had run the salon services. The relevant portion is extracted herein below:  “5. ......The defendants had opened an Ozone Salon in December 2013 and talks with respect to the modalities and entering into a contract were on. In the meantime, as an ad hoc agreement, the answering defendants did pay to the plaintiff Royalty for Ozone salon for 3 months. However, when the parties were entering into the Franchise Agreement for salon, the terms and conditions thereof were not agreeable to the defendants. Thus, the deal never materialized, and in pursuance thereof the answering defendants shut down Ozone Salon in December 2014.”  It is stated that in view of the above, the defendants are making misleading and false statements. Dr. Singhvi has referred para 25 of the decision of Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. Coca Cola Company and Ors., AIR 1995 SC 2372, (at page 2389) wherein it was held that a person who seeks vacation under Order 39 Rule 4  CPC has to come with clean hands, otherwise he is not entitled to any relief.  vii)  It is also argued by Dr. Singhvi that having entered into a Franchise Agreement (read with the Management Agreement and the Supplementary Agreement), defendants No.1 and 2 are bound by the terms of the said Agreements, especially the non-compete clauses, and as such are committing breach of the said agreements. The defendants have opened up a salon under the mark HAIRMASTERS in order to compete with the business of the plaintiff in the same neighbourhood where the franchise business was being carried out by the defendants. It is stated by Dr. Singhvi that the competing business has been set up by defendants No.1 and 2, by utilizing and/or misappropriating the confidential information, including even not limited to the Operations Manual which was shared with the said defendants but the similar kind of modus operandi used by them in order to earn easy profits on the goodwill of the plaintiff.

Franchise Agreement, management agreement and supplementary agreement to contend that there exists breach or no breach of the terms of the agreement as Salon service does or does not fall within the ambit of the agreements entered between the parties. Therefore, it is necessary to first consider the relevant terms of the agreements that are reproduced and discussed below which would throw some light on the intention of the parties at the time of the entering of the agreements. The said terms are :  I.  Firstly there was a franchise agreement dated 5th November 2012 entered between the plaintiff and defendants. The relevant terms of the said agreement are discussed below:  a)  The recital A of the franchise agreement states that the plaintiff/ franchisor is engaged in the business of creating, marketing and selling facilities of fitness clubs, spa and hair care salons in India. The services offered by the franchisor are related to the category of fitness and wellness business which include the services describe in Annexure A.  b)  The recital B of the agreement reads that the Franchisor is the absolute owner of the intellectual property as described in Annexure-B of Ozone brand, mark and logo and operate the Business in accordance with a fully owned distinctive system, plan, utilizing and comprising certain proprietary marks, confidential information, standards, specifications, techniques, identifying schemes and materials, insignia, arrangement method and standard operational procedures  and the Franchisor has expended substantial time, effort and money in the development and implementation of the same.  c)  The recital G of the agreement reads that the franchisor on being satisfied with the financial capabilities of the franchisee is willing to grant the franchise the franchisee to establish, run and operate the fitness center services as given in Annexure A by utilizing the intellectual property and therefore both the parties have discussed and agreed to the basic terms subject to the conditions set out below.  II.  Thereafter, the Franchise Agreement provides for definitions and interpretation clause which provides certain definitions and the relevant ones are reproduced herein below:  a)  “Agreement” has been defined as the meaning stated in the recitals and includes the schedules, exhibits and other addenda thereto.  b)  “Franchise Business” has been defined as the franchised business of the fitness club and spa as per Annexure A to be run and operated by the Franchisee in accordance with the system and standards under the proprietary marks of the franchisor……  III.  After the definition clause, the clause 2 provides for the grant of the rights wherein clause 2.1 reads as under:  “2.1 Upon the representations of the Franchisee that it has the requisite experience, knowledge, qualification, skill and financial capability to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, the Franchisor hereby grants to the Franchisee  and the Franchisee hereby accepts the non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-assignable franchise to establish, run and operate the Franchised Business in the Territory as per the Systems and Standards and under the Intellectual Property of the Franchisor, during the terms of this Agreement. Franchisee’s rights under the Agreement are limited as provided under the Agreement and the Franchisee does not have the right to sub-franchise or sub-license the rights granted under this Agreement to any third person.”",

                        "content": "From the reading of the recitals of the agreement, definition clauses reproduced herein above and also the clause relating to grant of the licence/franchise as per clause 2.1 under the Franchise Agreement collectively, the following position emerges uptil the said reading of the clauses :  i.  Though the business activities of the franchisor/ plaintiff has been described in recital A as covering the business of the fitness club, spa and hair salons, the relevant places of the agreement uses the term “fitness club and spa” in connection with the franchised business as well as at the places of the grant.  ii.  The use of the term “hair salons” in recital A atleast makes both the parties including the franchisee aware of the scope of the business activities of the franchisor which includes the business of the hair salons. Although, it is altogether different matter whether the said business of salon is actually covered within the ambit of the franchised business under the agreement or not.  iii.  The definition of the agreement makes it apparent that the agreement means recitals and includes schedules and exhibits. Thus, the schedules and exhibits shall be considered as the part of the agreement as the recitals and other clauses. The relevance of the same shall be discussed later on under this head.  iv.  The definition of the franchised business again makes it clear that the same means the franchised business of fitness club and spa as per Annexure A to be run and operated by the franchisee. The said definition though uses the terms fitness club and spa in unambiguous terms also connects the franchised business with that of Annexure A to the agreement. Thus, Annexure A to the agreement has some relevance to define the scope and limits of the franchised business and this much is clear from the reading of the definition of the franchised business. (This aspect is not undisputed as both the parties place reliance upon Annexure A to the agreement. The defendant placed heavy reliance on Annexure A to contend that the business of the salon was expressly excluded from the scope of the agreement)  v.  Likewise, the clause 2.1 provides for the grant of the rights, which reads that the franchisor has granted the franchisee the non exclusive, non transferable, non assignable franchise to establish, run and operate the franchised  business in the territory. In the said clause, the term used in connection with the grant is “franchised business” which can be connected with the definition clause of the agreement to state the said grant relates to the franchised business of the fitness club and spa as per Annexure A as defined under the definition clause.",

                        "content": "From the combined reading of clauses 5.2, 5.3, clause 17 relating to non competition clause and Annexure A which can be said to be another set of the clauses contained in the Franchise Agreement, the following position emerges:  a)  Firstly that all these clauses 5.2, clause 17 provides for the negative covenants and state that the franchisee shall not operate, run or conduct or offer any services or carry on or  engage in or have any interest in franchised business as Schedule A. These two clauses while providing prohibitory nature of the acts clearly connects the franchised business with that of Annexure A or Schedule A of the agreement. Therefore, there are clauses under the agreement wherein expression “franchised business” is either used as solely without reference to Annexure A like clause 2.1 relating to grant and other places under the agreement. As against the same, there are clauses like 5.2, clause 17 which immediately connects the acts and businesses defined under Annexure A/Schedule A under the agreement as the acts which the franchisee is prevented to do under the agreement or any similar competing business. Thus, the annexure A/Schedule A has an inextricable nexus with that of the clauses contained in the agreement and thus cannot be totally severed from the agreement in order to give full effect to the clauses contained in the agreement.  b)  The reading of the Annexure A/schedule A to the agreement which is considered to be part of the agreement as per the definition of the agreement, it becomes clear that the Annexure A provides the extended definition of the expression Franchised business. This can be seen while comparing the definition of franchised business as provided under the definition clause which describes franchised business as “means franchised business of fitness club and spa” with that of the definition of franchise business  which as per schedule A includes “Gym Membership, personal training etc. any other business activities carried out in the club duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time.” Thus, in totality the reading of the Annexure A along with the definition of expression ‘Franchised business’ would make the said definition inclusive in nature which may include any other business activities carried out in the club duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time. The said aspect is significant especially considering the term of the agreement which is 12 years from the date of the agreement and thus the franchised business by the very definition read with Annexure A under the agreement would not merely be confined to the acts of fitness center and spa but would also include any other business activities permitted by the franchisor in future from time to time to be carried out within the club. This also means that the definition of the expression franchised business is not static in nature as on the date of the execution of the agreement but would also include all the acts which the franchisor may agree to permit the franchisee to carry out within the club after forming the consensus with the franchisee even after the date of the execution of the agreement as this inclusive definition of franchised business as business duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time leave a room within the scope to cover future permitted acts.  c)  The later part of the Annexure A also provides that the franchisor is engaged in the business of skin care, beauty care, hair care salon and if the franchisee opts into this business, he shall essentially be required to apply for the separate franchise of the salon business with the franchisor and pay to the franchisor the prescribed fee separately. This clause in Annexure A mandates that the franchisee is required to opt for the business of the salon and he shall require for separate franchise for the salon business and shall pay prescribed franchise fee separately.",

Though, it is case of the plaintiff that the defendants continued to operate the OZONE Spa even as on March, 2015 or immediately prior to the incorporation of the defendants company namely Headmaster Salon Pvt. Ltd. in the month of May, 2015. It was put to the counsel for the defendants in the Court as to whether the defendants have ever operated salon under the name and style of OZONE at the premises located at 23, NWA, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi where the fitness center and Spa of the franchised business is located, the learned counsel for the defendants responded that the business of OZONE Salon was carried on between December, 2013 to December, 2014 thereafter, the defendants proceeded to wind up the said business. However, as per the case of the defendants the royalty/revenue sharing of the said business was only done for the period of 3 months and not thereafter as the said business was not falling within the scope of the Franchise Agreement dated 5th November 2012.

                        "content": "Now, if one were to examine the combined effect of the three agreements as they existed at the relevant time and to put the things in perspective in view of the happenings of the events so transpired sequentially, the same can be done by arranging and analysing them in the following manner :  a)  No doubt that the Franchise Agreement dated 5th November 2012 between the plaintiff and defendants grants the franchise to the defendants to operate the fitness center and spa for the period of 12 years. The definition of the expression of ‘Franchised business’ read alongside with the Annexure A clearly covers any other business activities  carried out in the club, duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time. Thus, the definition of the franchise business was not static as on 5th November 2012 but can also include the further permission which can be granted by the plaintiff to the defendants by mutually forming the consensus.  b)  It is also true that as on the date of execution of the agreement dated 5th November 2012, the business of Salon was not included in the franchise business and it was left to the option of the defendants/ franchisee to opt to enter into this business and for which he can apply for separate franchisee for salon business and pay the fees separately in this respect. This position was existing as on 5th November 2012.  c)  Even if it is to be assumed that the franchise business as on 5th November 2012 did not explicitly contain the word “Salon” within its sweep, still the definition of the franchise business on the combined reading of Annexure A and the definition clause clearly permits any other business activities to be carried on in the club duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time. This business activity would include the activity of Salon to be carried on in the premises of the club as the Salon is ancillary and connected activity to be carried out in the club only.  d)  Consequently, by entering into the Management Agreement dated 1st April 2013 which is in continuation of the Franchise Agreement dated 5th November 2012 containing the express  provision/ clause for revenue sharing for Salon activities and any other business activity by virtue of its clause 2 would be clearly termed as option of entering into salon exercised by the defendants which was duly availed by the defendants as the franchisee by opening the Salon in the month of December 2013 later and paying the royalty/ revenue sharing as acknowledged by the defendants through its counsel as recorded above. The said business activity is in turn permitted by the plaintiff by entering into Management Agreement dated 1st April 2013 which is in continuation of the Franchise Agreement and nowhere effected the Franchise Agreement and rather acknowledged that the terms of the Franchise Agreement would continue to bind the parties. In such circumstances, the business activities of the Salon though initiated later on in November/December 2013 but in consonance with the management agreement dated 1st April 2013 which provides for revenue sharing for Salon would thus fall within the ambit of the Annexure A to the agreement dated 5th November 2012 as the activity permitted by the plaintiff as licensor/franchisor to the defendants as a franchisee and the same was also acted upon between the parties by opening of the Salon in the month of November/December 2013 pursuant thereto and thus would fall in the inclusive definition of franchise business permitted from time to time. It is also pertinent to mention that as the said permission is given by the plaintiff during the  subsistence of the term of 12 years of Franchise Agreement and thus would be termed as valid permission in terms of the agreement and would fall within the ambit of the franchised business.  e)  The plea of the defendants that the Salon business was excluded and was at the option of the defendants wherein the defendants as a franchisee has to apply for separate franchise for Salon business and pay separate prescribed fee for the same is not satisfied in the present case and is also unsustainable. This is due to the reason that it is true that the Annexure A provided for such provision to opt for entering into the business of Salon by the defendants/franchisee by seeking the permission separately and pay separate fees. However, the mere fact that the said permission was required to be sought separately does not imply that the said franchise has to be necessarily form the subject matter of the separate agreement dehors the franchise agreement dated 5th November 2012 and more so when the definition of the franchise business is inclusive enough to cover any other business activities carried out in the club duly permitted by the franchisor from time to time.  f)  It is a settled principle of law that one has to give the effect to each and every clause of the agreement so as to make the agreement workable and no clause of the agreement should be left redundant or dead letter or inoperative or otiose and the interpretation to the effect of making the clauses  operational should be preferred over the one which leads to redundancy. Applying the said principle of law to the facts of the present case, once there exists a definition of the franchised business clearly allowing any other business activity to be carried out at the club and simultaneously mandated the franchisee to separately apply for the franchise for the salon business and pay the prescribed fee separately, it does not imply that the salon activity cannot be applied separately by the defendants as a franchisee and the same cannot be permitted by the plaintiff as franchisor within purview of the same agreement. The fact that the defendants proceeded to enter into the Management Agreement in continuation of the Franchise Agreement with the plaintiff dated 1st April, 2013 containing the express provision of revenue sharing of the Salon business and later on also proceeded to open the Salon in the month of December, 2013 under the mark OZONE in terms of the said permission and thereafter paid the royalty/revenue sharing under the separate head of the Salon business is sufficient compliance of the last paragraph of Annexure A. After all, the last paragraph of Annexure A never contemplated a separate agreement and only provided a separate permission and separate fees. Therefore, the plea of the defendants that the franchised business does not include Salon business as it was expressly excluded is untenable. The same was never excluded but it was only agreed that the permission was  required separately and the same was given later on which was availed of by the defendants themselves.  g)  Even in practice and implementation the Salon activity is not such which is treated totally outside or alien to the activity of fitness and spa. The pictures of the hoardings/ premises of the defendants produced along with the list of the documents show that intention of the parties is to treat the business fitness, salon and spa together and collectively. This can be seen from the local commissioners’ report wherein outside the building it is prominently written “OZONE” “FITNESS SALON SPA” prominently and all these activities are run within the same premises and connected to each other. In such circumstances, treating the business of Salon as something which is totally divorced from the Fitness and SPA as something which would be requiring a totally new agreement when the said activities are the one which can be categorised as any other business activities to be carried out at the club would be totally impracticable and would be against the will of the parties when the parties understood the said businesses are to be carried out at the same premises within the same club though at the different floors. Therefore, the said view of terming a “separate franchise” existing in Annexure A as something warranting different agreement and thus cannot be falling within the same agreement when parties were at ad idem at the relevant time between 2013 to  2014 and the Franchise Agreement permits so would be far fetched and cannot be accepted.  h)  It is also true that the Management Agreement was abrogated by virtue of the entering into Supplementary Agreement dated 29th March 2014. However, the said abrogation merely altered the financial terms between the parties from paying the royalty from percentage basis of the turnover of the respective businesses to fixed royalty/ fees. The said alteration nowhere again excludes the payment towards the Salon business which was earlier also paid by the defendants to the plaintiff in the intervening period between December 2013 uptil the entering of the Supplementary Agreement. Once, the defendants agreed to pay the royalty or revenue sharing towards salon business under the Management Agreement, the Supplementary Agreement which substituted the Management Agreement would implicitly inferred to include the will/ consensus between the parties towards payment of the royalty for Salon business as well. This is more so when both the parties formed consensus to proceed to go ahead with the working arrangement, then it shall be deemed that the fixed royalty/ fee computed under the Supplementary Agreement would include the fees for Salon business as well. No contrary inference can be drawn in the absence of any stipulation speaking to the contrary in the Supplementary Agreement.  i)  Further, the mere abrogation of the Management Agreement as on date does not deprive the Court to analyse the events so transpired between the parties in the past and at the relevant time nor does it wipe out the consent provided by the defendants agreeing to share the revenue for the Salon business between 2013 uptil the entering into the Supplementary Agreement dated 29th March 2014. The said consensus ad idem was understood by both the parties and the defendants in fact thereafter open the Salon business on behalf of the plaintiff and thereafter acted upon the terms of the Management Agreement by paying the royalty/ sharing the revenue with the plaintiff for whatsoever months be it 12 or 13 which is disputed point between the parties. But the fact remains that both the parties understood the agreement in the same manner and proceeded on the same lines. It is altogether different matter that later on dispute arose between the parties resulting into entering of the Supplementary Agreement. All this makes it clear that the Salon business was considered as the part of the management agreement entered into between the parties which is a continuation of the franchise agreement and was acted upon by the parties. This also answers the plea of the defendants that Salon business was run by the defendants on adhoc understanding between the parties. The answer is that it was never the oral or adhoc understanding between the parties but due to contractual obligations contained in the  management agreement which mandated the defendants to open the Salon and pay the royalty as well under the separate head till the time of entering into the supplementary agreement.  j)  The following decisions are referred by the plaintiff’s counsel on this issue:- i.  In Abdulla Ahmed vs. Animendra Kissen Mitter (supra) it was held as under:  \"27. The subsequent conduct of both the parties to the agreement very strongly supports this view. The evidence of such conduct is relevant in this case because, as pointed out by Viscount Simon, L.C., in the case already referred to, the phrase “finding a purchaser” is itself not without ambiguity. Here the phrase is “securing a purchaser”. This phrase similarly is not without ambiguity. The evidence of conduct of the parties in this situation as to how they understood the words to mean can be considered in determining the true effect of the contract made between the parties. Extrinsic evidence to determine the effect of an instrument is permissible where there remains a doubt as to its true meaning. Evidence of the acts done under it is a guide to the intention of the parties in such a case and particularly when acts are done shortly after the date of the instrument. (Vide para 343 of Hailsham Edn. of Halsbury, Vol. 10, p. 274).\"  ii.  In The Godhra Electricity Co. Ltd. and Anr. Vs. State of Gujarat and Anr. (supra) it was held as under :  \"11. In the process of interpretation of the terms of a contract, the court can frequently get great assistance from the interpreting statements made  by the parties themselves or from their conduct in rendering or in receiving performances under it. Parties can, by mutual agreement, make their own contracts; they can also by mutual agreement remake them. The process of practical interpretation and application, however, is not regarded by the parties as a remaking of the contract; nor do the courts so regard it. Instead, it is merely a further expression by the parties of the meaning that they give and have given to the terms of their contract previously made. There is no good reason why the courts should not give great weight to these further expressions by the parties, in view of the fact that they still have the same freedom of contract that they had originally. The American Courts receive subsequent actings as admissible guides in interpretation. It is true that one party cannot build up his case by making an interpretation in his own favour. It is the concurrence therein that such a party can use against the other party. This concurrence may be evidence by the other party's express assent thereto, by his acting in accordance with it, by his receipt without objection of performances that indicate it, or by saying nothing when he knows that the first party is acting on reliance upon the interpretation (see Corbin on Contracts, Vol. 3, pp.249 & 254-56).",

                        "content": "We are not certain that if evidence of subsequent acting under a document is admissible, it might have the result that a contract would mean one thing on the day it is signed but by reason of subsequent event it would mean something a month or year later. Subsequent “interpreting” statements might not always change the meaning of a word or a phrase. A word or a phrase is not always crystal clear. When both parties subsequently say that by the word or  phrase which, in the context, is ambiguous, they meant this, it only supplies a glossary as to the meaning of the word or phrase. After all, the inquiry is as to what the intention of the parties was from the language used. And, why is it that parties cannot clear the latent ambiguity in the language by a subsequent interpreting statement? If the meaning of the word or phrase or sentence is clear, extrinsic evidence is not admissible. It is only when there is latent ambiguity that extrinsic evidence in the shape of interpreting statement in which both parties have concurred should be admissible. The parties themselves might not have been clear as to the meaning of the word or phrase when they entered into the contract. Unanticipated situation might arise or come into the contemplation of the parties subsequently which would sharpen their focus and any statement by them which would illuminate the darkness arising out of the ambiguity of the language should not be shut out. In the case of an ambiguous instrument, there is no reason why subsequent interpreting statement should be inadmissible.  “The question involved is this: Is the fact that the parties to a document, and particularly to a contract, have interpreted its terms in a particular way and have been in the habit of acting on the document in accordance with that interpretation, any admissible guide to the construction of the document? In the case of an unambiguous document, the answer is ‘No.’ (See Odgers' Construction of Deeds and Statutes, 5th Edn. by G. Dworkin, pp. 118-19).”  But, as we said, in the case of an ambiguous one, the answer must be “yes”. In Lamb v. Goring Brick Co. [(1932) 1 KB 710, 721] a selling agency contract contained the words “the price shall be  mutually agreed”. Documents showing the mode adopted for ascertaining the price were put in evidence without objection. In the court of appeal Greer, L.J. said:  “In my opinion, it is not necessary to consider how this contract was acted on in practice. If there had been an ambiguity and the intention of the parties had been in question at the trial, I think it might have been held that the parties had placed their own construction on the contract and, having acted upon a certain view, had thereby agreed to accept it as the true view of its meaning.”",

Sears [(1837) 6 Ad & El 469] and its gradual elaboration until placement of its true principles by the Privy Council in the case ofSarat Chunder Dey v. Gopal Chunder Laha [(1891-92) 19 IA 203 : ILR 20 Cal 296] whereas earlier Lord Esher in the case of Seton. Laing Co. v. Lafone [(1887) 19 QBD 68 : 56 LJQB 415 :  57 LT 547 (CA)] evolved three basic elements of the doctrine of estoppel to wit:  “Firstly, where a man makes a fraudulent misrepresentation and another man acts upon it to its true detriment: Secondly, another may be where a man makes a false statement negligently though without fraud and another person acts upon it: And thirdly, there may be circumstances under which, where a misrepresentation is made without fraud and without negligence, there may be an estoppel.”  Lord Shand, however, was pleased to add one further element to the effect that there may be statements made, which have induced other party to do that from which otherwise he would have abstained and which cannot properly be characterised as misrepresentation. In this context, reference may be made to the decisions of the High Court of Australia in the case of Craine v. Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. [(1920) 28 CLR 305] Dixon, J. in his judgment in Grundt v. Great Boulder Gold Mines Pty. Ltd. [(1939) 59 CLR 641] stated that:  “In measuring the detriment, or demonstrating its existence, one does not compare the position of the representee, before and after acting upon the representation, upon the assumption that the representation is to be regarded as true, the question of estoppel does not arise. It is only when the representor wished to disavow the assumption contained in his representation that an estoppel arises, and the question of detriment is considered, accordingly, in the light of the position which the representee would be in if the representor  were allowed to disavow the truth of the representation.”  (In this context see Spencer Bower and Turner: Estoppel by Representation, 3rd Edn.) Lord Denning also in the case of Central Newbury Car Auctions Ltd. v. Unity Finance Ltd. [(1956) 3 All ER 905] appears to have subscribed to the view of Lord Dixon, J. pertaining to the test of “detriment” to the effect as to whether it appears unjust or unequitable that the representator should now be allowed to resile from his representation, having regard to what the representee has done or refrained from doing in reliance on the representation, in short, the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment. So long as the assumption is adhered to, the party who altered the situation upon the faith of it cannot complain. His complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs, the basis of an assertion of right against him then, if it is allowed, his own original change of position will operate as a detriment (vide Grundts: High Court of Australia [(1939) 59 CLR 641] ).",

                        "content": "Phipson on Evidence (14th Edn.) has the following to state as regards estoppels by conduct.  “Estoppels by conduct, or, as they are still sometimes called, estoppels by matter in pais, were anciently acts of notoriety not less solemn and formal than the execution of a deed, such as livery of seisin, entry, acceptance of an estate and the like, and whether a party had or had not concurred in an act of this sort was deemed a  matter which there could be no difficulty in ascertaining, and then the legal consequences followed. (Lyon v. Reed [(1844) 13 M&W 285] M&W at p. 309). The doctrine has, however, in modern times, been extended so as to embrace practically any act or statement by a party which it would be unconscionable to permit him to deny. The rule has been authoritatively stated as follows: ‘Where one by his words or conduct wilfully causes another to believe the existence of a certain state of things and induces him to act on that belief so as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded from averring against the latter a different state of things as existing at the same time.’ (Pickard v. Sears [(1837) 6 Ad & El 469] A&E at p. 474). And whatever a man's real intention may be, he is deemed to act wilfully ‘if he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take the representation to be true and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it’. (Freeman v. Cooke [(1848) 2 Exch 654 : 18 LJEx 114] : Exch at p. 663)  Where the conduct is negligent or consists wholly of omission, there must be a duty to the person misled (Mercantile Bank v. Central Bank [1938 AC 287 : (1938) 1 All ER 52 : 107 LJPC 25 : 158 LT 269 (PC)] AC at p. 304 and National Westminster Bank v. Barclays Bank International [1975 QB 654 : (1974) 3 All ER 834 : (1975) 2 WLR 12] ). This principles sits oddly with the rest of the law of estoppel, but it appears to have been reaffirmed, at least by implication, by the House of Lords comparatively recently (Moorgate Mercantile Co. Ltd. v.Twitchings [1977 AC 890 : (1976) 2 All ER 641 : (1976) 3 WLR 66 (HL)] ). The explanation is no doubt that this aspect of estoppel is properly to be considered a  part of the law relating to negligent representations, rather than estoppel properly so-called. If two people with the same source of information assert the same truth or agree to assert the same falsehood at the same time, neither can be estopped as against the other from asserting differently at another time (Square v. Square [1935 P 120 : 104 LJP 46 : 153 LT 79] ).”",

                        "content": "A bare perusal of the same would go to show that the issue of an estoppel by conduct can only be said to be available in the event of there being a precise and unambiguous representation and on that score a further question arises as to whether there was any unequivocal assurance prompting the assured to alter his position or status. The contextual facts however, depict otherwise. Annexure 2 to the application form for benefit of price protection contains an undertaking to the following effect :  “We hereby undertake to refund to EEPC Rs … the amount paid to us in full or part thereof against our application for price protection. In terms of our application dated against exports made during … In the case any particular declaration/certificate furnished by us against our above-referred to claims are found to be incorrect or any excess payment is determined to have been made due to oversight/wrong calculation etc. at any time. We also undertake to refund the amount within 10 days of receipt of the notice asking for the refund, failing which the amount erroneously paid or paid in excess shall be recovered from or adjusted against any other claim for export benefits by EEPC or by the licensing authorities of CCI & C.”  and it is on this score it may be noted that in the event of there being a specific undertaking to refund for any amount erroneously paid or paid in excess (emphasis supplied), question of there being any estoppel in our view would not arise. In this context correspondence exchanged between the parties are rather significant. In particular letter dated 30-11-1990 from the Assistant Development Commissioner for Iron & Steel and the reply thereto, dated 8-3-1991 which unmistakably record the factum of non-payment of JPC price.\"",

The said business activities of Salon were in fact allowed by the plaintiff to be carried on by the defendants between December, 2013 to December, 2014 or for that matter May 2015, when the defendants discontinued using Salon business under  the mark OZONE and on the contrary started diverting the customers to its own Salon under the mark HAIR MASTERS by inducing the customers visiting the clubs to offer them discounts or asking them to go the defendants salon under the mark Hair master during the subsistence of valid and subsisting arrangement between the plaintiff and defendants as franchisor and franchisee respectively under the franchised business. Thus, the said acts of the defendants by forming a new company under the name Hair Masters Salon Private Limited in the month of May 2015 and thereafter proceeding to do the business of salon services in neighbourhood in Punjabi Bagh and also creating misrepresentation by mixing up the franchised business with that of the defendants’ own business is clearly in violation of the clause 5.2 which prohibits the defendants not to run or operate or offer any services described in Schedule A or within or outside the territory which is 4 kilometers from the specified location or outside. Further, the said business activities are also in violation of the non compete clause contained under clause 17.1 which prohibits the defendants to carry on, own or engage in or have any interest in any other similar or competing franchised business as in schedule A during the term of the agreement. Prima facie, the business activities of the defendants especially pursuant to forming of the company and proceeding to carry on their own business of Salon under the mark Hairmasters which is a competing business to that of the plaintiff and that to the detriment of the plaintiff and causing losses to the plaintiff is in the breach of the express terms of the franchise agreement including the non compete clause which is valid and subsisting.",

It is already indicated in the analysis done by me above that the services of salon by virtue of entering into Management Agreement would be termed as franchised business under the Franchise Agreement in view of the non static definition of the expression franchised business under the Franchise Agreement leaving the room for permission for future business in the club. Considering the same, the injunction should follow or be confirmed as a matter of course considering the statement of Mr. Dave and my finding to the said effect.

Generally speaking, the negative covenants operative during the term of the contract are not hit by S.27 of the Contract Act because they are designed to fulfil the contract and not to restrict them.... This distinction which is of a fundamental nature has to be borne in mind; otherwise the perspective will be lost.... the restraints which operate during the term of the contract have to fulfil one kind of purpose viz. Furthering the contract. On the other hand, the restraints operative after the termination of the contract strive to secure freedom from competition from a person who no longer works within the contract....\" (Emphasis supplied)",

In other words, no employee can be confronted with the situation where he has to either work for the present employer or be forced to idleness;  iii)  While construing a restrictive or negative covenant and for determining whether such covenant is in restraint of trade, business or profession or not, the courts take a stricter view in employer-employee contracts than in other contracts, such as partnership contracts, collaboration contracts, franchise contracts, agency/distributorship contracts, commercial contracts. The reason being that in the latter kind of contracts, the parties are expected to have dealt with each other on more or less an equal footing, whereas in employer-employee contracts, the norm is that the employer has an advantage over the employee and it is quite often the case that employees have to sign standard form contracts or not be employed at all;  iv)  The question of reasonableness as also the question of whether the restraint is partial or complete is not required to be considered at all whenever an issue arises as to whether a particular term of a contract is or is not in restraint of trade, business or profession.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

This is subject to the proviso that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him. The Court is, however, not bound to grant an injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative covenant would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee either to idleness or to serve the employer.” (See : Ehrman v.

Let me now evaluate the case of the parties in the present case. The plaintiff has prima facie case in the present case as the plaintiff is the licensor/ franchisor of the business, know how, intellectual property rights in relation to fitness center, spa and salon by way of the Franchising Agreement containing a non compete clause during the term of the agreement and even after the same. As indicated above, prima facie, by entering into the Management Agreement dated 1st April, 2013 containing the terms of revenue sharing of Salon services and thereafter by acting upon the same by  opening the Salon on behalf of the plaintiff, the defendants have agreed to become the licensee/ franchisee of the plaintiff and the said business would fall within the purview of the franchised business under Annexure A of the Franchisee Agreement dated 12th November 2012 in view of the inclusive definition of franchised business provided under the agreement. The balance of the convenience would also lie favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants as the defendants have been doing the business on behalf of the plaintiff for fitness services, spa and salon uptil recently when the defendants have incorporated its own company in May 2015 and also filed the trademark application claiming the use since April 2015 for Salon services. In such circumstances, the defendants would be less inconvenienced if they are prevented from doing the competing business of Salon services with that of the plaintiff in a valid and subsisting contract containing a non compete clause when they are recent entrant in the market. Rather, it would be in the interest of the fulfilment of the obligation under the commercial contract, if the defendants are directed to continue with the valid agreement between the plaintiff by not doing unfair competing business with that of the plaintiff. The irreparable loss would accrue to the plaintiff and even has already been accrued to plaintiff as the Salon services of the plaintiff has already suffered prejudicially from the acts of the defendants wherein the defendants have malafidely diverted customers of the plaintiff by inducing them to visit their own Salon instead of the plaintiff and have caused losses to the plaintiff and the further continuance of the same would cause further loss to  customer base and would enable the defendants to further flout the valid contract between the parties. On the contrary, there is no serious harm to the defendants, if they are directed to proceed in terms of the franchise agreement and not engage in to the competing business. Therefore, the present case is such where interest of the justice requires that the interim injunction should be granted to restrain the defendants from engaging themselves into any competing business with that of the plaintiff either directly or indirectly during the term of the contract especially when the defendants have signed commercial contract with open eyes and were following the terms of the agreement uptil recently when they became dishonest and started competing with the plaintiff in breach of the terms of the Franchise Agreement dated 5th November, 2012.",

In 'Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names'-pages 42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated here as under:  \"The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general proposition -no man may pass off his goods as  those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed.

Even an impression was also given on behalf of the plaintiff that it may be very less and unreasonable if service of salon is operated from the new place and the plaintiff would not charge any extra royalty if said services are provided from the basement of franchisee premises. But both the suggestions were not acceptable to the defendants. Dr. Singhvi submits that under this situation of refusal of suggestion, the plaintiff cannot allow the defendants to run parallel business, otherwise, all the franchisees would do the same activities in order to avoid paying the royalty to the plaintiff despite of agreement and the plaintiff who has the exclusive rights in the intellectual property in this trade, confidentiality and trade secrets, without any fault, would suffer loss in its business. Dr. Singhvi says that in order to show the hardship, the defendants very clearly in their pleadings gave an impression to the Court that defendant No.3 had already given the franchise agreements to third parties, i.e. at Chandigarh and Ashok Vihar (New Delhi) by placing the photographs that those premises are ready for operation of salon business.",

The defendant No.3, who was sitting in the Court, was unable to assure to the Court to produce copies thereof. All this clearly show that the defendants are attempting to rest their case on the falsity by showing some sense of the urgency in vacation of the injunction, when on balance of convenience, the defendants are the recent entrant in the business in the month of April and May 2015 and the entire aim seems to damage the goodwill of the plaintiff and earn easy profits out of the same when the defendants are also contractually bound by the agreement and not indulge into such acts.",

The said statement is not such which is aimed at to deliberately misrepresent the Court in order to secure any advantage over the defendants. On the contrary, I have interpreted all the three agreements by meaningfully reading them collectively and found that the definition of the franchised business under the Franchise Agreement is not static as on the execution of the agreement but shall also take into consideration the other permissions of the businesses which may be given by the plaintiff as a licensor to the defendants as a licensee from time to time. Going by the same, the statement that the Salon services are included in the franchise agreement is at the highest inaccuracy or something which is subject to interpretation of the contracts entered into between the parties and cannot be said to be misstatement which would be such that would enable the Court to vacate the injunction on count of the misrepresentation.",

However, considering the nature of the covenants contained in the franchise agreement and to balance out the competing interests between the parties, the order dated 24th June, 2015 requires slight modification. This is due to the reason that the Franchise Agreement is to operate the franchise in the form of franchised business only for the  designated territory or within the range of four kilometres of the designated territory as provided in Schedule C of the agreement. Therefore, the corresponding restriction to operate the said services upon the defendants in the competing business during the term of the agreement has also to be within the designated territory or within the range of 4 kms thereafter which should be fair, just and reasonable as the absolute restriction on the basis of negative covenant without any affirmative covenant corresponding to the same would be too harsh upon the defendants and would be even greater than the licensed area. Therefore, there shall be an interim order against the defendants till the decision of the suit or subsisting period of Franchisee Agreement whichever is earlier to the following effect with the modified terms:  a)  The defendants, their partners, directors or any person acting on their behalf are restrained till the time the present suit is decided finally from establishing, running, setting up any competing business including fitness centers, salons, spas under the name Hairmasters or any other name at the premises located at 23, NWA, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi-110026 or any area which falls within the range of 4 kms from the said premises  b)  The defendants, their partners, directors or any person acting on their behalf are restrained till the time the present suit is decided finally from establishing, running, setting up any competing business including fitness centers, salons, spas under the name Hairmasters or any other name at the areas/  premises where the plaintiff salons, fitness centers and spas are located or their franchisees are carrying their business or any nearby area which falls within 4 km of the said premises which may prevent any such false association or misrepresentation in the course of the trade and unfair competition thereof between the plaintiff and defendants.  c)  The defendants, their partners, directors or any persons acting on their behalf are restrained till the time suit is decided finally from providing any coupons, brochures, cards, other stationary material to any of the customers visiting the franchised premises indicating the connection of the franchised business with that of the defendant’s business under the mark Hairmaster or causing any connection and affiliation with that of the plaintiff by showing common employees or any other sort of the connection so as to cause confusion and deception amongst the customers and resultant diversion of their customers to the defendants.",

It is settled law, and it was so clearly recognised in Raj Narain's case : [1975]3SCR333 (supra) that there may be classes of documents which public interest requires should not be disclosed, no matter what the individual documents in those classes may contain or in other words, the law recognises that there may be classes of documents which in the public interest should be immune from disclosure. There is one such class of documents which for years has been recognised by the law as entitled in the public interest to be protected against disclosure and that class consists of documents which it is really necessary for the proper functioning of the public service to withhold from disclosure. The documents falling within this class are granted immunity from disclosure not because of their contents but because of the class to which they belong. This class includes cabinet minutes, minutes of discussions between heads of departments, high level interdepartmental communications and dispatches from ambassadors abroad (vide : Conway v. Rimmer 1968 AC 910 and Reg v. Lewes J.K. Ex parte Home Secy. 1973 AC 388). Papers brought into existence for the purpose of preparing a submission to cabinet (vide Commonwealth Lanyon Property Ltd. v. Commonwealth 129 LR 650) and indeed any documents which relate to the framing of government policy at a high level (vide: Re Grosyenor Hotel. London). It would seem that according to the decision in Sodhi Sukhdev Singh's case AIR 1961 SC 4931 (supra) this class may also extend to \"notes and minute made by the respective officers on the relevant files, information expressed or reports made and gist of official decisions reached\" in the course of determination of questions of policy Lord Reid in Conway v. Rimmer (supra) at page 952 proceeded also to include in this class \"all documents concerned with policy-making within  departments including, it may be minutes and the fire by quite junior officials and correspondence with outside bodies\". It is not necessary for us for the purpose of this case to consider what documents legitimately belong to this class so as to be entitled to immunity from disclosure, irrespective of what they contain. But. it does appear that cabinet, papers, minutes of discussions of heads of departments and high level documents relating to the inner working of the government machine or Concerned with the framing of government policies belong to this class which in the public interest must be regarded as protected against disclosure.

Now the view taken in Sodhi Sukhdev Singh's case: [1961]2SCR371 was that where an objection is raised against the disclosure of a document under Section the Court has no power to inspect the document under Section for the purpose of deciding the objection. But with the greatest respect to the learned Judges who decided that case, we do not think this view is correct and in fact subsequent decisions of this Court seem to be against it. So far as English Law is concerned it is now well-settled as a result of the decision of the House of Lords in Conway v. Rimmer 1968 AC 910 (supra) that there is a residual power in the Court to inspect the document. If the Court finds it necessary to do so for the purpose of deciding whether on balance the disclosure of the document would cause greater injury to public Interest than its non-disclosure, vide Conway v. Rimmer (supra) at pages 953, 979, 981 and 993. This residual power of the Court to inspect the document has also be recognised in  162",

We do not see any reason why under Indian Law the Court should be denied this residual power to inspect the document. It is true that under Section the Court cannot inspect the document if it relates to affairs of State, but this bar comes into operation only if the document is established to be one relating to affairs of State. If, however, there is any doubt whether the document does relate to affairs of State, the residual power which vests in the Court to inspect the document for the purpose of determining whether the disclosure of the document would be injurious to public interest and the document is therefore one relating to affairs of State, is not excluded by Section This Court in fact held in no uncertain terms in Raj Narain's case : [1975]3SCR333 (supra) where an objection against the disclosure of the Blue Book was taken on behalf of the State under Section that if the Court was not satisfied with the affidavit objecting to the disclosure of the document, the Court may inspect the document. Ray, C.J, observed at two places while dealing with the objection against the disclosure of the Blue Book under Section that \"If the Court would yet like to satisfy itself, the Court may see the document. This will be the inspection of the document by the Court,\" and \"If the Court in spite of the affidavit wishes to inspect the document, the Court may do so.\" Mathew, J. also pointed out that in Amarchand Butail v. Union of India : AIR1964SC1658 this Court inspected the document in order to see whether it related to affairs of State. There can therefore, be no doubt that even where a claim for immunity against disclosure of a document is made under Section the Court may in an appropriate case inspect the document in order to satisfy itself whether its disclosure would, in the particular case before it, be injurious to public interest and the claim for immunity must therefore be upheld....” (emphasis supplied)”",

The claim of the Assessee-Respondent, as is  discernible, is that the assessing officer had treated the transactions keeping in view the concept of business or commercial rights of similar nature and put it in the compartment of intangible assets. To effectively understand what would constitute an intangible asset, certain aspects, like the nature of goodwill involved, how the goodwill has been generated, how it has been valued, agreement under which it has been acquired, what intangible asset it represents, namely, trademark, right, patent, etc. and further whether it would come within the clause, namely, \"any other business or commercial rights which are of similar nature\" are to be borne in mind.",

The tribunal has treated the same to be valuable commercial asset similar to other intangibles mentioned in the definition of the block of assets and, hence, eligible to depreciation. It has also been noted by the tribunal that the said facts were stated by the Assessee in the audit report and the assessing officer had examined the audit report and also made queries and accepted the explanation proffered by the Assessee. The acceptance of the claim of the Assessee by the assessing officer would come in the compartment of taking a plausible view inasmuch as basically intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets that cannot be seen or touched or physical measures which are created through time and / or effort and that are identifiable as a separate asset. They can be in the form of copyrights, patents, trademarks, goodwill, trade secrets, customer lists, marketing rights, franchises, etc. which either arise on acquisition or are internally generated.  32(1)(ii)  32  263",

                        "content": "It is worth noting that the meaning of business or commercial rights of similar nature has to be understood in the backdrop of Section of the Act. Commercial rights are such rights which are obtained for effectively carrying on the business and commerce, and commerce, as is understood, is a wider term which encompasses in its fold many a facet. Studied in this background, any right which is obtained for carrying on the business with effectiveness is likely to fall or come within the sweep of meaning of intangible asset. The dictionary clause clearly stipulates that business or commercial rights should be of similar nature as know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, franchises, etc. and all these assets which are not manufactured or produced overnight but are brought into existence by experience and reputation. They gain significance in the commercial world as they represent a particular benefit or advantage or reputation built over a certain span of time and the customers associate with such assets. Goodwill, when appositely understood, does convey a positive reputation built by a person / company / business concern over a period of time. Regard being had to the wider expansion of the definition after the amendment of Section by the Finance Act (2) 1998 and the auditor's report and the explanation offered before the assessing officer, we are of the considered opinion that the tribunal is justified in holding that if two views were possible and when the assessing officer had accepted one view which is a plausible one, it was not appropriate on the part of the Commissioner to exercise his power under Section solely on the ground that in the books of accounts it was mentioned as \"goodwill\" and nothing else. As has been held by the Apex Court in Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. (supra), Max India Ltd. (supra) and Commissioner of Income Tax v. Vimgi Investment P.Ltd.

In the present case, the Assessing Officer, as a matter of fact, came to the conclusion that no amount was actually paid on account of goodwill. This is a factual finding. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [`CIT(A)', for short] has come to the conclusion that the authorised representatives had filed copies of the Orders of the High Court ordering amalgamation of the above two Companies; that the assets and liabilities of M/s. YSN Shares and Securities Private Limited were transferred to the Assessee for a consideration; that the difference between the cost of an asset and the amount paid constituted goodwill and that the Assessee-Company in the process of amalgamation had acquired a capital right in the form of goodwill because of which the market worth of the Assessee-Company stood increased.

Reference was made to OECD guidelines in paragraphs 6.36 to 6.38; and US IRC Section 482 to the following effect:  ―(a)The US distributor was simply given set transfer price and the development of the US market was at risk and economic cost of the US distributor.

(c)  The foreign parent provided the distributor with a rebate of a portion of the distributor's AMP expenditure based on sales volumes.

                        "content": "The majority judgment in L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd. (supra) had reached the following findings:- (i)  In terms of the Sub-Section 2B to Section 92CA, a TPO could have examined and applied transfer pricing provisions to a transaction, which comes to his notice, in respect of which the assessee has not furnished a report under Section 92E of the Act. Amendment by the Finance Act, 2012 incorporating Sub-Section 2B to Section 92CA was retrospective and applicable with effect from 1st June, 2002. Thus, the TPO could have examined the unreported international transaction relating to the AMP expenses.  (ii)  AMP was an international transaction, given the contours and ambit of the term ‗transaction‘ and ‗international transaction‘ as defined in the Act.  (iii)  The said character as an international transaction cannot be denied or negated because AMP expenditure was incurred in India and was paid by the assessed to independent parties in India.  (iv)  The contention that there was no express agreement apropos brand building for incurring AMP expenses was rejected, holding that such agreement or understanding could be inferred and could also be oral. Reference was made to the definition of the terms ‗transaction‘ and ‗international transaction‘ including the retrospective insertions made by the Finance Act, 2012, to explain the two terms.  (v)  The TPO was entitled to re-categorize any transaction; (i) where the economic substance of the transaction differs from its form; (ii) where the form and substance of the transaction are the same, but the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by an independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. Relying upon the decision of the Delhi High Court in CIT versus EKL Appliances Ltd. [2012] 345 ITR 241 (Del), which refers to the OECD Commentary carving out the two exceptions, it has been held that the second exception was applicable. Thus, the TPO could have re-categorized the international transaction as declared to determine arm‘s length price of the unravelled and deciphered international transaction as per the mandate of Section 92CA(2B) of the Act.  (vi)  In order to determine and decide whether an assessed had an AMP international transaction with an AE, the TPO could rely upon the ‗bright line test‘, both to determine and re-categorize the international transaction, and to compute the contractual value or the price of the said transaction. Application of the ‗bright line test‘ was not contrary to the Act, i.e. the Income Tax Act, 1961.  (vii)  Application of the ‗bright line test‘ was only to segregate the AMP expenses incurred by an assessee for their own business and compute the value or cost of the AMP expenses incurred by the assessee for promoting brand value of the AE, resident abroad.  (viii)  ‗Bright line test‘ does not require statutory endorsement.  (ix)  On application of the ‗bright line test‘, if it is ascertained and deduced that the assessed had incurred non-routine AMP expenses beyond what a  similarly situated independent, non-brand owner Indian distributor would have incurred under the circumstances, this quantum of difference or excessive expenditure should be treated as an independent international transaction of brand building for the foreign AE, the owner of the said trademark or brand.  (x)  The Tribunal did not approve of the benchmarks or the comparables adopted by the TPO to apply the ‗bright line test‘. The said test should be applied by comparative analysis of comparable uncontrolled cases which should be really comparable, i.e. the comparable must deal with the same genus of products; have comparable market share; and the assets employed; the functions performed and the risks assumed should be similar. Paragraph 17.2 reads:  ―17.2. We find that the first step in making comparability analysis, is to find out some comparable uncontrolled cases. It goes without saying that a comparison can be made with the cases which are really comparable. A case is said to be comparable when it is from the same genus of products and also other relevant factors, such as, type of products, market share, assets employed, functions performed and risks assumed, are also similar. Once proper comparable cases are chosen, then the next step is to neutralize the effect of the differences in relevant facts of the case to be compared and the assessee's case, by making suitable plus or minus adjustments.‖  (xi)  The Tribunal enumerated 14 criteria/parameters for selection of comparables for applying the ‗bright line test‘ and determination of the cost/value of the international transaction of brand/logo promotion by incurring AMP expenses by an Indian AE, for its foreign AE. The 14 point criteria stand recorded in paragraph 17.4, which has been quoted below:- ―17.4 In our considered opinion, following are some of the relevant questions, whose answers have considerable bearing on the question of determination of the cost/value of the international transaction of brand/logo promotion through  advertising, marketing and promotion expenses incurred by the Indian associated enterprise for its foreign entity :",

                        "content": "How the brand will be dealt with after the termination of agreement between associated enterprises?‖  (xii)  The contention of the assessee that comparable cases would be those using foreign brand was expressly rejected in paragraph 17.6. The Tribunal rejected the contention of the assessee that they were economic owners of the brand and in commercial sense their right in the brand name / trademark should be accepted.  Concept of economic ownership of a brand, albeit relevant in commercial sense, was not recognized for the purposes of the Act. Retailers or dealers of electronic products etc. who sell branded products do not become economic owners of the branded products sold by them. Paragraph 17.6 reads:  ―17.6. In principle, we accept the contention of the ld. AR about the necessity of choosing properly comparable cases in the first instance before starting the exercise of making comparison of the AMP expenses incurred by them for finding out the amount spent by the assessee for its own business purpose. However the way in which such comparable cases should be chosen, as advocated by the ld. AR, is not acceptable. He submitted that only such comparable cases should be chosen as are using the foreign brand. We find that choosing cases using the foreign brand ex facie cannot be accepted. It is but natural that the AMP expenses of such cases will also include contribution towards brand building of their respective foreign AEs. In such a situation the comparison would become meaningless as their total AMP expenses will stand on the same footing as that of the assessee before the exclusion of expenses in relation to brand building for the foreign AE. The correct way to make a meaningful comparison is to choose comparable domestic cases not using any foreign brand. Of course when effect will be  given to the relevant factors as discussed above, it will correctly reflect the cost/value of international transaction.‖  (xiii)  Contention of the assessee that TNM Method required comparison of overall net profit of the assessee with the comparables, was rejected for the following reasons:  (a)  The TNM Method postulated in the Rule 10B(1)(e) of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (‗Rules‘, for short) stipulates benchmarking of ―a‖ transaction in singular as defined in Rule 10A(d). TNM Method would relate to profit margin of ―a‖ transaction and not net profit of an entity or total sales of the entity.  It is a transaction and not an entity based method.  (b)  Scrutiny of Chapter X of the Act and language of Section 92(3) mandates and sanctions that TNM Method would be applied only on a transactional level and not at the entity level.   (c)  Bunching of international transactions was not permissible and each international transaction has to be separately valued and accordingly arm‘s length price computed. Each transaction should be taken as an independent transaction, for computing arm‘s length price.  (d)  Profit of an entity would depend upon several factors which contribute in earning of profits. Thus, costs of AMP expenses were independent of cost of raw material/products.  (e)  The factum that the assessed had declared an overall higher profit rate in comparison with the comparables was insufficient and sparse. It was certainly not a licence to the assessed to not record the AMP expenses as an international transaction. Benefit, service or facility furnished and provided to the AE resident abroad required compensation at arm‘s length price.  (xiv)  The argument that expenditure incurred on AMP was subsumed and included in the value of the international transaction already disclosed and paid for by the foreign AE, was rejected for there could be no reason or ground for such assumption.  (xv)  The argument of the assessed that under the TNM Method, the net profit of the entity includes the effect of transactions subject matter of arm‘s length price between the two AEs, was also rejected on the ground that the effect of five methods prescribed under Chapter X was towards one end, i.e. determination of arm‘s length price of an international transaction and consequences of each method qua the international transaction cannot be at variance. Thus, TNM Method should not be applied at entity level.  (xvi)  The contention of the assessed that set off or adjustment of ‗excessive‘/‗higher‘ net profit declared on international transactions should be allowed, if the AMP expenses were treated as a separate international transaction, was rejected, relying upon Section 92(3) of the Act. Set off or adjustments cannot be allowed in respect of profits and gains of one international transaction against another international transaction.  (xvii)  The Assessing Officer/ TPO without specific reference had in substance applied the Cost Plus Method (‗CP Method‘, for short) for computing the arm‘s length price of the international transaction, i.e. the AMP transaction between the AE resident abroad and the Indian assessed. The CP Method was one of the methods prescribed in Chapter X of the Act.  (xviii) Mark-up is mandated under the CP Method. The mark-up had not been correctly computed with reference to comparables and, therefore, determination of quantum of mark-up required remand.  (xix)  The matter also required remand as the TPO, while applying the ‗bright line test‘ and computing the arm‘s length value or price of the AMP expenses, had not selected appropriate comparables as per the criteria stipulated in paragraph 17.4 of the majority decision.  (xx)  Effect of the order passed by the Supreme Court, reported as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. versus Addl. CIT, [2011] 335 ITR 121 (SC) on the reasons/ratio expounded by the Delhi High Court in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (supra), was analysed, to hold that the decision of the High Court was not entirely overruled and the ratio decidendi of the Delhi High Court judgment on the question of incurring of the AMP expenditure by the Indian AE, whether it benefits the foreign AE, requirement to compensate the Indian AEs and other legal principles enrolled, were binding. What had been set aside by the Supreme Court were the observations on merits relating to facts, and not law. The legal principles enunciated by the High Court in Maruti Suzuki (supra) were not expressly or impliedly overruled.  (xxi)  AMP expenses would not include direct selling costs like trade or volume discounts, incentives etc. Direct marketing and sale related expenses or discounts/concessions would not form part of the AMP expenses.  (xxii)  Section 37(1) of the Act and the arm‘s length proceedings under Chapter X of the Act, operate independently. The AMP expenses, allowable as expenditure under Section 37(1) of the Act, would not affect determination of the arm‘s length price of an international transaction or  income of the Indian assessee who has to pay tax in India. Accordingly, the TPO was entitled to make adjustment and compute the arm‘s length price, notwithstanding the legal position that AMP expenses were deductible under Section 37(1) of the Act. Determination and, if required, adjustment of the arm‘s length price is the mandate under Chapter X of the Act.",

In this context, it was observed that the subsequent amendment to Section 80HHC in the Act, after the order passed by the Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act, would not determine whether the order passed by the Assessing Officer was erroneous or not. The Commissioner had to record a finding on the date when he passed the order that the order passed by the Assessing Officer was  erroneous. The said pre-requisite was missing, on the date when the order under Section 263 of the Act was passed.",

In the present case, the claim of the assessee is that they had disclosed the international transaction in their report under Section 92E which included AMP expenses incurred by them. This aspect relates to merits, i.e. whether or not there was one composite, bundled or a packaged international transaction, but once for the said transaction a report in Form 92E was submitted, separate reference/approval was not required. Reference of the bundled transaction under sub-section (1) to Section 92CA is sufficient. Section 92CA has to be interpreted pragmatically. Therefore, once reference of a composite/bundled or packaged international transaction is made, it will be difficult for the assessee to contest applicability of sub-section (1) in cases of segregation or when the TPO invokes sub-section (2B) to Section 92CA of the Act. This flaw as it existed stands corrected with insertion of Sub-Section (2B) to Section 92CA with retrospective effect. It clarifies and ‗cures‘ the deficiency and shortcoming of the earlier provision.

Expenditure and decision of the assessee, whether or not to incur the said expenditure; the quantum thereof, cannot be a subject matter of challenge or disallowance by the Assessing Officer, once it is accepted that the expenditure was wholly, i.e. the quantum of expenditure incurred was fully, and exclusively for business purpose. In Sassoon J. Davit & Co. Pvt.

                        "content": "A significant volume of global trade consists of international transfer of goods, services, capital and intangibles. As per the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing, 2013, international transfers within MNE group entities which are called intra group transfers are growing steadily and account for more than 30% of the total international transactions. What is actually paid by one entity to another entity in the intra-group transfer is called the transfer price. Such transactions are controlled transactions because they are between two associated or connected enterprises as distinct from uncontrolled transactions which are between two entities which are not associated and operate on arm‘s length basis. Transfer Pricing adjustment enables the tax administration of a country to correct the transfer price and compute the same on arm‘s length price, to check, avoid and ensure correct payment of taxes. Arm‘s length price in simple words means fair market price. The reason is that each entity belonging to MNE is treated as a separate profit centre and every entity should necessarily make profit and loss at arm‘s length conditions. This is prevented by correcting either under charging or over charging by AE in intra group transactions. The key issue, therefore, in transfer pricing is valuation of the intra group transfers. The arm‘s length principle as set forth in Article 9 of the OECD Model Convention stipulates that ―where conditions are made or imposed between two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profit which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions, having so accrued, may be  included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.‖ The effect of transfer pricing order is to determine whether the transfer price is the same price which would have been agreed for by independent enterprises transacting with each other if the price is determined by market forces. In negates the distortions in the international transaction price when the transaction is between the two AEs. In nutshell, the basis of transfer pricing is that each individual entity must be taxed on the basis that they act at arm‘s length in the transaction with the other AE.",

Thus, the transfer pricing regulations may differ from country to country. In practice, this is partly true. Growing importance of international trade, globalization and rapid rise in the number of MNEs has resulted in exhaustive and meticulous research and studies in this complex area. The transfer pricing methods have seen a measure of standardization, universal recognition and acceptability. Indian transfer pricing regulations have adopted and benefited, from the international framework. The OECD Transfer Pricing guidelines for multinational enterprises and tax administration and United Nations’ Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing do reflect the international understanding on several aspects relating to transfer pricing.

First being to understand the economic significant characteristic of the controlled transaction between the two AEs and the respective roles of the parties thereto. This has reference to the 5 characteristics i.e. (a) characteristic of property or services transferred; (b) functions performed by the parties taking into account assets employed and risk assumed i.e. functional analysis; (c) contractual terms; (d) economic circumstances and (e) business strategies pursued. The second analytical steps is comparison of those conditions of the controlled transactions with uncontrolled transactions i.e. transactions between the two AEs taking into account the economically significant characteristics of the controlled transactions and the respective roles of the 5 comparability factors. The aforesaid analysis, therefore, requires selection of appropriate comparables i.e. an uncontrolled transaction which is to be compared with a tested party. The comparables can be internal i.e. when one of the AEs enters into a similar uncontrolled transaction with an independent enterprise; or external i.e. involving an independent enterprise in the same market or industry. It is obvious that an internal comparable could in several cases be more dependable and reliable, than an external comparable.  A comparable is acceptable, if based upon comparison of conditions a controlled transaction is similar with the conditions in the transactions between independent enterprises. The comparison must be with reference to the comparability analysis as elucidated  in paragraph 5.1.1 of the United Nations Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing. In other words, the economically relevant characteristics of the two transactions being compared must be sufficiently comparable.  This entails and implies that difference, if any, between controlled and uncontrolled transaction, should not materially affect the conditions being examined given the methodology being adopted for determining the price or the margin. When this is not possible, it should be ascertained whether reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of such differences on the price or margin. Thus, identification of the potential comparables is the key to the transfer pricing analysis. As a sequitur, it follows that the choice of the most appropriate method would be dependent upon availability of potential comparable keeping in mind the comparability analysis including befitting adjustments which may be required. As the degree of the comparability increases, extent of potential differences which would render the analysis inaccurate necessarily decreases.",

The characters would include in cases of transfer of tangible property, the physical features of the property, its quality, reliability, availability, volume or supply and in cases of service, the nature and extent of service and in cases of intangible property, the form of transaction, licensing or sale, the type of property, i.e. trademark, patent, knowhow, the duration and degree of patent and anticipated benefits. The function analysis test in selection of the comparables seeks to identify and compare economically significant activities and the responsibilities undertaken, the asset  used and the risk assumed by the parties to the transaction. The functions, which an assessee may perform, would include design, manufacturing, assembling, research and development servicing, purchasing, distribution, marketing, advertising, transportation, etc. The principal function performed by the party under examination should be identified. Adjustments should be made for any material differences from the functions undertaken by the independent comparable enterprise and the tested party.

Contrary intention to exclude this generic rule is not to be lightly inferred. Contrary intention is not assumed or formed by confining attention to a specific provision but it would be apposite to consider the provision in the setting and placement of the legislation.

Net profit record/data is assessable and within reach. It is readily and easily available, entity-wise in the form of audited accounts. The TNM Method is a preferred transfer pricing arm‘s length principle for its proficiency, convenience and reliability. Ideally, in TNM Method preference should be given to internal or in-house comparables. In absence of internal comparables, the taxpayer can and would need to rely upon external comparables, i.e. comparable transactions by independent enterprises. For several reasons, database providers, it is apparent, have the requisite information and data of external comparables to enable comparability analysis of the controlled and uncontrolled transactions with necessary adjustment to obtain reliable results under TNM Method. This method also works to the benefit and advantage of the tax authorities in view of convenience and easier availability of data not only from third party providers, but on their own level, i.e. assessment records of other parties.",

This method is more tolerant to functional differences between controlled and uncontrolled transactions in comparison with resort to gross profit margins. Yet the net profit indicators have potentiality to introduce an element of volatility, primarily for two reasons. Firstly, factors which do not affect gross profit margin and prices can influence net profit indicators due to variation of operating expenses or vice-versa. This potentiality has reference to variation in operational expenses including AMP expenses. The other factors include taxpayers competitive position in the form of price and margins and in some cases, it may be difficult to eliminate or compute the effect of these factors. These difficulties in applying or accepting the TNM Method arise when there is complexity of functions and each party to the transaction(s) makes valuable unique contribution. Reliability of the TNM Method is sufficiently certain where one of the parties makes all contribution involved in the controlled transaction. This is the position even as per the Revenue‘s case in the present set of appeals. Revenue has asserted that the Indian subsidiaries, i.e. the assessees are mere dummies which implement, promote and incur AMP expenses for building brand value of the foreign AE. Value addition for the Indian AE is not pleaded or argued. Selection of the TNM Method where adopted by the assessee remains unchallenged by the TPO/Assessing Officer.",

In fact, when transactions are inter-connected, combined consideration may be the most reliable means of determining the arm‘s length price. There are often situations where closely linked and connected  transactions cannot be evaluated adequately on separate basis. Segmentation may be mandated when controlled bundled transactions cannot be adequately compared on an aggregate basis. Thus, taxpayer can aggregate the controlled transactions if the transactions meet the specified common portfolio or package parameters. For complex entities or where one of the entities is not ‗plain vanilla distributor‘, it should be applied when necessary and applicable comparables on functional analysis, with or without adjustments are available.

Thus, it was observed that the costs including AMP expenses are independent of cost of imported raw material/finished products having some correlation with overall profit. The example highlights the weakness of the TNM Method. The reasoning would be equally valid, where no AMP or ‗brand building‘ expenses are incurred. (See paragraph 21.8 to 22.10 of the majority decision). The net profit margins can be affected by variation of operating expenses. Thus, the requirement to select appropriate comparable and adjustment. It would be inappropriate and unsound to accept comparables, with or without adjustment and apply TNM Method, and yet conjecturise and mistrust the arm‘s length price. TNM Method would not be the most appropriate method when there are considerable value additions by the subsidiary AEs. In paragraph 22.9, the majority decision has observed that all costs including the AMP expenses are independent of cost of material. This indicates that the observations have been made with reference to manufacturing  activities. It would not be appropriate and proper to apply the TNM Method in case the Indian assessed is engaged in manufacturing activities and distribution and marketing of imported and manufactured products, as interconnected transactions. Import of raw material for manufacture would possibly be an independent international transaction viz. marketing and distribution activities or functions.

In case 2, a distributor having significant marketing functions incurs substantial expenditure on AMP, three times more than in case 1, but the purchase price being lower, the Indian AE gets adequately compensated and, therefore, no transfer pricing adjustment is required. In case we treat the AMP expenses in case 2 as Rs.50/-, i.e. identical as case 1 and AMP of Rs.100/-as a separate transaction, the position in case 2 would be:  It is obvious that this would not be the correct way and method to compute the arm‘s length price. The purchase price adjustments/set off would be mandated to arrive at the arm‘s length price, if the AMP expenses are segregated as an independent international transaction. The position may be worse for the assessed, in case the Assessing Officer makes an addition of Rs.100/-and adds 15% thereto by applying CP Method, i.e. Cost Plus Method. Consequently, the addition made would be of Rs.115/-. When Rs.115/-is added to the TNM Method computation of Rs.150/-, it would result in the total income of Rs.265/or a net profit of 26.5%. Even if the Assessing Officer does not reduce the AMP expenses from Rs.150/-to Rs.50/-, while computing the arm‘s length price by applying the TNM Method, it would yet result in unacceptable anomaly for the net profit margin would be Rs.50/-plus Rs.115/-or 16.15% instead of 5%. Besides, the said approach would be illogical and unacceptable for AMP expenses when segregated as an independent international transaction, must be treated so in all aspects. These anomalies arise on account of fact that there was no apportionment and division of the transactional compensation, but the packaged transaction has been bifurcated and divided into two.

Return on these functions when measured with the PLI base in proportion to the net profit margins, would get affected by factors unrelated to arm‘s length pricing, which is a negative factor, and for this reason TNM Method is typically applied when the related parties are engaged in continuous series of transactions and one of the parties controls intangible assets for which arm‘s length price/return is not easy to determine. It is favourable to apply TNM Method when one party is performing routine marketing, distribution and other functions that do not involve control over intangible assets as it allows appropriate return to the party controlling unique or difficult to value intangible assets. Success or efficacy of a particular method would depend upon functional analysis of the tested party and the comparable. Once we accept the comparable on the basis of functional analysis and if required, after making adjustments, then there should be no difficulty in accepting the international transfer price. In case of discrepancy, addition may be justified where the net profit margin declared in the case of the  tested party is lower than the comparable. A comparable should be accepted if it deals with the same or identical or similar property under the same or substantially the same circumstances as the controlled transaction so as to give reliable and more certain measure of arm‘s length result. All methods including the TNM Method acknowledge that there could be difference between tested part and the comparable on functional analysis, but this would not be material where it is possible to reasonably ascertain the effect on account of the differences for which appropriate adjustments can be made. Thus, selection of the comparable depends upon the functional analysis, similarity as to the several factors and whether or not it is possible to make adjustments to account for the material differences in such circumstances to accept or reject a comparable.

A portfolio approach is a business strategy consisting of a taxpayer bundling certain transactions for the purpose of earning an appropriate return across the portfolio rather than necessarily on any single product within the portfolio. For instance, some products may be marketed by a taxpayer with a low profit or even at a loss, because they create a demand for other products and/or related services of the same-taxpayer that are then sold or provided with high profits (e.g. equipment and captive aftermarket consumables, such as vending coffee machines and coffee capsules, or printers and cartridges). Similar approaches can be observed in various industries. Portfolio approaches are an example of a business strategy that may need to be taken -into account in the comparability analysis and when examining the reliability of comparables. See paragraphs 1.59-1.63 on business strategies. However, as discussed in, paragraphs 1.70-1.72, these considerations will not explain continued overall losses or poor performance over time. Moreover, in order to be acceptable, portfolio approaches must be reasonably targeted as they should not be used, to apply a. transfer pricing method at the taxpayer's company-wide level in those cases where different transaction's. have different economic logic and should be segmented.

In some cases, it may not be feasible to evaluate the package as a whole so that the elements of the package must be segregated.

It is a matter of perception and reputation as it reflects customers‘ experience and faith. Brand value is not generated overnight, but is created over a period of time, when there is recognition that the logo or the name guarantees a consistent level of quality and expertise. Leslie de Chernatony and McDonald have described ―a successful brand is an identifiable product, service, person or place, augmented in such a way that the buyer or user perceives relevant, unique, sustainable added values which match their needs most closely.‖ The words of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.1201/1966 decided on 12th February, 1970 in Khushal Khenger Shah versus Mrs. Khorshedbanu Dabida Boatwala, to describe ‗goodwill‘, can be adopted to describe a brand as an intangible asset being the whole advantage of the reputation and connections formed with the customer together with circumstances which make the connection durable. The definition given by Lord MacNaghten in Commissioner of Inland Revenue versus Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd., 1901 AC 217 (223) can also be applied with marginal changes to understand the concept of brand.  In the context of ‗goodwill‘ it was observed:  ―It is very difficult, as it seems to me, to say that goodwill is not property. Goodwill is bought and sold every day. It may be acquired. I think, in any of the different ways in which property is usually acquired. When a man has got it he may keep it as his own. He may vindicate his exclusive right to it if necessary by process of law. He may dispose of it if he will — of course, under the conditions attaching to property of that nature..............What is good-will? It is a thing very easy to describe very difficult to define. It is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation, and connection of a business. It is the attractive force which brings in custom. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate from a  particular centre or source. However, widely extended or diffused its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home to the source from which it emanates. Goodwill is composed of a variety of elements. It differs in its composition in different trades and in different businesses in the same trade. One element may preponderate here and another element there. To analyse goodwill and split it up into its component parts, to pare it down as the Commissioners desire to do until nothing is left but a dry residuum ingrained in the actual place where the business is carried on while everything else is in the air, seems to me to be as useful for practical purposes as it would be to resolve the human body into the various substances of which it is said to be composed. The goodwill of a business is one whole, and in a case like this it must be dealt with as such. For my part, I think that if there is one attribute common to all cases of goodwill it is the attribute of locality. For goodwill has no independent existence. It cannot subsist by itself. It must be attached to a business. Destroy the business, and the goodwill perishes with it, though elements remain which may perhaps be gathered up and be revived again..............‖",

Development of a trademark or goodwill takes place over a passage of time and is a slow ongoing process. In cases of well recognised or known trademarks, the said trademark is already recognised. Expenditures incurred for promoting product(s) with a trademark is for exploitation of the trademark rather than development of its value. A trademark is a market place device by which the consumers identify the goods and services and their source. In the context of trademark, the said mark symbolises the goodwill or the likelihood that the consumers will make future purchases of the same goods or services. Value of the brand also would depend upon and is attributable to intangibles other than trademark. It refers to infrastructure, know-how, ability to compete with the established market leaders. Brand value, therefore, does not represent trademark as a standalone asset and is difficult and complex to determine and segregate its value. Brand value depends upon the nature and quality of goods and services sold or dealt with. Quality control being the most important element, which can mar or enhance the value.",

It represents a coordinated synergetic impact created by assortment largely representing reputation and quality. There are a good number of examples where brands have been built without incurring substantial advertisement or promotion expenses and also cases where in spite of extensive  and large scale advertisements, brand values have not been created. Therefore, it would be erroneous and fallacious to treat brand building as counterpart or to commensurate brand with advertisement expenses. Brand building or creation is a vexed and complexed issue, surely not just related to advertisement. Advertisements may be the quickest and effective way to tell a brand story to a large audience, but just that is not enough to create or build a brand. Market value of a brand would depend upon how many customers you have, which has reference to brand goodwill, compared to a baseline of an unknown brand. It is in this manner that value of the brand or brand equity is calculated. Such calculations would be relevant when there is an attempt to sell or transfer the brand name. Reputed brands do not go in for advertisement with the intention to increase the brand value, but to increase the sales and thereby earn larger and greater profits. It is not the case of the Revenue that the foreign AEs are in the business of sale/transfer of brands.",

An intangible asset should be recognised as an asset, if and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the said asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The estimate would represent the set off of economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of the intangible asset.  At the initial stage, intangible asset should be measured at cost. The above proposition would not apply to internally generated goodwill or brand. Paragraph 35 specifically elucidates that internally generated goodwill should not be recognised as an asset. In some cases expenditure is incurred to generate future economic benefits, but it may not result in creation of an intangible asset in form of goodwill or brand, which meets the recognition criteria under AS-26. Internally generated goodwill or  brand is not treated as an asset in AS-26 because it is not an identifiable resource controlled by an enterprise, which can be reliably measured at cost. Its value can change due to a range of factors. Such uncertain and unpredictable differences, which would occur in future, are indeterminate. In subsequent paragraphs, AS-26 records that expenditure on materials and services used or consumed, salary, wages and employment related costs, overheads, etc. contribute in generating internal intangible asset.

Srinivasa Setty, (1981) 2 SCC 460 (SC), a decision relating transfer to goodwill. Goodwill, it was held, was a capital asset and denotes benefits arising from connection and reputation. A variety of elements go into its making and the composition varies in different trades, different businesses in the same trade, as one element may pre-dominate one business, another element may dominate in another business. It remains substantial in form and nebulous in character. In progressing business, brand value or goodwill will show progressive increase, but in falling business, it may vain. Thus, its value fluctuates from one moment to another, depending upon reputation and everything else relating to business, personality, business rectitude of the owners, impact of contemporary market reputation, etc.  Importantly, there can be no account in value of the factors producing it and it is impossible to predicate the moment of its birth for it comes silently into the world unheralded and unproclaimed. Its benefit and impact need not be visibly felt for some time. Imperceptible at birth, it exits unwrapped in a concept, growing or fluctuating with numerous imponderables pouring into and affecting the business. Thus, the date of acquisition or the date on which it comes into existence is not possible to determine and it is impossible to say what was the cost of acquisition.

Advertisement are issued from time to time and the expenditure is incurred periodically, so that the customers remain attracted and do not forget the product and its qualities. The advertisements published/displayed may not be of relevance or significance after lapse of time in a highly competitive market, wherein the products of different companies compete and are available in abundance. Advertisements and sales promotion are conducted to increase sale and their impact is limited and felt for a short duration. No permanent character or advantage is achieved and is palpable, unless special or specific factors are brought on record. Expenses for advertising consumer products generally are a part of the process of profit earning and not in the nature of capital outlay. The expenses in the present case were not incurred once and for all, but were a periodical expenses which had to be incurred continuously in view of the nature of the business. It was an on-going expense. Given the factual matrix, it is difficult to hold that the expenses were incurred for setting the profit earning machinery in motion or not for earning profits.

The minority opinion is to the contrary. Discussion on this issue would involve several aspects, whether the TPO/Assessing Officer can apply the ‗bright line test‘ to split the AMP expenses, as essential and non-routine; paragraph 17.6 rejecting AEs of reputed brands as comparables; whether the ‗bright line tests‘ comparables mentioned in paragraph 17.4 of the majority decision are justified and correct; whether the CP Method is the appropriate method; and concept and effect of economic ownership of brand. Discussion under the heading ‗I‘ ‗Brand and Brand Building‘, deals and answers several issues. In order to decide remaining aspects, we would like to reproduce the following relevant paragraphs from the majority judgment:  ―9.10. We do not find any force in the contention of the ld. DR that the mere fact of the assessee having spent proportionately higher amount on advertisement in comparison with similarly placed independent entities be considered as conclusive to infer that some part of the  advertisement expenses were incurred towards brand promotion for the foreign AE. Every businessman knows his interest best. It is for the assessee to decide that how much is to be incurred to carry on his business smoothly. There can be no impediment on the power of the assessee to spend as much as he likes on advertisement. The fact that the assessee has spent proportionately more on advertisement can, at best be a cause of doubt for the AO to trigger examination and satisfy himself that no benefit etc. in the shape of brand building has been provided to the foreign AE. There can be no scope for inferring any brand building without there being any advertisement for the brand or logo of the foreign AE, either separately or with the products and name of the assessee. The AO/TPO can satisfy himself by verifying if the advertisement expenses are confined to advertising the products to be sold in India along with the assessee‗s own name. If it is so, the matter ends. The AO will have to allow deduction for the entire AMP expenses whether or not these are proportionately higher. But if it is found that apart from advertising the products and the assessee‗s name, it has also simultaneously or independently advertised the brand or logo of the foreign AE, then the initial doubt gets converted into a direct inference about some tacit understanding between the assessee and the foreign AE on this score. As in the case of an express agreement, the incurring of AMP expenses for brand building draws strength from such express agreement; in the like manner, the incurring of proportionately more AMP expenses coupled with the advertisement of brand or logo of the foreign AE, gives strength to the inference of some informal or implied agreement in this regard.",

                        "content": "The ld. AR has vehemently argued that when the assessee incurred AMP expenses for its business purpose and recorded them as such, the Revenue went wrong in recharacterizing this transaction by splitting it into two parts, viz., one towards advertisement expenses for the assessee‗s business and second towards the brand building for the foreign AE. He fortified this contention by relying on the judgment of EKL Appliances Ltd. (supra). There is absolutely no doubt that para 17 of the judgment unambiguously lays down that the tax administration should not disregard the actual transaction and substitute other transactions for it. However, it is imperative to note that the proposition laid down in para 17 is not infallible or is not an unexceptionable rule. Caveat has been included in the immediately next para no. 18. Two  exceptions have been carved out of the general rule against recharacterization of any transaction as set out in para 17, viz. ―(i) where the economic substance of a transaction differs from its form; and (ii) where the form and substance of the transaction are the same but the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, viewed in their totality differ from those which would have been adopted by the individual enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner.‖ In our considered opinion, the second exception governs the extant situation, as per which, where the form and substance of the transaction are the same, but arrangements made in relation to transaction viewed in totality differ from those which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner. The assessee incurred AMP expenses and explicitly showed them as such. Thus the form of showing the AMP expenses coincides with the substance of the AMP expenses. But the arrangement made in such transaction, viewed in totality, differs from that which would have been adopted by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner. Though the AMP expenses were shown as such but the overt act of showing such expenses as its own is different from what is incurred by independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner, which unearths the covert act of treating the AMP expenses incurred for the brand building for and on behalf of the foreign AE, as also its own. What is relevant to consider is as to whether an independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner would incur the expenses to the extent the assessee has incurred. If the answer to this question is in affirmative, then the transaction cannot be recharacterized. If, however, the answer is in negative, then the transaction needs to be probed further for determining as to whether its recharacterization is required. Such recharacterization can be done with the help of the ratio decidendi of this judgment itself, being, making a comparison with what `independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner‗ would do, tied with the fact of the assessee also simultaneously advertising the brand of its foreign AE. Reverting to the context of AMP expenses, one needs to find out as to how much AMP expenses would independent enterprises behaving in a commercially rational manner, incur. Once by making such a comparison, the result follows that the Indian AE, prominently displaying brand of its Foreign AE in its advertisements, has incurred expenses proportionately more than that incurred by independent enterprises behaving in a commercial rational manner, then it becomes eminent to recharacterize the transaction of total AMP expenses with a view to separate the transaction of brand building for the foreign AE. Even the United Nations Transfer Pricing Manual, which has only a persuasive value, provides for the allocation of such cost between the MNE and its subsidiaries. We, therefore, hold that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, there is a transaction between the assessee and the foreign AE under which the assessee incurred AMP expenses towards promotion of brand which is legally owned by the foreign entity.  Economic vis-à-vis legal ownership of brand",

                        "content": "We do not find any weight in the contention put forth about the economic ownership and legal ownership of a brand. It is not denied that there can be no economic ownership of a brand, but that exists only in a commercial sense. When it comes in the context of the Act, it is only the legal ownership of the brand that is recognized. If we accept the contention of the ld. AR that it be held as an economic owner of the brand or logo of its foreign AE for the purposes of the Act and hence expenses incurred for brand building, which is legally owned by the foreign AE, should be allowed as deduction in its hands, then incongruous results will follow. It is patent that a manufacturer does not ordinarily sells its goods directly to the ultimate customers. There is normally a chain of middlemen ending with retailer. Going by that logic and descending in the line, the distributors or wholesalers to whom the assessee sells its goods, also become economic owners of the brand on the parity of reasoning that they also exploit the brand for the purpose of selling the goods to retailers. Similarly the retailers also become the economic owners of the brand on the premise that on the basis of such brand they are selling the goods to the ultimate customers. All these middlemen and the assessee can be considered as economic owners of the brand only in a commercial sense for the limited purpose of exploiting it for the business purpose, which is otherwise legally owned by the foreign AE. Such economic ownership is nothing more than that. Suppose the foreign company, who is legal owner of the brand, sells its brand to a third party for a particular consideration, can it be said that the Indian assessee or for that purpose the wholesalers or retailers should also get share in the total consideration towards the sale of brand because they were also economic owners of such brand to some extent? The answer is obviously in negative. It is only the foreign enterprise who will recover the entire sale consideration for the sale of brand and will be subjected to tax as per the relevant taxing provisions. There can be no tax liability in the hands of the Indian AE or the wholesalers or the retailers for parting with the economic ownership of such brand under the Act. In that view of the matter we are of the considered opinion that the concept of economic ownership of a brand, albeit relevant in commercial sense, is not recognized for the purposes of the Act. The above discussion leads us to irresistible conclusion that the advertisement done by the assessee also carrying the brand/logo of its foreign AE coupled with the fact that it spent proportionately higher amount on AMP expenses, gives clear inference of a `transaction‗ between the assessee and its AE of building and promoting the foreign brand.",

AR that the legal character of one enterprise can be altered only where the Revenue positively proves the factum of the  existence of influence of the foreign AE over the affairs of the Indian AE in general or in respect of specific transactions. In fact, it is due to this close relation between AEs of MNC that Chapter-X has been enshrined in the Act as an anti-tax avoidance measure. No doubt AEs in India and abroad are two separate legal entities subject to tax in different tax jurisdictions, but the fact that the economic behaviour of one depends on the wish of the other, can never be totally lost sight of. Due to this factor, it becomes significant to verify as to whether the decisions taken by the Indian AE are influenced by its foreign AE. If any decision taken by the Indian AE is found to be uninfluenced, then the transaction is accepted as such by the Revenue at its face value. If however it turns out that the behavior of the Indian  AE has been influenced by the foreign AE, then there arises a need for adjustment to that extent by removing the effect of such influence. In fact, the transfer pricing provisions (hereinafter also called `the TP provisions‗) are aimed at discovering, in the first instance, if there is any influence of the foreign AE over transactions between it and its Indian counterpart ; and if the answer is in affirmative, then by unloading the effect of such influence on the transaction. This entire exercise is executed by firstly visualizing the value of an international transaction between the two AEs; then ascertaining the ALP of such transaction; and then eventually computing the total income of the Indian AE having regard to the ALP of the international transaction.

In fact, the bright line test in our case is a way of finding out the cost/value of international transaction, which is the first variable under the TP provisions and not the second variable, being the ALP of the international transaction. Bright line is a line drawn within the overall amount of AMP expense. The amount on one side of the bright line is the amount of AMP expense incurred for normal business of the assessee and the remaining amount on the other side is the cost/value of the international transaction representing the amount of AMP expense incurred for and on behalf of the foreign AE towards creating or maintaining its marketing intangible. Now the pertinent question is where to draw such line. If the assessee fails to give any basis for drawing this line by not supplying the cost/value of the international transaction, and further by not showing any other more cogent way of determining the cost/value of such international transaction, then the onus comes upon the TPO to find out the cost/value of such international transaction in some rational manner.",

The excess of total AMP expenses over such amount as determined as per the immediately preceding step ought to have been and has been rightly taken as a measure to determine the amount of AMP expenses incurred by the assessee for the brand promotion of foreign AE.

Some of the common business models used have been elucidated as under:- (i)  Execute licensing agreements with independent parties for manufacturing the product having brands owned by the MNCs. Since these products have established brands, MNCs charge franchise fees or royalty for use of brands and technology developed by them. Prominent examples of this model are Domino‘s Pizza being sold by independent party Jubilant Food Works Ltd. or undergarments of Jockey brand sole by Page Industries Ltd.  (ii)  Establish a subsidiary for carrying out the distribution function. Examples of this include various appellants before this court.  (iii)  Establish a subsidiary for carrying out the distribution and manufacturing function. Maruti Suzuki Ltd. one of the appellants is an example of this business mode.  (iv)  Establish a subsidiary for manufacturing the product and use independent companies for distribution. Pepsi Foods Ltd. is an example of this type. It manufactures concentrate which is then sold to bottlers. Some of the bottlers are associated enterprises (AEs) of Pepsi group but some others are independent parties.  (v)  Establishment of a subsidiary for carrying out only marketing support services (customers are identified by these subsidiaries and orders are negotiated by the foreign MNC and sales are directly made by foreign MNCs to Indian customers). In these models, the foreign companies invariably  remunerate the Indian subsidiary with the cost together with some additional fee for such market support activities.‖",

Performance of this function clearly benefits the brands and market intangibles owned by the parent company. The test to determine whether the Indian subsidiary was/is incurring the AMP expenses for itself or at the instance of the AE was/is to find out whether an independent party would have undertaken the same level of AMP expenses. An independent party with short-term agreement with an MNE would not incur costs which give long-term benefits of brand and market development advantage to another entity. It is fallacious to contend that brand promotion would benefit an independent entity, for increase in volume of sales largely benefits the manufacturer both in terms of the profit with increased sales and enhanced value to the brand. Benefit to the Indian entity is only marginal or incidental. The contention is that the action of the independent subsidiary amounts to rendering of service to the foreign AE for which arm‘s length compensation was/is payable.

Routine or day-to-day marketing or sale promotion expenses even, when excessive and exorbitant, would not amount per se to ―brand building‖ expenses. The Revenue in the written submissions in fact have accepted in paragraph 8.8 that promotion of products go hand in hand and at most of the times brand is distinguishable from products as only by display of products in a particular manner or emphasis on a particular feature of the  product, the consumer is given the message of what to expect from a given ―brand‖ (sic, product). Hence, it is difficult to compartmentalise promotion of product or promotion of brand expenses and record them as separate from each other. The aforesaid assertions reflect the thin edge and the difficult path Revenue has adopted in bifurcating AMP expenses into marketing or sale promotions and ―brand building‖ by creating and adopting the ―bright line test‖. We have elaborately discussed the concept of term ―brand‖ and ―brand building‖ and observe that it would be incorrect to treat advertisement as equivalent or synonymous with ―brand building‖ for the latter in commercial sense refers to several facets and components. The primary being the quality and reputation of the product or name, which is acquired gradually and silently over a passage of time. The aforesaid arguments fails to notice the fundamental principle of international taxation and Chapter X of the Act that the foreign AE and the Indian AE are two separate tax centres and taxable entities. Profits or enhanced profits consequent to higher manufacturing turnover would be taxed in the hands of the foreign AE, whereas higher profits as a result of increased turnover relatable to distribution and marketing functions would be taxed in the hands of the Indian subsidiary, i.e. the AE. The position would be different if the foreign AE has Permanent Establishment in India. The Revenue has generalised and the argument adopts a universal and ubiquitous approach in the contention that increased turnover would not benefit the Indian AE. The argument is sceptical and conjectural. Moreover, transfer pricing can always correct profit shifting, albeit, by reducing/increasing price/consideration payable to the Indian AE.",

The arm‘s length price in case of a pure distribution company would enure lower price/profit as compared to a company engaged in distribution and marketing. In most of the cases, distribution and marketing operations would go hand in hand. Marketing itself is a term of wide import and connotation, which includes development of marketing strategy which may have certain common worldwide elements and would normally be the creation and premised by the parent foreign AE but the Indian assessee engaged in marketing operations could devise its own marketing strategies, determine as to the nature and type of advertisements, media selection, timings, etc. Even the choice of products could depend upon local/national conditions. While determining the arm‘s length price, the issue would be whether or not the Indian assessee is adequately compensated by the foreign AE. The Indian assessee also benefits from the increased sales which results in higher profits and more taxable income in India. AMP, i.e.  advertisements, marketing and sale promotions, therefore, benefit both the Indian AE, i.e. the assessee and the foreign AE resident abroad. Same is true and correct position even in case of a distribution company, though in the said case sales would increase and there would not be any element of AMP. The fact that increased sales benefit the foreign manufacturer is the reason why services of Indian assessees have been engaged by the AEs resident abroad. This argument itself does not show that brand building is being independently undertaken and, therefore, should be treated as a separate international transaction. However, the arm‘s length computation made both by the assessee as well as the TPO must take into account the AMP expenses.",

Any excess expenditure beyond the bright line should be regarded as a separate international transaction of brand building. Such a broad-brush universal approach is unwarranted and would amount to judicial legislation. During the course of arguments, it was accepted by the Revenue that the TPOs/Assessing Officers have universally applied ‗bright line test‘ to decipher and compute value of international transaction and thereafter applied ‗Cost Plus Method‘ or ‗Cost Method‘ to compute the arm‘s length price. The said approach is not mandated and stipulated in the Act or the Rules. The list of parameters for ascertaining the comparables for applying bright line test in paragraph 17.4 and, thereafter, the assertion in paragraph 17.6 that comparison can be only made by choosing comparable of domestic cases not using any foreign brand, is contrary to the Rules. It amounts to writing and prescribing a mandatory procedure or test which is not stipulated in the Act or  the Rules. This is beyond what the statute in Chapter X postulates. Rules also do not so stipulate. The argument and reasoning in paragraph 17.6 in a way loses focus on the main issue and controversy; whether the arm‘s length price fixed between the two AEs is adequate and justified and would have been paid if the transaction was between two independent enterprises. The two independent enterprises must be two unrelated parties having no connection. It does not matter whether the comparables are domestic enterprises or not.

                        "content": "During the course of hearing before us, counsel for the Revenue had submitted that paragraph 17.4 should be treated as illustrations and not as binding comparables. We would prefer to observe, that an Assessing Officer/ TPO can go and must examine the question whether the assessee is performing functions of a pure distributor or performing distribution and marketing functions, in the latter case, he must examine and ascertain whether the transfer price takes into consideration the marketing function, which would include AMP functions. This would ensure adequate transaction price and hence assure no loss of revenue. When the distribution and marketing functions are interconnected and reliable comparables are available, arm‘s length price could be computed as a package, if required and necessary by making adequate adjustments. When the Assessing Officer/TPO comes to the conclusion that it is not possible to compute arm‘s length price without segregating and dividing distribution and marketing or AMP functions, he can so proceed after giving justification and adequate reasons. At that stage, he would have apportioned the price received or the compensation paid by the foreign AE towards distribution and marketing or AMP functions. The TPO can then apply an appropriate method and compute the arm‘s length price of the two independently and even  by applying separate methods. This will be in terms of the provisions of the Act and the Rules and also as per the general principles of international taxation accepted and applied universally. On the other hand, as recorded by us above, applying ‗bright line test‘ on the basis of parameters prescribed in paragraphs 17.4 and 17.6 would be adding and writing words in the statute and the Rules and introducing a new concept which has not been recognised and accepted in any of the international commentaries or as per the general principles of international taxation accepted and applied universally. There is nothing in the Act or the Rules to hold that it is obligatory that the AMP expenses must and necessarily should be subjected to ‗bright line test‘ and the non-routine AMP expenses as a separate transaction to be computed in the manner as stipulated.",

These are specific regulations framed and applicable in the United States. Care and caution has to be used when we make reference or apply these regulations or interpretation placed by the IRS, in United States of America. 1.482-4 of 2009 Regulations, relating to methods to determine taxable income in connection with transfer of intangible property, elucidates that arm‘s length consideration for contribution by one controlled taxpayers that develops or enhances the value or may be reasonably anticipated to develop or enhance the value of an intangible property of the other AE, would depend upon several circumstances. If the consideration for such contribution is embedded within the contractual term for the controlled transaction, then ordinarily no separate allocation will be made for such contribution. Thereafter, examples have been given. It stands recorded that the comparability analysis would include  consideration of all relevant factors, including compensation for the activities performed by the subsidiary and that it is provided in the transfer price, rather than provided by a separate agreement. Reference is also made to requirement to pay royalty and the effect thereof. In 1.482-6, in the context of Profit Split Method, it is recorded that allocation of income to controlled taxpayers, routine contribution will not reflect profit attributable to each controlled taxpayers contribution, but non-routine contribution is not to be accounted for as routine contribution. A non-routine contribution of intangible property may be measured by external benchmarks that reflect the fair market value of such intangible property, or in alternative the relative value of non-routine property contributions may be estimated by capital cost of differentiating the intangible property and all related improvements updates, less an appropriate amount of amortisation based on the useful life of each intangible property. In the present case, none of the parties had applied Profit Split Method and, therefore, the observations in paragraph 1.482-6 would not be of much relevance. Section 1.482-4, however, does state that development or enhancement of intangible property owned by another controlled taxpayer should be accounted for in evaluating the availability of the controlled transaction with comparable transactions. We have quoted the Indian position on the subject under the heading ―Brand and brand building‖. We are not examining and evaluating Profit Split Method.

On question of identifying the most suitable method, it is observed that the most appropriate and relevant method should have regard to all factors including respective strength and weaknesses of possible methods in their application to actual conditions, the  circumstances including functions performed, assets used and risk borne by the entities, availability of reliable information required to apply a particular method and degree of comparability between actual circumstances and comparable circumstances, including reliability of adjustments to eliminate the effect of material differences. In identifying comparable circumstances, functions, assets and risk analysis, characteristics of property or services transferred, terms of the relevant contract, economic circumstances and the business strategies of the entities assume importance. Circumstances are comparable to actual circumstances, if and to the extent that the circumstances differ from actual circumstances, when the said difference does not materially affect a condition that is relevant to the method or reasonably adequate adjustment can be made to eliminate the effect of the difference on the condition that is relevant to the method. Illustrations, six in number, draw distinction between long-term distribution or distribution-cum-marketing agreements and short-term contractual arrangements. The resident AEs must be compensated by the foreign AE for the services provided; whether it be in the nature of pure distribution or promotional services; or services as a marketer which also undertakes advertisement and sale promotion expenses resulting in return attributable to marketing intangibles. A long-term pure distributor, who bears no cost or risk of development and market, would not be entitled to any return on the marketing intangibles. Same would be the position in a short-term contract. In case of a long-term contract where marketing expenditures are not abnormal and the resident AE has been proportionately compensated for marketing activities, no separate addition towards compensation is warranted. In cases of long-term contract of exclusive and market distribution rights for a trademark product, where market development activities and extraordinary marketing expenditures are in excess of what comparable independent enterprise with similar rights would incur, adjustment may be required,  provided such compensation has not been paid. Reference was made to paragraph 6.38 of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which stipulate that the said AE might obtain an additional return from the owner of the trademark perhaps through a lower purchase price of the product or reduction in royalty rate. It could also be direct compensation. For distinguishing short-term and long-term contracts, reference has been made to paragraph 3.74 and 2.130 of the 2010 OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, to observe that this has to be determined ordinarily based on the conditions existing at the start of the arrangement and, therefore, the consequent effect that a contract is or is not renewed, ordinarily would not be a factor in its initial pricing. This may be otherwise, if there is evidence at the start of the arrangement to indicate that the contract would be renewed. Therefore, in cases of short-term contract, adjustment would be justified, if there is no direct compensation; marketing expenditure incurred is not included in the profit element by reduction of price or royalty payable. This would be accounted for while taking into account the available data about profits of comparable independent enterprises during the corresponding years of similar short-term marketing and distribution agreements.  The examples also deal with re-negotiation.",

An independent distributor with a full marketing right is a person or an entity legally independent of the manufacturer, who purchases goods from the manufacturer for re-sale on its own accounts. The transaction between the two is a straightforward sale in which the distributor takes all economic risk of product distribution and ultimately gains or makes loss depending upon market and other conditions. The manufacturer is not concerned. In case of a low or no risk distributor and he virtually acts as an agent for the loss and gain is that of the manufacturer. There is no economic  risk on distribution of profits. He is, therefore, entitled to fixed remuneration for the self efforts, i.e., relating to the task or function of distribution. Similar will be the position of a low risk distributor with marketing functions, except that the said distributor should be compensated for the marketing, including AMP function. A distributor with marketing function can be normal or a high risk distributor. Such distributors should be compensated but the quantum of compensation would be higher. Such cases have to be distinguished from cases of a true distributor, who is in an independent business, uses his own money for purchasing at a low price and selling at a high price and accordingly shoulders the burden in case of a bad judgment. Profits or losses, therefore, correspond to the risk and market consideration. There is also functional incompatibility between a distributor and a retailer. Retailers cannot be compared with distributor also performing marketing functions. Foreign global enterprises frequently adopt a subsidiary model, i.e. the products are distributed and marketed in a targeted country through a wholly owned subsidiary or a sales subsidiary. A comparable would be an unrelated identity with similar distribution and marketing functions.",

This mandates identification of the nature, types and stages of development of marketing intangibles, i.e. whether the foreign parties are new entrants into the Indian market and, therefore, related party in India would incur substantial expenses. Awareness of the trade mark or brand profit or services of the parent company in India, customer loyalty and the brand existence of dealer network whether the Indian entity is to provide after sales service the support, market and customer details, etc. It acknowledged that the stand of the Indian tax authorities, who have applied the concept of ‗bright line test‘ of no risk or limited risk distributor or to determine non-routine expenses, has led to multifarious challenges on several account. However, it stands recorded in subparagraph No.18 that the important issue in determination of arm‘s length price is to examine the benefits of the AMP expenditure and whether Indian entities do not receive share of excess profits related to local marketing intangible. Accordingly, the claim of the Revenue is that extraordinary AMP expenditure does not result in appropriate enhancement of profitability of Indian subsidiary or related party. The question, therefore, when a subsidiary entity engaged in distribution and marketing incurs AMP expenses, is to ascertain whether the subsidiary AE entity has been adequately and properly compensated for undertaking the said expenditure. Such compensation may be in the form of lower purchase price, non or reduced payment of royalty or by way of direct payments to ensure adequate profit margin. This ensures proper payment of taxes and curtails avoidance or lower taxes of the Indian subsidiary as a separate juristic entity.",

In 1994, Glaxo and IRS tried to resolve the dispute through advance pricing agreement, but were unsuccessful. The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between U.K. and U.S. was invoked. The dispute, it appears was predicated on IRS‘s assertion that advertisement and marketing was more valuable in respect of the said drug, whereas Glaxo and the U.K. taxing authority believed that the high transfer price was reasonable because the research and development work was more valuable. In December, 2000, Glaxo merged with SmithKline Beecham  Corporation. As noted above, SmithKline Beecham had earlier entered into an advance tax agreement with the IRS in respect of the same drug. The terms of the said advance pricing agreement were made public. In 2004, the litigation took another turn, when GlaxoSmithKline sued IRS claiming that they had erred in increasing the assessed income and sought refund along with interest. The matter was scheduled for trial, when on 11th September, 2006, IRS and GlaxoSmithKline announced settlement.

In such a case, it is necessary to determine how the marketer should be compensated for those activities. The issue is whether the marketer should be compensated as a service provider, i.e., for providing promotional services, or whether there are any cases in which the marketer should share in any additional return attributable to the marketing intangibles.

In general, in arm‘s length transactions the ability of a party that is not the legal owner of a marketing intangible to obtain the future benefits of marketing activities that increase the value of that intangible will depend principally on the substance of the rights of that party. For example, a distributor may have the ability to obtain benefits from its investments in developing the value of a trademark from its turnover and market share where it has a long-term contract of sole distribution rights for the trademarked product. In such cases, the distributor‘s share of benefits should be determined based on what an independent distributor would obtain in comparable circumstances. In some cases, a distributor may bear extraordinary marketing expenditures beyond what an independent distributor with similar rights might incur for the benefit of its own distribution activities. An independent distributor in such a case might obtain an additional return from the owner of the trademark, perhaps through a decrease in the purchase price of the product or a reduction in royalty rate.",

A marketing intangible may obtain value as a consequence of advertising and other promotional expenditures, which can be important to maintain the value of the trademark. However, it can be difficult to determine what these expenditures have contributed to the success of a product. For instance, it can be difficult to determine what advertising and marketing expenditures have contributed to the production or revenue, and to what degree. It is also possible that a new trademark or one newly introduced into a particular market may have no value or little value in that market and its value may change over the years as it makes an impression on the market (or perhaps loses its impact). A dominant market share may to some extent be attributable to marketing efforts of a distributor. The value and any changes will depend to an extent on how effectively the trademark is promoted in the particular market. More fundamentally, in many cases higher returns derived from the sale of trademarked products may be due as much to the unique characteristics of the product or its high quality as to the success of advertising and other promotional expenditures. The actual conduct of the parties over a period of years should be given significant weight in evaluating the return attributable to marketing activities.

Attorney-General: As I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however, great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be.\"",

The intention on the other hand of the Legislature is not what is propounded by the Revenue. Consistent, the stand  of the Revenue, it is apparent is divergent from the internationally accepted practice relating to Transfer Pricing determinations. The Legislature when it wanted to deviate, has adopted such recourse as with the year data and use of inter-quartile range. We do not read any repugnancy on this aspect in Section 92(3) of the Act. Thus, where the Act, i.e. the Income Tax Act, 1961 or the Rules do not devise or enact a contrary provision, we should not discard or ignore, without adequate justification, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines or the U.N. Transfer Pricing Manual. Otherwise we deny ourselves benefit and advantage of the study and the dexterous and deliberated elucidations made in the extant OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines or the U.N. Transfer Pricing Manual, as if they are redundant and superfluous. The Act, i.e. the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Rules are supreme, but the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines or the U.N.

In the light of such glaring facts, the suggestion that the existence of an international transaction is being inferred by the revenue by applying some mathematical tool is not correct.‖  It should not be understood that we are holding or pronouncing our verdict on the basis of the said written submissions but we have quoted the aforesaid portion to show that the Revenue is conscience and aware of commercial business realities and the need to account for set offs.

It would not arise for consideration in cases where there are closely linked or continuous international transactions. Yet, there may be a third category of cases, where the assessee perceives and files his report in form 92E treating the international transaction as one or as continuous or an interconnected package, but the Revenue perceives and believes that the transaction is not one, but should be segregated for the purpose of computation of arm‘s length price. For the present reasoning, we will assume and accept that the position of the Revenue is correct and the ‗aggregation‘ made by the assessee is wrong. In such cases, it would be grossly unfair and inequitable not to apportion or segregate the transactions as declared in a reasonable and logical manner. It would be conspicuously wrong and incorrect to treat the segregated transactional value as ‗NIL‘ when in fact the two AEs had treated the international transactions as a package or a single one and contribution is attributed to the aggregate package. It is noticeable that subsection (3) to Section 92 does not make reference to the computation of the form 92E but makes reference to the books of account and computation on the basis of the entries in the books of account. It stipulates that the computation made under sub-section (2) or (2A) shall not have effect of reducing the income or increasing the losses as declared on the basis of the said entries.

Normally, tax authorities cannot disregard the actual transaction or substitute the same for another transaction as per their perception. Restructuring of legitimate business transaction would be an arbitrary exercise. This legal position stands affirmed in EKL Appliances Ltd. (supra). The decision accepts two exceptions to the said rule. The first being where the economic substance of the transaction differs from its form. In such cases, the tax authorities may disregard the parties‘ characterisation of the transaction and re-characterise the same in accordance with its substance. The Tribunal has not invoked the said exception, but the second exception, i.e. when the form and substance of the transaction are the same, but the arrangements made in relation to the transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by the independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. The second exception also mandates that actual structure should practically impede the tax authorities from determining an appropriate transfer price. The majority judgment does not record the second condition and holds that in their considered opinion, the second exception governs the instant situation as per which, the form and substance of the transaction were the same but the arrangements made in relation to a transaction, when viewed in their totality, differ from those which would have been adopted by an independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. The aforesaid observations were recorded in the light of the fact in the case of L.G. Electronics (supra). Commenting on the factual matrix of L.G. Electronics case (supra) would be beyond our domain; however, we do not find any factual finding to this effect by the TPO or the Tribunal in any of the present cases. However, in L.G.  Electronics decision (supra), it is observed that if the AMP expenses and when such expenses are beyond the bright line, the transaction viewed in their totality would differ from one which would have been adopted by an independent enterprise behaving in a commercially rational manner. No reason or ground for holding or the ratio, is indicated or stated. There is no material or justification to hold that no independent party would incur the AMP expenses beyond the bright line AMP expenses. Free market conditions would indicate and suggest that an independent third party would be willing to incur heavy and substantial AMP expenses, if he presumes this is beneficial, and he is adequately compensated. The compensation or the rate of return would depend upon whether it is a case of long-term or short-term association and market conditions, turnover and ironically international or worldwide brand value of the intangibles by the third party.",

Directions were issued. At the same time, an order of remand to the TPO to compute the arm‘s  length price on the basis of said principles was passed. It would not be correct to hold that the Supreme Court had accepted and had given seal of approval and not interfered with the principles/ratio enunciated in the judgment by the Delhi High Court. The Supreme Court as is lucid did not want to examine the principles or ratio as enunciated and express their opinion on merits, though the directions issued by the High Court, it was observed, ―conclude the matter‖. The Supreme Court perceived and accepted that the ‗issue‘ of arm‘s length price should be re-examined by the TPO without being curtailed or restrained by the legal principles/ratio delineated. As the Supreme Court itself was not examining the principles/ratio on merits, it did not pass any order in favour or against the assessee or the Revenue. Accordingly, the aforesaid observations. The effect thereof was that the judgment of the Delhi High Court would not operate as res judicata between the parties and merits, if required, would be examined and gone into in the appellate proceedings. The majority judgment has incorrectly inferred that the legal principles and directions issued by the Delhi High Court would continue to be binding decidendi and had attained finality, viz. the tax authorities and the Tribunal. It is not so indicated. If the legal principles/ratio was not binding on the writ petitioner, i.e. the assessed in the said case, it would be malapropos and inappropriate to treat the directions as binding ratio, in respect of third parties.

Uncontrolled transaction is comparable with the controlled transaction for the purpose of RP Method, only if two conditions are satisfied: that there is no difference between the functions, which would materially affect the normal gross profit margins in the open market; and reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate material effect of such differences. RP  Method may require fewer adjustments on account of product differences in comparison to the CUP Method, i.e. Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method because minor product differences are less likely to have material effect on the profit margins as they do on the price. Compensation for performing similar functions tends to equalise across different activities, whereas in case of products, the equalisation is normally possible to the extent that products are substitute for each other. Nevertheless, similarity of the property as transferred in the controlled transaction for closer comparability of products/services would produce more accurate results. Sometimes, RP Method is adopted as more accurate or best method where controlled and uncontrolled transactions are comparable in all characteristic, other than the product itself. In some cases, it may be a preferable and more reliable method in comparison to the CUP Method or CP Method. However, RP Method has its weaknesses. It loses its accuracy and reliability where the reseller adds substantially to the value of the product or the goods are further processed or incorporated into a more sophisticated product or when the product/service is transformed. In the OECD Commentary on Transfer Pricing Guidelines it has been observed:  ― … Another example where the resale price margin requires particular care is where the reseller contributes substantially to the creation or maintenance of intangible property associated with the product (e.g. trademarks or trade names) which are owned by an associated enterprise. In such cases, the contribution of the goods originally transferred to the value of the final product cannot be easily evaluated.",

This level of activities can range widely from the case where the reseller performs only minimal services as a forwarding agent to the case where the reseller takes on the full risk of ownership together with the full responsibility for and the risks involved in advertising, marketing, distributing and guaranteeing the goods, financing stocks, and other connected services. If the reseller in the controlled transaction does not carry on a substantial commercial activity, but only transfers the goods to a third party, the  resale price margin could, in light of the functions performed, be a small one. The resale price margin could be higher where it can be demonstrated that the reseller has some special expertise in the marketing of such goods, in effect bears special risks, or contributes substantially to the creation or maintenance of intangible property associated with the product. However, the level of activity performed by the reseller, whether minimal or substantial, would need to be well supported by relevant evidence. This would include justification for marketing expenditures that might be considered unreasonably high; for example, when part or most of the promotional expenditure was clearly incurred as a service performed in favour of the legal owner of the trademark. In such\\a case the Cost Plus method may well supplement the RP Method.‖",

As compared to CUP Method, RP Method requires less direct transactional (product) comparability than CUP Method. However, there must be functional comparability. A similar level of compensation is expected for performing similar functions across different activities. This uniformity and similitude is necessary because similar gross profits are being compared. If there are material differences that reflect in the gross profit margins between the controlled and uncontrolled transaction, adjustments should be possible on account of such differences. Functions performed can be simple and cover a limited field of sales, general or administrative expenses; to more complex one, adding substantially to the gross profit margins. The latter may happen if the reseller adds substantially to the value of the product by assisting considerably in creation and maintenance of intangible products or where the goods are further processed into a more valuable or complicated product. Referring to the weaknesses of the said method, the commentary states:- ―The method can be used without forcing distributors to inappropriately ―make profits‖. The distributor earns an arm‘s length gross profit margin, however, but could have operating losses due, for example, to high selling expenses caused by business strategies such as a market penetration strategy. By comparison, the application of the Transactional Net Margin Method, which analyses a financial ratio based on operating profits, will generally result in an arm‘s length range of positive operating profits. The tested party in the analysis would then probably also earn a positive operating profit within the range. However, the Resale Price Method does not necessarily result in positive operating profits to be earned by the tested party.  xxx",

Discount and incentives offered, reduce the operating profits and, therefore, the benchmarking exercise with comparables, reflects and accounts for the same. We have examined the impact and consequences of applying CP Method, by factoring and treating AMP expenses and trade discounts and incentives as an independent international transaction, when we continue to treat the said expenses as a component of a packaged international transaction, which is separately benchmarked. This would not lead us to accurate and reliable results. There is need and requirement to check over or double taxation.",

Whether the additions suggested by the Transfer Pricing Officer on account of Advertising/Marketing and Promotion Expenses (‗AMP Expenses‘ for short) was beyond jurisdiction and bad in law as no specific reference was made by the Assessing Officer, having regard to retrospective amendment to Section 92CA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by Finance Act, 2012.‖  In terms of and subject to discussion under the heading C, paragraph Nos.41 to 50, the substantial question of law No.1 is answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.  ―Q.2. Whether AMP Expenses incurred by the assessee in India can be treated and categorized as an international transaction under Section 92B of the Income Tax Act, 1961.‖  In terms of and subject to discussion under the heading C, paragraph Nos.51 to 57, the substantial question of law No.2 is answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.  ―Q.3. Whether under Chapter X of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a transfer pricing adjustment can be made by the Transfer Pricing Officer/ Assessing Officer in respect of expenditure treated as AMP Expenses and if so in which circumstances?  Q.4. If answer to question Nos.2 and 3 is in favour of the Revenue, whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that transfer pricing adjustment in respect of AMP Expenses should be computed by applying Cost Plus Method.  Q.5. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in directing that fresh bench marking/comparability analysis should be undertaken by the Transfer Pricing Officer by applying the parameters specified in paragraph 17.4 of the order dated 23.01.2013 passed by the Special Bench in the case of LG Electronics India (P) Ltd.?.‖  In terms of and subject to discussion under the headings D to P, we hold that the legal ratio accepted and applied by the Tribunal relying upon the majority decision in L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd (supra) is erroneous and unacceptable. For reasons set out above, we have passed an order of remand to the Tribunal to examine and ascertain facts and apply the ratio enunciated in this decision.  For the purpose of clarity, we would like to enlist our findings:- (i)  In case of a distributor and marketing AE, the first step in transfer pricing is to ascertain and conduct detailed functional analysis, which would include AMP function/expenses.  (ii)  The second step mandates ascertainment of comparables or comparable analysis. This would have reference to the method  adopted which matches the functions and obligations performed by the tested party including AMP expenses.  (iii)  A comparable is acceptable, if based upon comparison of conditions a controlled transaction is similar with the conditions in the transactions between independent enterprises. In other words, the economically relevant characteristics of the two transactions being compared must be sufficiently comparable. This entails and implies that difference, if any, between controlled and uncontrolled transaction, should not materially affect the conditions being examined given the methodology being adopted for determining the price or the margin. When this is not possible, it should be ascertained whether reasonably accurate adjustments can be made to eliminate the effect of such differences on the price or margin. Thus, identification of the potential comparables is the key to the transfer pricing analysis. As a sequitur, it follows that the choice of the most appropriate method would be dependent upon availability of potential comparable keeping in mind the comparability analysis including befitting adjustments which may be required. As the degree of the comparability increases, extent of potential differences which would render the analysis inaccurate necessarily decreases.  (iv)  The assessed, i.e. the domestic AE must be compensated for the AMP expenses by the foreign AE. Such compensation may be included or subsumed in low purchase price or by not charging or charging lower royalty. Direct compensation can also be paid. The method selected and comparability analysis should be appropriated and reliable so as to include the AMP functions and costs.  (v)  Where the Assessing Officer/TPO accepts the comparables adopted by the assessed, with or without making adjustments, as a bundled transaction, it would be illogical and improper to treat AMP expenses as a separate international transaction, for the simple reason that if the functions performed by the tested parties and the comparables match, with or without adjustments, AMP expenses are duly accounted for. It would be incongruous to accept the comparables and determine or accept the transfer price and still segregate AMP expenses as an international transaction.  (vi)  The Assessing Officer/TPO can reject a method selected by the assessed for several reasons including want of reliability in the factual matrix or lack / non-availability of comparables. (see Section 92C(3) of the Act).  (vii)  When the Assessing Officer/TPO rejects the method adopted by the assessed, he is entitled to select the most appropriate method, and undertake comparability analysis. Selection of the method and comparables should be as per the command and directive of the Act and Rules and justified by giving reasons.  (viii)  Distribution and marketing are inter-connected and intertwined functions. Bunching of inter-connected and continuous transactions is permissible, provided the said transactions can be evaluated and adequately compared on aggregate basis. This would depend on the method adopted and comparability analysis and the most reliable means of determining arm‘s length price.  (ix)  To assert and profess that brand building as equivalent or substantial attribute of advertisement and sale promotion would be largely  incorrect. It represents a coordinated synergetic impact created by assortment largely representing reputation and quality. ―Brand‖ has reference to a name, trademark or trade name and like ‗goodwill‘ is a value of attraction to customers arising from name and a reputation for skill, integrity, efficient business management or efficient service. Brand creation and value, therefore, depends upon a great number of facts relevant for a particular business. It reflects the reputation which the proprietor of the brand has gathered over a passage or period of time in the form of widespread popularity and universal approval and acceptance in the eyes of the customer. Brand value depends upon the nature and quality of goods and services sold or dealt with. Quality control being the most important element, which can mar or enhance the value.  (x)  Parameters specified in paragraph 17.4 of the order dated 23rd January, 2013 in the case of L.G. Electronics India Pvt Ltd (supra) are not binding on the assessed or the Revenue. The ‗bright line test‘ has no statutory mandate and a broad-brush approach is not mandated or prescribed. We disagree with the Revenue and do not accept the overbearing and orotund submission that the exercise to separate ‗routine‘ and ‗non-routine‘ AMP or brand building exercise by applying ‗bright line test‘ of non-comparables should be sanctioned and in all cases, costs or compensation paid for AMP expenses would be ‗NIL‘, or at best would mean the amount or compensation expressly paid for AMP expenses. It would be conspicuously wrong and incorrect to treat the segregated transactional value as ‗NIL‘ when in fact the two AEs had treated the international transactions as a package or a single one and contribution is attributed to the aggregate  package. Unhesitatingly, we add that in a specific case this criteria and even zero attribution could be possible, but facts should so reveal and require. To this extent, we would disagree with the majority decision in L.G. Electronics India Pvt. Ltd. (supra). This would be necessary when the arm‘s length price of the controlled transaction cannot be adequately or reliably determined without segmentation of AMP expenses.  (xi)  The Assessing Officer/TPO for good and sufficient reasons can de-bundle interconnected transactions, i.e. segregate distribution, marketing or AMP transactions. This may be necessary when bundled transactions cannot be adequately compared on aggregate basis.  (xii)  When segmentation or segregation of a bundled transaction is required, the question of set off and apportionment must be examined realistically and with a pragmatic approach. Transfer pricing is an income allocating exercise to prevent artificial shifting of net incomes of controlled taxpayers and to place them on parity with uncontrolled, unrelated taxpayers. The exercise undertaken should not result in over or double taxation. Thus, the Assessing Officer/TPO can segregate AMP expenses as an independent international transaction, but only after elucidating grounds and reasons for not accepting the bunching adopted by the assessed, and examining and giving benefit of set off. Section 92(3) does not bar or prohibit set off.  (xiii)  CP Method is a recognised and accepted method under Indian transfer pricing regulation. It can be applied by the Assessing Officer/TPO in case AMP expenses are treated as a separate international transaction, provided CP Method is the most appropriate and reliable method.  Adoption of CP Method and computation of cost and gross profit margin comparable must be justified.  (xiv)  The object and purpose of Transfer Pricing adjustment is to ensure that the controlled taxpayers are given tax parity with uncontrolled taxpayers by determining their true taxable income. Costs or expenses incurred for services provided or in respect of property transferred, when made subject matter of arm‘s length price by applying CP Method, cannot be again factored or included as a part of interconnected international transaction and subjected to arm‘s length pricing.",
