For the said purpose knowledge about various clients with whom defendant No.1 would have dealt with as a Director of the plaintiff No.2, details of hotels, restaurants etc. with whom he would have to deal while carrying on his business cannot be a subject matter of injunction. Even otherwise, in the travel trade, names of hotels, restaurants, shopping complex etc. would be something which would be available in public domain.

The aforesaid DTAA was notified on 13th September, 1960. Article VIIIA was inserted subsequently after protocol was signed on 28th June, 1984 and ratified on 10th July, 1985. As the said article arises for consideration, we deem it appropriate to reproduce the entire Article:- “ ARTICLE VIIIA  (1) Royalties and fees for technical services arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.   (2) However, such royalties and fees for technical services may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State. But insofar as the fees for technical services are concerned, the tax so charged shall not exceed 20 per cent of the gross amount of such fees.   (3)  The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films of films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.   (4)  The term “fees for technical services” as used in this Article means payments of any kind to any person, other than payments to an employee of the person making the payments, in consideration for services of a managerial, technical or consultancy nature, including the provision of services of technical or other personnel.   (5)  The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties or fees for technical services, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties or fees for technical services arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the right, property or contract in respect of which the royalties or fees or technical services are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article III shall apply.   (6)  Royalties and fees for technical services shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is that State itself, a land, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties or fees for technical services, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to make the payments was incurred and the payments are borne by that permanent establishment, then the royalties or fees for technical services shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   (7)  Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and some other person, the amount of the royalties or fees for technical services paid exceeds for whatever reason the amount which would have been paid in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the law of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.”",

                        "content": "Before we examine the relevant clauses of agreement dated 11th May, 1987 between HCL and ADC, it would be first appropriate to examine the ambit and scope of the term „royalty‟ taxable under Article VIIIA of the DTAA. The said article applies to „royalties‟ and „fee for technical services‟ arising in one contracting State and paid to the resident of the other contracting State. Royalties and fee for technical services can be taxed in the source State, i.e., the State from where the payment is made in accordance with the laws of the State, but the tax so charged cannot exceed 20% of the gross amount of such fee. Therefore, „royalty‟ or „fee for technical services‟ paid by HCL to ADC would be taxable in India as this is the State from where payments arose and knowhow was utilized, in accordance with the laws in India but the tax so charged cannot exceed 20% of the gross amount of such fee. To this extent also, the parties are ad idem and there is no dispute. The dispute is whether the payments made under the agreement dated 11th May, 1987 are „royalty‟ within the meaning of clause (3) of Article VIIIA of the DTAA. The term „royalty‟ has been defined in the said clause to mean payments of any kind received as a consideration for use of, or right to use any copyright of literary, artistic or  scientific work including cinematographic films or films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark ,design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience. The said Article is in consonance with the UN Model Tax Treaties rather than OECD Model. The use of the words “right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment” expands the ambit and scope of the term „royalty‟ in Article VIIIA. The term “royalties” in 1963 draft convention and the 1977 Model OECD Convention included payments “for use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment”, but reference to these payments was subsequently deleted. The term „royalty‟ as used in the Article refers to any kind of consideration for use of or right to use patent, design or model, secret formula or process or for non-concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience in addition to the use or right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment. The aforesaid definition is in consonance with the term „royalty‟ as popularly and commercially understood. It represents consideration received by a person, who is the owner of the intangible intellectual property rights or know-how for permitting a third person to use or the right to use the said rights or know-how. It is essentially payment for a user of intellectual property right or know-how, which may be lumpsum, annual or periodical payment. The term „royalty‟ is associated with the payment made for grant of the user right. Grant of user right has to be distinguished from transfer of ownership in intangible property or know-how, i.e., sale of intangible property or know-how by the proprietor to a third person. In the latter case, the consideration paid is not for use of or right to use the intangible property or know-how but to acquire full ownership. The consideration  paid for transfer of full ownership in the realm of international tax laws is normally taxed as per applicable DTAA either as capital gains or as business income. In the facts of the present case, in case we hold that the payments made by HCL to ADC were for transfer of full ownership in the know-how or intellectual properties, the same would not be taxable under Article VIIIA of DTAA, but would be taxable in the country of residence of ADC, i.e., Federal Republic of Germany, either as capital gains or as business income. However, if we hold that the payments by HCL to ADC were for mere right to use or to use intellectual property rights/know-how and not for transfer of full ownership, the said payment to ADC would be taxable in India as royalty.",

As noted in paragraphs 15 and 16 below as regards software, difficulties can arise in the case of a transfer of rights that could be considered to form part of an element of property referred to in the definition where these rights are transferred in a way that is presented as an alienation. For example, this could involve the exclusive granting of all rights to an intellectual property for a limited period or all rights to the property in a limited geographical area in a transaction structured as a sale. Each case will depend on its particular facts and will need to be examined in the light of the national intellectual property law applicable to the relevant type of property and the national law rules as regards what constitutes an alienation but in general, if the payment is in consideration for the alienation of rights that constitute distinct and specific property (which is more likely in the case of geographically-limited than time limited rights), such payments are likely to be business profits within Article 7 or a capital gain within Article 13 rather than royalties within Article 12. That follows from the fact that where the ownership of rights has been alienated, the consideration cannot be for the use of the rights. The essential character of the transaction as an alienation cannot be altered by the form of the consideration, the  payment of the consideration in instalments or, in the view of most countries, by the fact that the payments are related to a contingency.",

These payments being payments “of any kind received as a consideration for…… the right to use” the property “or for information”, fall under the definition of royalties.”  The said commentary subsequently elucidates:- “11. In classifying as royalties payments received as consideration for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, paragraph 2 is referring to the concept of “know-how”. Various specialist bodies and authors have formulated definitions of know-how. The words “payments …for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience” are used in the context of the transfer of certain information that has not been patented and does not generally fall within other categories of intellectual property rights. It generally corresponds to undivulged information of an industrial, commercial or scientific nature arising from previous experience, which has practical application in the operation of an enterprise and from the disclosure of which an economic benefit can be derived. Since the definition relates to information concerning previous experience, the Article does not apply to payments for new information obtained as a result of performing services at the request of the payer.",

The purchaser owns the physical book, may read the book and even reap intellectual benefits, but the purchaser acquires no right in the literary or intellectual information expressed in the book. Such instances can be multifarious. However, for adjudication of these appeals, we predicate our decision on the following test; where ownership of the rights is alienated and acquired by another party, the consideration is not for use of or right to use and, therefore, not royalty and vice versa.",

                        "content": "The aforesaid ratio is the legal position, which has been applied and accepted in several decisions in India. In Commissioner of Income Tax versus DCM Limited, (2011) 336 ITR 599 (Delhi), DTAA between India and United Kingdom was applicable. DCM Limited, the assessee, had entered into an agreement with one Tate and Lyle Industries Limited, London, which envisages payment of £ 15,500 in four instalments towards supply of documents, concerning what was known as Talo processes. The UK company, a pioneer in sugar technology, was in possession of knowhow for installation and operations of specialised equipment and processes and use of essential speciality chemical products, which assisted in elimination of limestone and hard coke, to greatly conserve energy and thus bring reduction in pollution and loss of sugar during manufacture. Article XIII (3) of the DTAA between India and United Kingdom defined the term „royalty‟ in somewhat different manner as it was based on the OECD Model, but this to our mind would not be entirely relevant and the distinguishing factor. The Delhi High Court rejected the appeal of the Revenue in the said case after referring to the various clauses of the agreement to hold that there was absolute or full transfer of technology and know-how, albeit on non-exclusive basis, which was confined to the factories of the assessee in India and with conditional right to sub-lease, as sub-licensing of technology or know-how required consent of the UK party. The exact reasoning given by the High Court in the said case reads:- “8.1 In our view, it is quite clear by virtue of the aforementioned agreement what the assessee obtained was a complete transfer of technology and know-how albeit on a non exclusive basis which was confined to its factories in India with a conditional right to sub-licence it to third parties. The sub-licencing of technology and/or know-how had to have, however, the consent of Tate and  also the approval of the Government of India. The obligation of Tate to update the technology and/or know-how transferred to assessee based on research and development carried out by it, had obviously to be restricted in point of time, bearing in mind that it was a transaction which dealt with complete transfer of technology. The time span provided was 5 years from the effective date of the contract.",

                        "content": "It was not, according to us, therefore, as contended by the learned counsel for the revenue, a mere use of the technology and/or know-how owned by Tate. Therefore, the mere fact that Tate retained with it the right to transfer technology and / or know-how to other parties did not in our view reduce the right obtained by the assessee under the agreement to one of a mere user of technology and knowhow. The transfer of technology is thus quite often, as in the present case, brought about by executing agreements which give rights far greater than a mere right to use albeit on a  non-exclusive basis. The argument made on behalf of the revenue that the transaction does not constitute a sale, misses the point that, for it to fall within the four corners of the provisions of Article XIII(3), the right conferred should be of usage; anything more than that, takes it out of ambit of definition of royalty as provided in the DTAA. We, therefore, agree with the conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal with regard to the terms of the agreement. Having come to this conclusion, it is quite obvious that the remittances made by the assessee to Tate would not fall in the definition of Article XIII(3) of the DTAA.”  The said decision distinguished decisions relied upon by the counsel for the Revenue, in the following words:- “11. In so far as the judgments cited by Mrs. Bansal are concerned, the same are distinguishable on facts. CIT Vs. J.K. Synthetics Ltd. (supra), turned on its own facts. Significantly it did not involve interpretation of the provisions of the DTAA as is the situation in the present case. Similarly, the Shri Ram case is also distinguishable. A reading of various clauses would show that there was no transfer of technology and know-how. In this regard, reference may be had to clause 11 of the agreement which specifically prohibited the right of the transferee to manufacture products based on the transferors technology after its determination. No such limitation exists in the present case. As a matter of fact, in the instant case, the termination clause provides for such an eventuality only on the grounds of insolvency of the parties. There is no general right of termination obtaining in the agreement in the present case.  Likewise, the judgment in the case of N.V. Philips Vs. CIT (1988) 172 ITR 521 is not applicable since what was transferred was use of technology. In this regard, specific reference may be made to clause (c) appearing at page 524 which provided that any information disclosed by the assessee to the Indian company under the agreement would remain confidential and would not become the property of the Indian company until such time and to the extent that such information had “become public” by application and user. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. (supra) would also not be applicable on a similar rationale.”  The decisions noted, were cases in which there was no absolute or full transfer of intellectual property rights or know-how, but only grant of right to use or permission to use intellectual property rights or know-how.",

The first portion of the agreement records that ADC and its licensors were engaged since 1980 in development, design, manufacture and sale and maintenance of computers used in engineering, scientific or technical applications and had acquired confidential and valuable proprietary rights in technical data and know-how relating to manufacture, testing and maintenance of such computers. HCL had desired to obtain technical data and know-how relating to licensed products described in Exhibit 3 (a paper/document not filed) and to manufacture, sale and maintain the said licensed products in India. ADC was to provide on mutually agreeable terms marketing, sales and technical support and to train HCL develop local system builders and software programmes and equipment i.e. the hardware. The term technology meant ADC‟s confidential and proprietary technical information, technical data, know-how, drawings, designs, processes, etc. Details of licensed products mentioned in Exhibit 3 are not available as the said exhibit has not been filed on record.",

                        "content": "Article 2 is important and has been misquoted in the impugned order by the Tribunal as also in the grounds of appeal. What was granted and  conveyed to HCL was non-exclusive right to manufacture, maintain, use and sell the licensed products in India in accordance with and pursuant to use of the technology. In the impugned order, clause 2.1 has been quoted as if an exclusive right was granted to the HCL, an assertion which is also made in the grounds of appeals. Albeit, it was accepted during the course of arguments that HCL was granted non-exclusive right by ADC and not an exclusive right. ADC had agreed to convey such technical data and know-how and grant to HCL non-exclusive right to manufacture, sell etc. the licenced products in India only pursuant to and for applying the technology. Clause 2.3 is important and stipulated that HCL could sub-licence or sub-contract in India in whole or in part production facilities of the licensed products under the technology and could disclose the said technology to the sub-licensee or sub-contractor, provided that such disclosure would not confer on the sub-licensee or the sub-contractors any right other than those granted to HCL and shall be subjected to restrictions and confidentiality provisions of Article 4. Clause 2.4 stipulated that subject to necessary approvals, ADC would also convey to HCL improvements, modification or inventions relating to the licensed products during the term of the agreement, which shall become a part of the technology. Thus the rights granted to HCL by ADC were restricted to specified and listed licensed property. Clause 2.6 stipulated that ADC had the absolute rights in its own discretion to discontinue and eliminate manufacture, use of, sale or otherwise stop business in respect of licensed products at any time during the term of the agreement. Notwithstanding, such dis-continuance/elimination, ADC would perform all obligations for a period of two years after the effective date of discontinuance. HCL could continue to manufacture, use and sell such eliminated licenced products, subject to HCL complying with provisions of the agreement. Article 3 dealt  with delivering of tangible technical information (2 copies) to be provided by ADC to HCL in English language. The technical information and technology was required to be accurate, comprehensive and up to date. In case of any inaccuracy, ADC at his own cost was required to rectify inaccuracy without delay, but was not liable for loss or damage caused to HCL due to such inaccuracies. This was subject to confidentiality provisions of Article 4. Further, tangible technical information relating to in Exhibit 3 (a document not filed) was required to be furnished to HCL from time to time during the term of the agreement without any additional lumpsum payment. Thus, upgradation of tangible technical information was stipulated. Clause 3.1.2 stipulated that a total three future versions of the licensed product, to be developed and manufacture by ADC in addition to the DN 3000 series as set forth in Exhibit 2, would be furnished. The products were not to be specifically developed for HCL.",

The proprietorship or ownership rights continued to vest with ADC, but right to use with trade name, technology etc. was granted by ADC to HCL. There was no transfer of the ownership in the intellectual property rights. In fact, the agreement stipulated that the HCL could protect the patents and intellectual property rights of ADC. The manufacturing and other  activities undertaken by HCL was subject to quality control and inspection by ADC. Clause 4.1 clearly stipulated that technical and other information was to remain ADC‟s proprietary. Information/knowhow was to remain confidential during the term of the agreement and even after expiry or termination thereof, until the same entered public domain or was otherwise generally known. HCL could not have breached the said confidentiality clause. A material breach by HCL would have resulted in an earlier termination of the agreement and reversion of all rights granted to HCL. It entailed ceasure of right to manufacture, use or sell the licensed products. Tangible technical information was to be returned. The agreement permitted HCL to disclose the said confidential intellectual property rights to the sub-contractors or sub-licensees only to the extent required for proper and authorised use of technology. Clause 2.3 was similarly worded and stated that HCL might sub-licence or sub-contract in whole or in part production of the licensed products and might disclose the technology provided that such disclosure would not confer upon the sub-contractor or the sub-licencee any rights other than those accorded to HCL. In case HCL was conferred full or absolute ownership in the intellectual property rights or in know-how, then it should follow as a sequitur that HCL was competent to transfer or convey to the sub-contractors and sub-licencees intellectual property rights. Clause 2.3 specifically refers to the confidentiality clause in article 4 and the binding effect. The clause relating to further technology or information in addition to technology already transferred is illustrative that it was not a case of complete or full transfer, but only a case of right to use or permission to use the technology by HCL. Thus, the provision for upgradation. The stipulation also reflects acceptance and recognition that the technology in the said field was transient and transitory and not lasting. Developments and improvements  were rapid, widespread and vigorous. Constant upgradation and improvements were eminent and rule of business.",

Ownership, therefore, is a bundle of rights, which a person who has title over the property, enjoys and commands. Holland, T.E. in Element of Jurisprudence observed that rights of ownership, conventionally could be arranged under three heads i.e. possession, enjoyment and dispossession. Right of dispossession carries with it right of alienation or destruction. Alienation may be either total when the ownership itself is transferred; or may be partial when a fraction of the rights, is granted or permitted. In cases of immoveable properties, the owner can grant right to use in the form of lease to a third person without transferring the ownership. Similarly, in cases of moveable properties, the owner may grant a license to use. For example, a contract for hire or by way of hire in a contract of bailment. The hirer obtains a right to use the chattel hired in return of payment to the owner for the price of hiring. The proprietary interest in the chattle does not change and remains with the owner, though upon delivery of the chattle, the hirer becomes legally possessed. If the hiring is for a particular time, the true owner may be barred during that time from resuming possession against hirer‟s will and, should he do so, the owner would liable for damages for wrongful seizure.",

                        "content": "Intellectual property rights are intangible as their subject matter emanates from human intellect. They could be treated as partially tangible when documented. Intellectual property rights can be dealt with like both movable and immoveable property, for it can be assigned/transferred, mortgaged or licensed. Transfer of intellectual property rights by way of sale or assignment when complete or absolute, results in exclusive rights being conferred on the transferee or the assignee, who becomes the new owner and is entitled to exercise all rights as an owner. The owner, however, need not transfer complete ownership and can grant a license or permission to use to a third party, one or more acts. The license granted amounts to permission to use, the intellectual property rights. The rights conferred on the licensee may vary. The right to use may be in respect of a single act, restricted to a location or for a limited period of time or duration. It may be a one-time act or there can be stipulations as to upgradation or right to access future technological advances. One of the important attributes of intellectual property rights in cases of technology, patent etc. is confidentiality. It is confidentiality, which gives the owner  the commercial edge, competitive position and superiority. Confidentiality enforces monopoly. Confidentiality and monopoly are the most valuable rights which the owner possesses and commercially exploits. License to use know-how or technology is, therefore, and often given with riders and condition to maintain confidentiality to ensure that the valuable asset of the licensor is preserved and secured. Thus, the owner can grant a trail of licenses to third parties with identical or similar limited rights of use with the confidentiality clause and without assignment or transfer of ownership. The price agreed, between the licensor and the licensee for right to use, could depend upon several factors. The commitment by the licensee not to disclose the know-how or technology to third parties, except under certain conditions or with the consent of the licensor, being one of the foremost factors. A license is personally and generally would not be transferable or assignable. A licensee, who has granted right to use cannot sue on his own name, without making the licensor a party, whereas an assignee/transferee can sue for infringement without joining the assignor.",

                        "content": "This is indeed the true and appropriate test, which has to be applied. Paragraph 11 DCM Limited (supra) specifically makes reference to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in N.V. Philips versus Commissioner of Income Tax (No. 1), (1988) 172 ITR 521 and it was held that the said decision was related to transfer or use of technology as it provided that the information disclosed under the agreement would remain confidential and would not become property of the Indian company till such time and to  such extent the information became public by application or user. Similar clause as quoted above exists in the present case also. In N.V. Philips (supra), Shyamal Kumar Sen, J. while concurring with the judgment of the Dipak Kumar Sen, J. held as under:- “A distinction must be made between letting the licensed asset for use on the one hand and transferring its substance by alienation (regarding the deviation of US MC, see infra m. no. 63). The decisive difference in this connection is the degree of change in the attribution of the asset from licensor to licensee. On the other hand, another distinction to be made is letting the proprietory right, experience, etc., on the one hand and use of it by the licensor himself, e.g., within the framework of an advisory activity. Within the range from „services‟, via „letting‟ to „alienation‟, outright alienation is the one clear-cut extreme, viz. outright transfer of the asset involved (right, etc.) to the payer of the royalty. The other, just as clear-cut extreme is the exercise by the payee of activities in the service of the payer, activities for which the payee uses his own proprietary rights, know-how, etc., while not letting or transferring them to the payer (for more details regarding the distinction between licensing and the provision of services, see infra m.nos. 54ff., in connection with the various subjects of licences). Neither extreme comes under Art. 12, all that does is the central category, viz. „letting‟.”  “While agreeing with my learned brother, I wish to add the following :  - The facts that the company would keep all information received from the assessee solely for the purpose of its use in its factory and would treat the same as having been disclosed in confidence and that it shall not become the property of the company until such time as and to the extent that such information or any part thereof becomes public. As a result, the user or disclosure really shows that the assessee treated the said processes and information as its own exclusive property and did not part with the same except on the above restriction. The analogy of a teacher in parting with his knowledge to the pupil cannot have any application because the teacher does not impose such restriction. It has been expressly provided in that agreement that the company agreed that it would take all reasonable care to keep such information confidential and not to disclose the same to any third parties and it only shows that this is in the nature of an exclusive right or property of the nonresident assessee and permission was granted only to utilise the same for its own specific use in a particular manner by the Indian company. It was further provided that the Indian company would not copy the equipment, tools and instruments or any part thereof supplied by the assessee to the company nor would cause or permit the same to be copied.  Although no licence has been granted by the owner of a patent in this case, this is analogous to the position of a patent-owner granting a licence because this is really a permission granted to use the secret process exclusively in a particular manner and it is meant only for the Indian company and not to be disclosed to any third parties. Therefore, it is clear that the non-resident assessee itself treated the method of manufacturing process carried on by it as its exclusive secret process over which it had exclusive domain and wanted the same to be kept a secret and not meant for the public and granted the company right to utilise the same only in the aforesaid restricted manner. This secret knowledge in this case is as much its capital asset as is a patent, a monopoly and a capital asset of the patentee as observed by Romer L.J. in the case of Handley Page [1935] 19  TC 328. This secret process which the non-resident assessee-company is parting with in this case is analogous to the parting of a monopoly right of the patentee and, therefore, the remuneration received by the assessee for the same should be treated as royalty and for the reasons as aforesaid, the answer to the question referred should be in the affirmative and in favour of the Revenue.”",

There was no attempt on the part of the foreign party to part with technical knowledge absolutely in favour of the Indian assessee as the said secret processes were not sold, but right to use was granted for a limited time. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Triveni Engineering Works Limited versus Commissioner of Income Tax, (1982) 136 ITR 340 (Del.) to draw a distinction between outright sale and supply of technical information and details with the copyright and the intellectual property rights remaining with the foreign company. In the said case, agreement was valid for ten years, but could be terminated earlier and was limited to India. The agreement stipulated that documents, dies etc. were to be absolute property of the Indian assessee, yet the copyright remain vested with the foreign company and the assessee has been given licence to use  the same during the agreement. Complete confidentiality was postulated. In the said case, it was held that the licensee had acquired merely right to use and mention of the word „sold‟ in the agreement would not undo the real effect that there was no sale of technical know-how and the assessee‟s rights were hedged with all sort of conditions.",

                        "content": "No doubt, the agreement in the present case refers to the tenure of five years unless it is terminated earlier, but the confidentiality obligation subsists and would be applicable even subsequently. It does not matter that no lumpsum payment or periodical payments were required to be made after five years, if what was conferred and granted to HCL was mere right to use or permission to use the intellectual rights and knowhow. As noticed above, lump-sum payments are covered under the term „royalty‟. The agreement postulated grant of permission to use or right to use intellectual property rights or knowhow and it is not a case of outright sale. Mode and manner is not determinative, but nature and character of the right acquired is definitive and decisive criteria.",

                        "content": "The period of five years cannot be read in isolation and would necessarily have reference to the commercial life of the intellectual property rights for which permission or right was granted. Repeatedly it has been held that intellectual property rights in scientific processes, technology etc. have limited time scale benefit and have invariably a short life span, due to rapid progress and advancement in such fields. In Alembic Chemicals Works Co. Ltd. vs. CIT (1989) 177 ITR 377 (SC) with reference to rapid advances and research in micro biology, it was observed that it would not be correct to attribute a degree of durability and  permanence to technical knowhow in medical sciences. The same principle would be equally applicable, as it has not been shown or indicated that the right to use technology had an enduring or long term commercial benefit. The clause relating to upgradation, elimination and discontinuance of manufacture by ADC, reflects the fleeting and momentary life span of the technical information. In Alembic chemical (supra) elucidating the said facets, it was held that acquisition in such fields with rapid and fast strides indicate grant of right to use of knowhow, rather than ownership acquisition. This aspect, when read cumulatively with restrictions on the right of the assessee in dealing with knowhow and conditions as to non-partibility, confidentiality and secrecy, reference to intellectual property rights of ADC and their protection, reflect and re-enforce our finding. ADC continued and remained the owner. The appellant HCL was only granted a right to use.",

                        "content": "The counsel for the appellant HCL had placed before us two comparative charts to show a similarity between the clauses of the agreement in DCM Ltd. (supra) and in the present case. However, we do not find adequate and sufficient similarity. In DCM Ltd. (supra), an agreement envisaged a transfer of comprehensive technical knowhow  which included of trade secrets, technical information – tangible and intangible including documents, process description, process flow diagrams and it was a case of full transfer of rights but in the form of non -transferable licence to practice the „TALO‟ processes in the assessee‟s existing factories with a right to sub-licence the rights to any other Indian party provided the terms and conditions of sub-licences were previously agreed by the foreign party also. It was a case of transfer of full rights, though even after transfer Indian assessee could not have further transferred the same except with express consent. Reference must be made to nature and type of technical information transferred and its life span in commercial sense. There are other distinguishing features which we have dealt with and noticed above to hold that HCL Ltd. was only permitted and allowed use and right to use. Absolute and complete transfer is clearly missing in the present case.",

                        "content": "The income tax returns filed by an assessee and further information that is provided during the assessment proceedings may also include confidential information relating to the business or the affairs of an assessee. An assessee is expected to truly and fairly disclose particulars relevant for the purposes of assessment of income tax. The nature of the disclosure required is not limited only to information that has been placed by an assessee in public domain but would also include information which an assessee may consider confidential. As a matter of illustration, one may consider a case of a manufacturer who manufactures and deals in multiple products for supplies to different agencies. In the normal course, an Assessing Officer would require an assessee to disclose profit margins on sales of such products. Such information would clearly disclose the pricing policy of the assessee and public disclosure of this information may clearly jeopardise the bargaining power available to the assessee since the data as to costs would be available to all agencies dealing with the assessee. It is, thus, essential that information relating to business affairs, which is considered to be confidential by an assessee must remain so, unless it is necessary in larger public interest to disclose the same. If the nature of information is such that disclosure of which may have the propensity of harming one’s competitive interests, it would not be necessary to specifically show as to how disclosure of such information would, in fact, harm the competitive interest of a third party. In order to test the applicability of Section 8(1)(d) of the Act it is necessary to first and  foremost determine the nature of information and if the nature of information is confidential information relating to the affairs of a private entity that is not obliged to be placed in public domain, then it is necessary to consider whether its disclosure can possibly have an adverse effect on third parties.",

The Supreme Court in the case of CBSE v. Aditya Bandopadhyay: (2011) 8 SCC 497 had explained that the words “information available to a person in its fiduciary relationship” could not be construed in a wide sense but has to be considered in the normal and recognized sense. The relevant extract of the said decision is quoted below:- \"41. In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies can be said to act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to the students who participate in an examination, as a Government does while governing its citizens or as the present generation does with reference to the future generation while preserving the environment. But the words “information available to a person in his fiduciary relationship” are used in Section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act in its normal and well-recognised sense, that is, to refer to persons who act in a fiduciary capacity, with reference to a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries who are to be expected to be protected or benefited by the actions of the fiduciary—a trustee with reference to the beneficiary of the trust, a guardian with reference to a minor/physically infirm/mentally challenged, a parent with reference to a child, a lawyer or a chartered accountant with reference to a client, a doctor or nurse with reference to a patient, an agent with  reference to a principal, a partner with reference to another partner, a Director of a company with reference to a shareholder, an executor with reference to a legatee, a Receiver with reference to the parties to a lis, an employer with reference to the confidential information relating to the employee, and an employee with reference to business dealings/transaction of the employer. We do not find that kind of fiduciary relationship between the examining body and the examinee, with reference to the evaluated answer books, that come into the custody of the examining body.\"",

In the case of Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T Inc: 2011 US LEXIS 1899 the US Supreme Court considered the meaning of the expression “personal privacy” in the context of the Freedom of Information Act, which required Federal Agencies to make certain records and documents publically available on request. Such disclosure was exempt if the records “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy”. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the expression “Personal” used in the aforesaid context could not be extended to corporations because the word “personal” ordinarily refers to individuals. The Court held that the expression “personal” must be given its ordinary meaning. The relevant extract of the said judgment is as under:  ““Person” is a defined term in the statute; “personal” is not. When a statute does not define a term, we typically “give the phrase its ordinary meaning.” (<http://www.lexis.com/research/buttonTFLink?_m=a7d5373f92b90f4dbb2efe297c4372b7&_xfercite=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b131%20S.%20Ct.%201177%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_butType=3&_butStat=2&_butNum=139&_butInline=1&_butinfo=%3ccite%20cc%3d%22USA%22%3e%3c%21%5bCDATA%5b176%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201%2c%208%5d%5d%3e%3c%2fcite%3e&_fmtstr=FULL&docnum=1&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLzVzt-zSkAz&_md5=6a32810154489062e9115a3a4b16b02a>)Johnson v.

We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence, or personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities. This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence, influence, or tragedies of their own, only that we do not use the word “personal” to describe them.  Certainly, if the chief executive officer of a corporation approached the chief financial officer and said, “I have something personal to tell you,” we would not assume the CEO was about to discuss company business. Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, “that's personal.” A company spokesman, when asked for information about the company, would not. In fact, we often use the word “personal” to mean precisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company's view.  Dictionaries also suggest that “personal” does not ordinarily relate to artificial “persons” such as corporations. See, e.g., 7 OED 726 (1933) (“[1] [o]f, pertaining to . . . the individual person or self,” “individual; private; one's own,” “[3] [o]f or pertaining to one's person, body, or figure,” “[5] [o]f, pertaining to, or characteristic of a person or self-conscious being, as opposed to a thing or abstraction”); 11 OED at 599-600 (2d ed. 1989) (same); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1686 (1976) (“[3] relating to the person or body”; “[4] relating to an individual, his character, conduct, motives, or private affairs”; “[5] relating to or characteristic of human beings as distinct from things”); ibid.

The expression ‘individual’ must be construed in an expansive sense and would include a body of individuals. The said exemption would be available even to unincorporated entities as also private, closely held undertaking which are in substance alter egos of their shareholders. However, the expression individual cannot be used as a synonym for the expression ‘person’. Under the General Clauses Act, 1897 a person is defined to “include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not”. Thus, whereas a person would include an individual as well as incorporated entities and artificial persons, the expression ‘individual’ cannot be interpreted to include such entities. The context in which, the expression “personal information” is used would also exclude it application to large widely held corporations. While, confidential information of a corporation is exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act, there is no scope to exclude other information relating to such corporations under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act as the concept of a personal information cannot in ordinary language be understood to mean information pertaining to a public corporation.",

The Court also clearly stated that the information supplied by a society to the Registrar of Societies could be disclosed except for the information that was exempt under Section 8(1) of the Act and that included accounts maintained by members of society. The relevant passage from the said judgment is quoted below:- \"52. Registrar of Cooperative Societies functioning under the Cooperative Societies Act is a public authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Act. As a public authority, Registrar of Co-operative Societies has been conferred with lot of statutory powers under the respective Act under which he is functioning. He is also duty bound to comply with the obligations under the RTI Act and furnish information to a citizen under the RTI Act. Information which he is expected to provide is the information enumerated in Section 2(f) of the RTI Act subject to the limitations provided under Section 8 of the Act. Registrar can also, to the extent law permits, gather information from a Society, on which he has supervisory or administrative control under the Cooperative Societies Act. Consequently, apart from the information as is available to him, under Section 2(f), he can also gather those information from the Society, to the extent permitted by law. Registrar is also not obliged to disclose those information if those information fall under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act. No provision has been brought to our knowledge indicating that, under the Cooperative Societies Act, a Registrar can call for the details of the bank accounts maintained by the citizens or members in a cooperative bank . Only those information which a Registrar of Cooperative Societies can have access under the Cooperative Societies Act from a Society could be said to be the information which is “held” or “under the control of public authority”. Even those information, Registrar, as already indicated, is not legally obliged to provide if those information falls under the exempted  category mentioned in Section 8(j) of the Act. Apart from the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, there may be other public authorities who can access information from a Co-operative Bank of a private account maintained by a member of Society under law, in the event of which, in a given situation, the society will have to part with that information.

(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) or any other law for the time being in force, the Central Government may, having regard to the practices and usages customary or any other relevant factors, by order notified in the Official Gazette, direct that no information or document shall be furnished or produced by a public servant in respect of such matters relating to such class of assessees or except to such authorities as may be specified in the order.”",

The said controversy was answered by the following words:- “It is undoubtedly open to the authorities to disclose information received by them from assessments or other proceedings under the Act. However, there are restrictions contained in Section 138 as now existing concerning the manner in which that information is to be disclosed. Leaving aside sub-clause (a) of sub-section (1) it seems that under sub-clause (b), the Commissioner can disclose information if he is satisfied that it is within the public interest to do so. Hence, if some other authority applies to the Commissioner to obtain information, the same may be disclosed in the discretion of the Commissioner. Under Sub-clause (a) there is also a power to furnish information to other authorities. As this matter has not been fully argued or discussed in the present case, it is sufficient to note that there is no power to disclose information to other authorities and officers outside the provisions of the Section. As far as the information already given is concerned, we have no power to give any direction concerning the same.”",

Undoubtedly, the income tax returns and information provided to Income Tax Authorities by assessees is confidential and not required to be placed in public domain. Given the nature of the income tax returns and the information necessary to support the same, it would be exempt under Section 8(1)(j) of the Act in respect of individual and unincorporated assessees. The information as disclosed in  the income tax returns would qualify as personal information with regard to several private companies which are, essentially, alter egos of their promoters. However, in cases of widely held companies most information relating to their income and expenditure would be in public domain and the confidential information would be exempt from disclosure under Section 8(1)(d) of the Act. Further, even in cases of corporate entities, the income tax returns and other disclosure made to authorities would also include transactions with other parties and those parties can also claim the exception under Section 8(1) of the Act. One has to also bear in mind that an authority may not have any obligation to provide any information other than in the form in which it is available and the information provided by an assessee may not have been edited to remove references to other persons. Keeping all the aforesaid considerations in view, the parliament has enacted Section 138 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to provide for disclosure only where it is necessary in public interest. Similar provisions are enacted under the Act and clauses (d), (e) and (j) of Section 8(1) of the Act that specify that information exempt from disclosure under those clauses, could be disclosed in larger public interest. Section 8(2) of the Act also provides for a non obstante clause which permits disclosure of information in larger public interest.",

The CIC arrived at this conclusion by noting that disclosure of information was in larger public interest in increasing public revenue and reducing corruption. The assessment proceedings are not public proceedings where all and sundry are allowed to participate and add their opinion to the proceedings. Merely because a spirited citizen  wishes to assist in assessment proceedings, the same cannot be stated to be in larger public interest. On the contrary, larger public interest would require that assessment proceedings are completed expeditiously and by the authorities who are statutorily empowered to do so.",

                        "content": "In the present case, there was no material to indicate that there was any corruption on the part of the income tax authorities which led to a justifiable apprehension that the said authorities were not performing their function diligently. In any event, the CIC has not found that the proceedings relating to assessment were not being conducted in accordance with law and/or required the intervention of the respondent. Assessment proceedings are quasi-judicial proceedings where assessee has to produce material to substantiate their return of income. Income tax has to be assessed by the income tax authorities strictly in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961 and based on the information sought by them. In the present case, the respondent wants to process the information to assist and support the role of an Assessing Officer. This has a propensity of interfering in the assessment proceedings and thus, cannot be considered to be in larger public interest. The CIC had proceeded on the basis that the income tax authorities should disclose information to informers of income tax departments to enable them to bring instances of tax evasion to the notice of income tax authorities. In my view, this reasoning is flawed as it would tend to subvert the assessment process rather than aid it. If this idea is carried to its logical end, it would enable several busy bodies to interfere in assessment proceedings and throw up their interpretation of law and facts as to how an assessment ought to be carried out. The propensity of this to  multiply litigation cannot be underestimated. Further, the proposition that unrelated parties could intervene in assessment proceedings is wholly alien to the Income Tax Act, 1961. The income tax returns and information are provided in aid of the proceedings that are conducted under that Act and there is no scope for enhancing or providing for an additional dimension to the assessment proceedings.",

Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi: (2012) 13 SCC 61 held that the statutory exemption provided under Section 8 of the Act is the rule and only in exceptional circumstances of larger public interest the information would be disclosed. It was also held that ‘public purpose’ needs to be interpreted in the strict sense and public interest has to be construed keeping in mind the balance between right to privacy and right to information. The relevant extract from the said judgment is quoted below:  “21. ...... Another very significant provision of the Act is Section 8(1)(j). In terms of this provision, information which relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual would fall within the exempted category, unless the authority concerned is satisfied that larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information. It is, therefore, to be understood clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as a rule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be permitted, that too, for reasons to be recorded demonstrating satisfaction to the test of larger public interest. It will not be in consonance with the spirit of these provisions, if in a mechanical manner, directions are passed by the appropriate authority to disclose information which may be protected in terms of the above provisions. All information which has come  to the notice of or on record of a person holding fiduciary relationship with another and but for such capacity, such information would not have been provided to that authority, would normally need to be protected and would not be open to disclosure keeping the higher standards of integrity and confidentiality of such relationship.

Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there may be cases where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual. All these protections have to be given their  due implementation as they spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the balance factor between right to privacy and right to information with the purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge from the constitutional values under the Constitution of India.”",
