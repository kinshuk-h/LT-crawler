This Court finds merit in the contention of the Plaintiffs that Defendant No. 1 by using the trademarks „INDIABULLS‟, „DHANI‟ and  (device), which are identical to the Plaintiffs‟ registered trademarks as well as by creating and operating the impugned domain name www.indiabullsdhanifinance.co, which is deceptively similar to Plaintiffs‟ domain names www.indianbulls.com and www.indiabullsdhani.com, is infringing the statutory rights of the Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1, under the aforesaid trademarks is providing services relating to financial transactions, personal loans etc., which are similar to those of the Plaintiffs and the consumer base is also the same.

Plaintiffs have been continuously and extensively using the trademarks for their financial services, which is evident from the combined revenue of over Rs.14,640 crores as on 31.03.2019 of Plaintiff No. 1 and over Rs.1650 crores as on 31.03.2019 in respect of Plaintiff No. 2. Promotional and advertisement expenses run into Rs.47,24,92,990 for the financial years 2017-2019. The website as displayed is likely to lead the  unwary consumers to assume a business connection between Defendant No. 1 and the Plaintiffs. Documents further evidence that Defendant No. 1 has been sending messages/e-mails to potential customers, portraying itself as a part of Plaintiffs‟ companies and was also sending links for payments for loan applications with bank account details. Defendant No. 1 has also published a number on its website which, according to the averment in the plaint, though unrebutted, on the TrueCaller shows as „India Bulls Tollfree‟. In light of the said facts and the settled law, this Court finds that Defendant No. 1 has committed the tort of passing off.",

In this behalf, learned Counsel has relied upon the judgments of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited v. Selection Footwear, 1999 PTC (19) 578; Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances, 1999 PTC (19) 685; and CS (OS) 2711/1999, L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co., 123 (2005) DLT 503 decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs. 3 lakh were awarded in favour of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, 125 (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the Court and they should not be permitted to enjoy  the benefits of evasion of Court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appear in Court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the Court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavour should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.",

If punitive damages are not awarded in such cases, it would only encourage unscrupulous persons who actuated by dishonest intention, use the well-reputed trademark of another person, so as to encash on the goodwill and reputation which that mark enjoys in the market, with impunity, and then avoid payment of damages by remaining absent from the Court, thereby depriving the plaintiff an opportunity to establish actual profit earned by him from use of the infringing mark, which can be computed  only on the basis of his account books.

He also relied upon the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Phonepe Private Limited v. EZY Services and Another : 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2635, in support of his contention. The learned Single Judge, in the facts of the said case, had held as under:  “63. Mr. Mehta sought to place reliance on the observation, in this decision, that that the defendant was estopped from contending that the plaintiff's mark was generic or descriptive, as it had applied for registration of a similar mark. There are two reasons why this observation, though it unquestionably finds place in the judgement, cannot help Mr. Mehta's client. Firstly, even if the defendant were to be estopped taking such a defence, the Court, adjudicating the claim of infringement, cannot ignore either Section 9(1)(b) (which prohibits registration of descriptive trade marks) or 30(2)(a) (which postulates that there can be no infringement of a descriptive trade mark), which are in the nature of statutory interdictions. Secondly, the defendant, in the present case, has applied for registration of the entire ‘BharatPe’ mark, and not merely of the suffix ‘Pe’. No plea of estoppel can, therefore, inhibit the defendant from contending that the suffix ‘Pe’ is generic and descriptive in nature.” (emphasis supplied)",

This wholesome doctrine, the learned Judge held, applies not only to successive stages of the same suit, but also to another suit than the one in which the position was taken up, provided the second suit grows out of the judgment in the first.” (Emphasis Supplied)  Applying the said principles of law to the present case, it is apparent that if the defendant is allowed to re-agitate, it would also lead to allowing the party to approbate and reprobate at the same time which is clearly impermissible.

The fact that the defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary right and monopoly in “DIMMER DOT”, it does not lie in their mouth to say that the word “DIMMER” is a generic expression.

It was also held that such statutory right cannot be lost merely on the question of principles of delay, laches or acquiescence.

We have weighed the rival contentions aforesaid and do not find any merit in this appeal for the following reasons:  (xvi) There is a difference between words/marks which would classify as descriptive, generally of the goods or services, whosoever may be provider thereof and words/marks which communicate the particular/peculiar quality/qualities or  features of product of one and which may not exist or do not exist in the same product being provided by others. In our opinion, it is only the former which are not registrable as trademark and which are not protected, and not the latter. The words “marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purposes, values…of the goods” in Section 9(1)(b) cannot be read to include words/marks which designate the quality, intended purpose or values, not generic to the goods and services but unique to the goods of one and which may not be present in the same goods and services provided by another. Such words/marks, highlight and communicate to the consumer the difference claimed from the same goods or services of others, also available in the market. of course, such words or marks would also be, in a sense descriptive of those unique features, quality, character, intended purpose of goods/services of one; however they will still classify as distinctive so long as none other till then has described those as unique to the product.  (xxii) As far as the reliance on Marico Limited (supra) is concerned, the decision of the Division Bench therein turned on the finding of the trade mark “LOW-ABSORB” being descriptive of the product in that case. We have herein above held that the words “ALLROUND PROTECTION” in relation to the product with which this case is concerned are not descriptive generally of toothpastes, by whosoever manufactured/supplied but show the  peculiar quality, features/advantages in the product of the respondent/plaintiff which may not be present in the same product of others.",

The present suit has been filed seeking recovery of the aforesaid amount.

Upon a conspectus of the timelines as set-out above and in light of the provisions of the CPC as amended by the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division & Commercial Appellate Division Of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018read in conjunction with the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules 2018, as also the judicial precedents referred to by the parties, this court is of the view that written statement having been filed within the statutory period; and the defect of non-filing of the affidavit of admission/denial also having been cured well within the permissible time period, nothing further stands in the way of the written statement being taken on record.",

                        "content": "For clarity, it is reiterated that what Order V Rule 1(1) and Order VIII Rule 1 CPC provide is the outer time-limit for filing of the written statement of defence. The filling by the defendant of an affidavit of admission/denial of the plaintiff’s documents, is a separate requirement under Chapter VII Rule 3 and 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018; and the consequence for not filing such affidavit is that the written statement shall not be taken on record and that the plaintiff’s documents shall be deemed to be admitted by the defendant. However, the filing of a written statement within the prescribed time but without an accompanying affidavit of admission/denial of documents, does not amount to non-est filing, since it cannot be said that nothing was filed at all. It would, however, amount to a defect, that is required to be cured after it is brought to the attention of the party by the Registry. Chapter VII Rule 3 only bars taking on record a written statement that is filed without an accompanying affidavit of admission/denial of documents. Filing of the written statement and it being taken on record are two separate and distinct matters.”",

On 29th August, 2022, the Registry pointed out only two defects in respect of the said filing, that (i) the affidavit was not attested; and, (ii) the proof of service was not attached. Again, from the e-filing log, it appears that the aforenoted two defects were removed by the defendant on the very next day i.e., 30th August, 2022 and a written statement along with an attested affidavit and an affidavit of admission/denial of documents notarized on 29th August, 2022 along with proof of service were filed. Thereafter, the Registry did not mark any further defects. Therefore, in the present case, the written statement was filed within the maximum condonable statutory period, even if the same was not taken on record within the said period. Further, the defects were also cured within the permissible time period prescribed under the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018.",

The words ‗arising out of‘ used in Section 2(1)(c) have to be given their natural and ordinary meaning, which would mean to include all disputes involving intellectual property rights of a party. In the present case, the suit filed by the plaintiff before the US District Court was based on infringement of intellectual property rights of the plaintiff in the United States, wherein the US District Court passed an order of permanent injunction and awarded damages to the plaintiff amounting to USD 1,000,000/-along with attorney fees of USD 39,268/-. The present suit has been filed seeking recovery of the aforesaid amount. Since the United States of America is not a reciprocating territory under Section 44A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), the plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking of recovery of amounts awarded by the US  District Court. Further, as is evident from the judgment of the US District Court placed on record by the plaintiff, the entire cause of action for filing of the present suit is based on the infringement of intellectual property rights of the plaintiff by the defendant in the United States of America. Therefore, in my view, the present suit would be covered within the definition of ‗commercial dispute‘ in terms of Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the Commercial Courts Act.",

The Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprises Limited (supra) has also observed that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act have to be strictly construed. Even if that be so, the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act have to be given their full effect. Further, the use of the words ‗arising out of‘ in Section 2(1)(c) leaves no doubt in my mind that all suits based on enforcement of intellectual property rights would be covered under sub-clause (xvii) of Section 2(1)(c). Similarly, the observations of the Coordinate Bench in Qatar Airways Q.C.S.C (supra) would be of no assistance to the defendant as the present suit falls within the category of transactions listed under Section 2(1)(c) of the Commercial Courts Act.",

The filling by the defendant of an affidavit of admission/denial of the plaintiff’s documents, is a separate requirement under Chapter VII Rule 3 and 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018; and the consequence for not filing such affidavit is that the written statement shall not be taken on record and that the plaintiff’s documents shall be deemed to be admitted by the defendant. However, the filing of a written statement within the prescribed time but without an accompanying affidavit of admission/denial of documents, does not amount to non-est filing, since it cannot be said that nothing was filed at all. It would, however, amount to a defect, that is required to be cured after it is brought to the attention of the party by the Registry. Chapter VII Rule 3 only bars taking on record a written statement that is filed without an accompanying affidavit of admission/denial of documents. Filing of the written statement and it being taken on record are two separate and distinct matters.‖",

On 29th August, 2022, the Registry pointed out only two defects in respect of the said filing, that (i) the affidavit was not attested; and, (ii) the proof of service was not attached. Again, from the e-filing log, it appears that the aforenoted two defects were removed by the defendant on the very next day i.e., 30th August, 2022 and a written statement along with an attested affidavit and an affidavit of admission/denial of documents notarized on 29th August, 2022 along with proof of service were filed.
