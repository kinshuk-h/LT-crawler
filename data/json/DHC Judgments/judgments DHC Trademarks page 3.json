The conceded case of the appellant in the plaint is  that he has received a call on June 5, 2006, that is a day before the last date of deadline, from the defendant No.7 requesting the transfer of files handled by the appellant. It is clear that the work of filing the 31 Notices of Opposition was taken away from the appellant. So, there was no reason for the appellant to prepare/file those Notices of Opposition. In fact, it is not the case of the appellant that he has filed the 31 Notices of Opposition with Registrar of Trademark. Despite that the invoice for 31 Notice of Operation was raised by the appellant on June 07, 2006.",

According to them, if the appellant had prepared the draft notices before June 05, 2006, there is no reason why they were never sent for approval. In other words, as the appellant neither prepared the draft of Notices of Opposition, nor filed it, there was no  reason for them to pay for the invoice raised on June 07, 2006. This reasoning of the respondents is justified. That apart, in the absence of invoice being on record, it cannot be said that whether the same was raised for preparing the Notices of Opposition or for filing the same. It can be argued that the invoice was raised by the appellant for incurring expenses for preparing the Notices of Opposition. Such a stand could have been justified the invoice provided the appellant had sent the draft notices and raised invoice for the purpose of preparing them. It is not such a case, nor can it be ascertained, in the absence of same being on record / produced.",

With respect to physical condition being changed or impaired, even in the absence of a statutory provision, the registered proprietor of a trade mark would have the right to oppose further dealing in those goods inasmuch as they would be the same goods improperly so called, or to put it differently, if a physical condition of goods is changed, it would no longer be the same goods. But, sub-section 4 of Section 30 is not restricted to only when the conditions of the goods has been changed or impaired after they have been put on the market. The section embraces all legitimate reasons to oppose further dealings in the goods. Thus, changing condition or impairment is only a specie of the genus legitimate reasons, which genus embraces other species as well. What are these species?

The only other question to be examined is the claim of damages of Rs. 20 lakh made in para 48(iii) (repeated) of the plaint. In this behalf, learned Counsel has  relied upon the judgments of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited v. Selection Footwear, 1999 PTC (19) 578; Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances, 1999 PTC (19) 685; and CS (OS) 2711/1999, L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co., 123 (2005) DLT 503 decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs. 3 lakh were awarded in favour of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, 125 (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the Court and they should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of Court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appear in Court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the Court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavour should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.",

Thus, a particular element of a composite mark which enjoys greater prominence vis-a-vis other constituent elements, may be termed as a „dominant mark‟.” It was further held that “the principle of „anti-dissection‟ does not impose an absolute embargo upon the consideration of the constituent elements of a composite mark. The said elements may be viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of „anti-dissection‟ and identification of „dominant mark‟ are not antithetical to one another and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles rather compliment each other.”",

In FMI Ltd.  (supra), this Court, while dealing with the case where the defendant was a distributor of the plaintiff-firm has observed as under:  “19. Before comparing the two trademarks for any similarities in the present case, one has to keep in mind the background in which the defendant adopted the trademark in respect of its product. It is not disputed that M/s. Sudesh Hardware Pvt. Ltd. (defendant No. 3), of which Mr.Ashok Jain (defendant No. 1) was a henchman, was the distributor of the plaintiff for over 25 years. As distributor, they were selling the goods of the plaintiff with trademark FREEMANS. Mr.Ashok Jain has now started the firm FREEDOM MEASURES (defendant No. 2) and under banner he has started manufacturing the same product, namely measuring tapes, and has adopted the trademark FREEDOM. Case of the plaintiff is that, as distributor of the plaintiff's product for 25 years, Mr. Ashok Jain came to be recognized in the market as FREEDOM FITEWALLA and with such a reputation acquired while working as distributor for the plaintiff, adoption of the trademark FREEDOM, after starting its own business and producing the same product, would obviously not be bona fide. It is clear that the defendants wanted to encash upon the goodwill of the plaintiff's product in which they had themselves trader for quarter of a century. When the two words FREEDOM and FREEMANS are compared in the aforesaid backdrop, and the person who was up to now selling the goods of FREEMANS and comes out with the goods with the trademark FREEDOM, with same customers, it is bound to cause confusion in the minds of the customers. The two words may not be exactly same, but adoption of the word FREEDOM, which resembles closely with the trademark FREEMANS of the plaintiff, with same clientele, may lead to confusion. It is the word FREE appearing in the plaintiff's trademark which has been tried to be exploited by adopting the word FREEDOM. Had there not been any association of the defendants with the  plaintiff and they had not represented the plaintiff as its distributors for a long period of 25 years by selling their goods and establishing their own reputation as FREEDOM FITEWALLA, things could have been different. The customers who had been buying the goods of the plaintiff from the defendants earlier with prominence of FREE in their mind are likely to be confused that these are the same goods sold by the defendants and, therefore, are of the same quality and reputation. The fact that when the defendants were selling the goods of the plaintiff with the trademark FREEMANS and came to be known as FREEDOM FITEWALLA, it would show that the consumers did not perceive any difference between the words FREEMAN and FREEDOM. It is the word FREE appearing in the plaintiff's trademark FREEMANS which strikes in the mind of the users of the goods of the plaintiff for more than 50 years. Therefore, this case would almost be same as the case of Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. Hind Cycle Ltd., 1973 ILR Delhi Vol. 1 where the defendant, who had adopted the trademark ROYAL STAR, was injuncted as it was found that the plaintiff's trademark EASTERN STAR had acquired a reputation and came to be known to the public as STAR cycles or TARA BRAND CYCLES.",

Thus, certain distinctions sought to be projected by the defendants would not be able to remove the confusion which is likely to arise in the minds of the customers. It is stated at the cost of repetition that the adoption of the trademark FREEDOM by the defendants is utterly mala fide. When the defendants had been the distributors of the plaintiff's products and sold those products with the trademark FREEMANS for a long period and wanted their own production of the same product, why the word FREEDOM only came in the minds of the defendants to be adopted as trademark,  which bears close resemblance to the plaintiff's trademark FREEMANS, is one thing which is not explained by the defendants at all. It is a clever device opted by the defendants to adopt the trademark FREEDOM and, thereafter, in the cartons, etc. put some distinguishing features so as to press the same as defense when the plaintiff takes legal action, as the present one, against the defendants. The attempt is to confuse the customers by adopting the same name and features and to confuse the Court by trying to show the alleged dissimilarities. Such an attempt has to fail.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

In Dahiben v.

Admittedly, Defendant No.1’s website is specifically targeted towards Indian  customers, including Delhi, as averred in paragraphs 30, 31, 33, 37, 44 to 52 and 60 of the plaint and thus, cause of action has arisen within the territorial limits of this Court under Section 20(c) CPC; (c) this Court in Burger King Corporation v. Techchand Shewakramani & Ors., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 10881 and Exxon Mobil Corporation v. Exoncorp Private Limited, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 9193, has held that in a case involving trademark, infringement happens when a person ‘uses’ the mark in the course of the trade and ‘use’ would include ‘offer for sale’. As Defendant No. 1’s website offers counterfeit products for sale to customers at Delhi, suit is maintainable before this Court and applying the law propounded in  Millennium & Copthorne International Limited (supra), Banyan Tree Holding (P) Limited (supra) and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.

Plaintiffs have no affiliation/association/economic link with the said Company or any of its beneficiaries and plea of international exhaustion is not available to Defendant No. 2; and (j) principles under Section 30(3) of the Act, which embody the principle of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to Section 30(4) of the Act and there cannot be a more ‘legitimate’ reason than being a registered proprietor of a trademark, whose statutory and common law rights are being violated by the Defendants.",

In order to test the claim of the Plaintiffs with respect to jurisdiction under Section 20(c) CPC, it needs to be examined as to what constitutes ‘cause of action’, in respect of a suit alleging violation of intellectual property rights, more particularly, a claim for infringement and passing off, as in the present case. This question has been answered by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Burger King Corporation (supra), relying on the judgments in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra) and Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and relevant paras are as follows:- “19. What constitutes cause of action in the context of a suit alleging violation of rights in a trade mark, would therefore be the question. In a case involving trade mark infringement, infringement happens when a person “uses in the course of trade” any mark without the owner's consent. Thus, use of a mark is the cause of action in an infringement as also in a passing off action. If use takes place in a territory where the suit is filed, that Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit. When there is use of a mark, there is a cause of action to sue, where the use takes place. it is relevant to point out that “use” of a trademark as per Section 2(2)(c) of the TM Act is as under:  “(2) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, any reference - …  (c)  to the use of a mark- (i)  in relation to goods, shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark upon, or in any  physical or in any other relation whatsoever, to such goods;  (ii)  in relation to services, shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark as or as part of any statement about the availability, provision or performance of such services;”",

This position is maintained under the 1994 Act which, in section 10(4) and (5), follows the permissive provisions of Article 5(3) of the TM Directive in indentifying the various activities which constitute use of a sign for the purposes of the infringement provisions.  13-33  It is an infringement to use an offending sign on business papers on in advertising: this has always been the law. But with the wider definition of use including oral use of a trade mark it will now be an infringement to advertise using an offending mark by, for example, radio or through oral use of the mark by salesman.”",

Additionally, Defendant No. 1 operates its website, which specifically targets consumers based in Delhi and though the orders placed by the purchasers are fulfilled by Defendant No. 2, the transaction is entered into by the consumers at Delhi. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Plaintiffs do not have an outlet in Delhi, in this day and time, in my opinion, Defendants’ conduct of business through a website, where they offer goods for sale, targeting customers in Delhi, thereby raising queries, would confer jurisdiction on this Court as there is ‘offer for sale’ and consequently ‘use’ of the trademark, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Plaintiffs have filed a screenshot of the website of Defendant No. 1, showing availability of the products, alleged to be counterfeit and the same are accessible not only globally but also in India, including Delhi. The fact that the goods offered on this website are accessible to customers at Delhi and are also delivered, when an order is placed, is reflected from the ‘location PIN code’ appearing on the screenshot of the website:- Therefore, Plaintiffs are right in contending that the impugned products are being offered for sale in Delhi and this Court finds that they are also being sold and delivered to the customers at Delhi. In this context, this Court also relies on Section 29(6)(b) of the Act, which provides that a mere ‘offer for sale’ of an infringing product would constitute a cause of action for a claim for infringement under Section 29 of the Act.

This Court holds that jurisdiction of the forum court does not get attracted merely on the basis of interactivity of the website which is accessible in the forum state. The degree of the interactivity apart, the nature of the activity permissible and whether it results in a commercial transaction has to be examined. For the ‘effects’ test to apply, the Plaintiff must necessarily plead and show prima facie that the specific targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state. For the purposes of a passing off or an infringement action (where the plaintiff is not located within the jurisdiction of the court), the injurious effect on the Plaintiff's business, goodwill or reputation within the forum state as a result of the Defendant's website being accessed in the forum state would have to be shown. Naturally therefore, this would require the presence of the Plaintiff in the forum state and not merely the possibility of such presence in the future. Secondly, to show that an injurious effect has been felt by the Plaintiff it would have to be shown that viewers in the forum state were specifically targeted. Therefore the ‘effects’ test would have to be applied in conjunction with the “sliding scale” test to determine if the forum court has jurisdiction to try a suit concerning internet based disputes.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

This is consistent with the law laid down in Cybersell and reiterated later in Toys R Us. It is also consistent with the application of the ‘tighter’ version of the ‘effects’ test which is ‘targeting’. In any action for passing off or infringement, it would have to be shown that the Defendant by using its mark intended to pass off its goods as that of the Plaintiff's. A mere hosting of a website which can be accessible from anyone from within the jurisdiction of the court is not sufficient for this  purpose. Also a mere posting of an advertisement by the Defendant depicting its mark on a passive website which does not enable the Defendant to enter into any commercial transaction with the viewer in the forum state cannot satisfy the requirement of giving rise to a cause of action in the forum state. Even an interactive website, which is not shown to be specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions, will not result in the court of the forum state having jurisdiction. In sum, for the purposes of Section 20 (c) CPC, in order to show that some part of the cause of action has arisen in the forum state by the use of the internet by the Defendant, the Plaintiff will have to show prima facie that the said website, whether euphemistically termed as “passive plus” or “interactive” was specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions. The Plaintiff would have to plead this and produce material to prima facie show that some commercial transaction using the website was entered into by the Defendant with a user of its website within the forum state and that the specific targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state.

The stand of Defendant No. 2 is that it is not running a website by itself and in any case certainly not a website that offers goods carrying the trademarks of the Plaintiffs and that Defendant No. 1 runs a website on which customers place orders albeit Defendant No. 2 fulfils the orders, restricted to USA. In my view, the distinction sought to be brought out by Defendant No. 2 is inconsequential, insofar as the territorial jurisdiction of this Court is concerned, inasmuch as the commercial relationship between the Defendants is undisputed, as noted  above. Court finds strength in this view from the judgment of this Court in Millennium & Copthorne International Limited (supra), where it was held that if the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit owing to Defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and enabling Defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business at Delhi, there was no reason to hold that it will not be so where the Defendants, instead of hosting their own interactive website, avail the services of third party websites to carry on business at Delhi and there is no rationale for carving out such a distinction. Relevant para of the judgment is as follows:  “24. In continuation of what was held by the Division Bench in World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., I may state that the mode of booking/reserving rooms and other facilities particularly of dining therein, in hotels/resorts/spas, has changed over the years with maximum number of bookings/reservations being made through such third party websites, so much so that the rates available on the third party websites are also found to be considerably lower than the rates offered through traditional mode of agents or offices in major cities. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that much of the volume of businesses of hotels is now through such third party websites, in comparison to the business through direct bookings and/or through travel agents. Thus, if the Courts at Delhi will have jurisdiction over subject matter of suit owing to defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and enabling defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business at Delhi, I see no reason to hold that it will not be so where the defendants, instead of hosting its own interactive website, avails the service of third party websites to carry on business at Delhi. There is no rationale for carving out such a distinction. Certainly, making a booking/reservation, even if the same does not subsequently materialise, is part of carrying on business, inasmuch as the hotel which has taken the booking, even if has not received any payment, being unable to turn back a customer if shows up in pursuance to such booking. The defendants, by  showing on their websites, their location to be at Delhi, are also found to be attracting and luring the customers, otherwise intending to visit Delhi, into believing that the hotels and resorts of the defendants are at Delhi, though actually, territorially speaking, outside Delhi. The defendants, cannot be permitted to take different stand/position while carrying on business than before this Court. In any case, such acts of the defendants amount to specifically targeting the viewers at Delhi, within the meaning of Banyan Tree Holding (P) Ltd. supra.”",

It is not an offer but an invitation to an offer, just as a menu in a restaurant. The invitation, if accepted by a customer in Delhi, becomes an offer made by the customer in Delhi for purchasing the goods “advertised” on the website of the appellant/plaintiff. When, through the mode of the software and the browser, the transaction is confirmed and payment is made to the appellant/plaintiff through its website, the appellant/plaintiff accepts the offer of the customer at Delhi.

What we are examining is whether the third condition specified in Dhodha House (supra) is satisfied or not. In other words, if the contracts and/or transactions entered into between the appellant/plaintiff on the one hand and its customers are being  concluded in Delhi, can it not be said that the essential part of the business of the appellant/plaintiff, insofar as its transactions with customers in Delhi are concerned, takes place in Delhi? The offers are made by customers at Delhi. The offers are subject to confirmation/acceptance of the appellant/plaintiff through its website. The money would emanate or be paid from Delhi. Can it not then be considered that the appellant/plaintiff is, to a certain extent, carrying on business at Delhi? In our view, it would be so. Because of the advancements in technology and the rapid growth of new models of conducting business over the internet, it is possible for an entity to have a virtual presence in a place which is located at a distance from the place where it has a physical presence. The availability of transactions through the website at a particular place is virtually the same thing as a seller having shops in that place in the physical world. Let us assume for the sake of argument that the appellant/plaintiff had a shop in Delhi from where it sold its various goods and services. In that case, it could not be denied that the plaintiff carried on business in Delhi. This is apart from the fact that the appellant/plaintiff may also have been regarded as having voluntarily resided in Delhi. When the shop in the ‘physical sense’ is replaced by the ‘virtual’ shop because of the advancement of technology, in our view, it cannot be said that the appellant/plaintiff would not carry on business in Delhi.”",

The relief sought in the present suit is for infringement and passing off against the Defendants and in terms of the provisions of the Act as well as judgments alluded to above, offer to sell even on an interactive website targeting the customers in a particular State is enough to grant jurisdiction of the Court as well as to give cause of action to the Plaintiffs. A perusal of the ‘Terms and Conditions for the Global Store’ shows that the same apply when a customer purchases products from the Amazon Global Store and thereupon he acknowledges that the sale takes place in USA and is subject to laws and regulations of USA and that the State of Washington will have the exclusive jurisdiction. As rightly contended on behalf of the Plaintiffs, these Terms and Conditions purely govern relationships between a buyer and a seller, i.e., parties to the contract and do not bind the Plaintiffs who have filed the present case for violation of their statutory and common law rights against the Defendants for selling counterfeit products using their registered trademarks. Additionally, it is the offer for sale within the jurisdiction of this Court  which is the trigger for a cause of action, which may or may not be followed by an actual sale of the infringing product and therefore, it is irrelevant whether the sale takes place in India or outside. Since it is ‘offer for sale’, which is the cause of action and constitutes infringement under the provisions of the Act, the argument on behalf of the Defendants with respect to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is also misconceived. Insofar as judgments in Dahiben (supra) and Xavier D’Souza & Anr. (supra) are concerned, the proposition laid down in the said judgments cannot be disputed, however, these judgments are inapplicable to the present case. In Dahiben (supra), Plaintiffs had deliberately failed to mention the date of the registered sale-deed, which omission had an impact on the limitation for filing the suit. The Court found the omission to be deliberate and since it had impact on the limitation within which the suit could be filed, the Court upheld the order of the Trial Court rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.",

Even otherwise, at this stage, no proof of purported procurement or purchase has been filed by Defendant No. 2 to establish even prima facie that it has procured the infringing goods from a lawful source in USA, i.e., from BHPC Associates LLC, as alleged. Responding to the contention, Plaintiffs have sought to clarify that they have no affiliation or association or even an economic link with the said entity anywhere in the world and nor are they the beneficiaries of any transaction made by the Defendants with the said entity in relation to the infringing products. Learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs has also rightly argued that principles under Section 30(3) of the Act, which embody the principle of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to sub-Section (4) of  Section 30 and there can be no greater reason which can be termed as ‘legitimate’ than being the registered proprietor of the trademark.",

                        "content": "Principles that govern adjudication under Order VII Rule 11 CPC are well-settled. The Court is required to examine the plaint on a demurrer and see if the plaint sets out a cause of action which is triable by the Court. No doubt, as rightly contended by learned Senior Counsel for Defendant No. 2 and as held in Nawal Singh (supra), the documents filed along with the plaint can be seen, however, the Court cannot base its adjudication on the defence in the suit. In this context, I may refer to para 27 from the judgment in M/s RSPL Limited v. Mukesh Sharma and Another, 2016 SCC Online Del 4285, which is as follows:- “27. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name ‘GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY’. In paragraph 37 of the plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit. But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by ‘conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name’. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's  goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the  appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.”",

It is also averred that products are sold through the websites of their licensees. Plaintiffs have also averred that Defendant No. 1 is, through its website, offering the counterfeit products for sale which can be purchased by customers in Delhi and thus, this Court has jurisdiction, both under Section 134(2) of the Act and Section 20(c) of CPC. At this stage, the Court cannot examine the merits of the matter or take into account the defence set up by the Defendants albeit it is possible that Plaintiffs may not succeed finally in the suit. For the present, however, all that the Court can consider is  whether the plaint has disclosed any cause of action within its territorial jurisdiction, which for the aforesaid reasons it does.",

Vide order dated 3rd August, 2022, the following directions were issued:  “31. …Considering the large sums of money that are being fraudulently obtained from various unsuspecting customers, all due to the lack of an active mechanism identification of such fraudulent parties, it is clear to the Court that the following aspects need to be addressed in these matters:  (i)  The manner in which the details of the domain name registrants, can be verified by the DNRs, at the time of registration of domain names;  (ii)  The manner in which the privacy protect feature and proxy servers are made available: whether it is only upon a specific registrant  choosing the said option, rather than as a standard feature as part of a ‘bundle’;  (iii)  If the owner of a well-known brand or a trademark contacts any DNR, the manner in which the data related to the registrant can be provided, without the intervention of a Court, or any governmental agency;  (iv)  Whether the identity of the owner of a domain name, which consists of a registered trademark or a known brand can be verified at the time of registration itself;  (v)  If a specific link could be provided by the CGPTDM, covering a list of well-known marks, maintained by the Registrar of the Trademarks, or declared by any Court of law, which can then be used for expedited blocking of domain names consisting of such marks;  (vi)  If there can be any agency that can be identified in India, such as NIXI, who can be made a repository of the data concerning the registrant, or an agency through which the data could be transmitted by the DNR, upon verification by NIXI, in case a trademark owner has a grievance against a specific domain name;  (vii)  If any directions are issued to the DNRs, and the same are not implemented, the manner in which the implementation of the said orders can be ensured;  (viii)  Since almost all domain names are registered only after payments are made through credit card, or other online payment methods or apps, is it possible, upon request by any identified agency, to provide the information relating to the person who has made the payment, to the trademark owners. This should be discussed in the aforementioned meeting to be held on 30th August, 2022.  …",

The trademark STEELBIRD was coined by the plaintiff from the two words “steel” and “bird” respectively and is thus a fanciful and arbitrary mark in relation to helmets and auto-accessories, hence, inherently distinctive and exclusively associated with the plaintiff. Coupled with the long and continuous use of the trademark STEELBIRD, the plaintiff is entitled to the highest degree of trademark protection and exclusive rights therein.  Plaintiff in the suit has given its sales figure as also money spent on advertisement and promotions both in the print and electronic media since its inception.

On a search carried out by the plaintiff‟s attorney it was revealed that the defendant‟s mark SEABIRD was registered under Class 9 vide application No. 3140427 in the year 2015 for which the plaintiff has reserved its right to take appropriate action. However, despite the mark SEABIRD being registered in favour of the defendants, plaintiff is the prior registered user of the trademark STEELBIRD, its earliest registration being in the year 1972 which is much prior to the defendant‟s registration. Plaintiff thus claims injunction against the defendants from using the trademark SEABIRD as the same amounts to infringement of its registered trademark STEELBIRD beside passing off the  defendant‟s goods as that of the plaintiff‟s and causing dilution of the mark of the plaintiff.

Apotex, [2003] EWCA Civ L37, where in while granting an interim injunction, it was held that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff since it was the sole supplier of the product. New entrants to the market would be likely to cause its prices to go into a downward spiral, and Smith Kline‟s prices may not recover even if it wins eventually.

Plaintiff has placed on record documents to show that the plaintiff has a continuous, uninterrupted and voluminous use of the trademark STEELBIRD since the year 1964, particularly in relation to the helmets even prior to the year 2005.

Ltd. which decision was followed by this Court in (2011) 47 PTC 337 (Delhi) Consitex S.A. Vs. Kamini Jain & Ors. it was held:  “9. The phonetic similarity between 'Anchor' on the one hand and 'Encore', on the other, is striking. The two marks are phonetically, visually and structurally similar. The overall impression conveyed by a mark as a whole, has to be assessed in evaluating whether the mark of the Defendant is deceptively similar to the mark of the Plaintiff. Phonetic similarity constitutes an important index of whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading similarity to another. The phonetic structure indicates how the rival marks ring in the ears. Courts in a country such as ours whose culture is enriched by a diversity of languages and scripts have to consider how the rival marks are spelt and pronounced in languages in which they are commonly used. Counsel for the Defendant submits before the Court that while 'Encore' is a word of French origin, 'Anchor' is a word of English usage and the pronounciation of the two words must differ. The submission misses the point. The case before the Court is not about how an Englishman would pronounce 'Anchor' or a Frenchman would pronounce 'Encore'.  The Court must consider the usage of words in India, the manner in which a word would be written in Indian languages and last but not least, the similarity of pronounciation if the rival marks were to be pronounced in languages prevalent in the country where the marks are used. The manner in which the 'a' as in 'anchor' is pronounced by an Englishman on Notting Hill may well appear to a discerning traveller to be distinct from a Frenchman's pronounciation of the 'e' in 'encore' on a fashionable by lane near Champs Elysees. That is no defence to an action in our Courts for passing off: For the ordinary consumer in Ahmedabad and her counterpart in Mumbai's shopping streets, the 'a' in 'anchor' and the 'e' in 'encore' are perilously and deceptively similar. The Court must assess the make up of an Indian consumer and, associated with that, the cultural traits that underlie the spelling and Pronounciation of words. The case of the Plaintiff is that in Gujarati as well as in Hindi, there is not even a subtle distinction between the manner in which 'Anchor' and 'Encore' would be pronounced and we find merit in the submission. The overall impact in terms of phonetical usage is one of striking similarity. The test is not whether a customer who wishes to buy the product of the Plaintiff is likely to end up buying the product of the Defendant. The test is whether the ordinary customer is likely to be led to believe that 'Encore' is associated with the mark and the trading style of the Plaintiff. The phonetical, visual and structural get up of the two words is so strikingly similar as to lead to a likelihood of deception. The question of deception is a matter for the Court to determine, particularly at the interlocutory stage. The judgment of the Learned Single Judge has been criticized on the ground that the Court attempted to break up the words contained in the rival marks. We do not share that perception. What the Learned Single Judge has done in the present case is to compare the two rival marks and to emphasize a striking similarity between the marks with reference to the common features of the rival words. That is a permissible exercise and the judgment of the Learned Single Judge does no more than that.”",

Thus, between the two persons who are the registered owners of the trade marks, there is no exclusive right to use the said trade mark against each other, which means this provision gives concurrent right to both the persons to use the registered trade mark in their favour.

Accordingly, the latter user of the mark/name or in the business cannot misrepresent his business as that of business of the prior right holder. That is the reason why essentially the prior user is considered to be superior than that of any other rights. Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that both prior user and subsequent user are registered proprietors are irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the prior right holder/former user.

The authorities of other common law jurisdictions like England more specifically Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 14th Edn., Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell South Asian Edition recognises the principle that where trade mark action fails, passing off action may still succeed on the same evidence. This has been explained by the learned author by observing the following:  “15-033. A claimant may fail to make out a case of infringement of a trade mark for various reasons and may yet show that by imitating the mark claimed as a  trade mark, or otherwise, the defendant has done what is calculated to pass off his goods as those of the claimant.

Subject to possibly one qualification, nothing in the Trade Marks Act, 1994 affects a trader's right against another in an action for passing off. It is, therefore, no bar to an action for passing off that the trade name, get up or any other of the badges identified with the claimant's business, which are alleged to have been copies or imitated by the defendant, might have been, but are not registered as, trade marks, even though the evidence is wholly addressed to what may be a mark capable of registration. Again, it is no defence to passing off that the defendant's mark is registered. The Act offers advantages to those who register their trade marks, but imposes no penalty upon those who do not. It is equally no bar to an action for passing off that the false representation relied upon is an imitation of a trade mark that is incapable of registration. A passing off action can even lie against a registered proprietor of the mark sued upon. The fact that a claimant is using a mark registered by another party (or even the defendant) does not of itself prevent goodwill being generated by the use of the mark, or prevent such a claimant from relying on such goodwill in an action against the registered proprietor. Such unregistered marks are frequently referred to as  „common law trade marks‟.”",

Roshan Lal Duggar & Co., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50 : AIR 1978 Del 250] in the following words: (SCC OnLine Del para 10)  “10. „16. … First is the question of use of the trade mark. Use plays an all-important part. A trader acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a mark is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible character is launched upon the market. Registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater rights than what already existed at common law and at equity without registration. It does, however, facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout „the State and it established the record of facts affecting the right to the mark. Registration itself does not create a trade mark. The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute. Common law rights are left wholly unaffected.‟ [Ed.: As observed in L.D. Malhotra Industries v. Ropi Industries, 1975 SCC OnLine Del 172, para 16.] ”  (emphasis supplied)",

Even prior thereto, it was firmly established in England that a trader acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade, and that he was entitled to protect such right of property by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a court of law. Then came the English Trade Marks Act of 1875, which was substituted later by later Acts. The English Acts enabled registration of a new mark not till then used with the like consequences which a distinctive mark had prior to the passing of the Acts. The effect of the relevant provision of the English Acts was that registration of a trade mark would be deemed to be equivalent to public user of such mark. Prior to the Acts, one could become a proprietor of a trade mark only by user, but after the passing of the Act of 1875, one could become a proprietor either by user or by registering the mark even prior to its user. He could do the latter after complying with the other requirements of the Act, including the filing of a declaration of his intention to use such mark. See observations of Llyod Jacob, J. in Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In re [Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In re, (1956) 1 WLR 1 : (1955) 3 All ER 827 : 1956 RPC 1] at RPC p. 12, and particularly the following: (WLR p. 10)  „… A proprietary right in a mark sought to be registered can be obtained in a number of ways.  The mark can be originated by a person or can be acquired, but in all cases it is necessary that the person putting forward the application should be in possession of some proprietary right which, if questioned, can be substantiated.‟",

The said views emanating from the courts in India clearly speak in one voice, which is, that the rights in common law can be acquired by way of use and the registration rights were introduced later which made the rights granted under the law equivalent to the public user of such mark. Thus, we hold that registration is merely a recognition of the rights pre-existing in common law and in case of conflict between the two registered proprietors, the evaluation of the better rights in common law is essential as the common law rights would enable the court to determine whose rights between the two registered proprietors are better and superior in common law which have been recognised in the form of the registration by the Act.”",

Indisputably, the plaintiff company had office at Neb Sarai at the time of filing of the suit, so if a company has a sales office even if not a registered office, it would be difficult to dispute that plaintiff company carried on its business at that place as well. In this view of the matter support can be obtained from L'oreal Vs. Dushyant Shah, the decision of our High Court reported as MANU/DE/4389/2011. Quia Timet action is when plaintiff apprehends infringement even if defendant had not commenced operation, the right of the plaintiff to maintain cause of action on account of apprehension of infringement of its trademark is well known. In Saurav Agro' case, referred above by the plaintiff, in para 77, Pfizer products Inc. Vs. Rajesh Chopra & Ors was referred wherein also it was observed that the threat of selling the  offending goods in Delhi would confirm the jurisdiction in the court in Delhi to entertain a suit claiming an injunction in respect thereof and in so far as Order VII Rule 10 is concerned, assuming that whatever is stated in the plaint is correct, one would have to assume that the threat of the defendant to sell and offer for sale the offending goods in Delhi was also correct. Therefore, if the threat exists, then the court certainly has jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. The legal position is well settled that the question as to whether the court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain a suit or not has to be arrived at on the basis of averments made in the plaint and defence being immaterial, cannot be gone into at this stage.",

It is evident from the above observations that the interpretation given to the expression “carries on business” in the context of a defendant under section 20 of the Code has also been employed in the context of a plaintiff under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). Thus, in addition to the places where suits could be filed under section 20 of the Code, the plaintiff can also institute a suit under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957, as the case may be, by taking advantage of the provisions of section 134(2) or section 62(2), respectively. Both the latter provisions are in pari materia. Under these provisions four situations can be contemplated in the context of the plaintiff being a corporation (which includes a company). First of all, is the case where the plaintiff has a sole office.  In such a case, even if the cause of action has arisen at a different place, the plaintiff can institute a suit at the place of the sole office. Next is the case where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and a subordinate or branch office at another place and the cause of action has arisen at the place of the principal office. In such a case, the plaintiff may sue at the place of the principal office but cannot sue at the place of the subordinate office. The third case is where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and the cause of action has arisen at the place where its subordinate office is located. In this eventuality, the plaintiff would be deemed to carry on business at the place of his subordinate office and not at the place of the principal office. Thus, the plaintiff could sue at the place of the subordinate office and cannot sue (under the scheme of the provisions of section 134(2) and 62(2)) at the place of the principal office. The fourth case is where the cause of action neither arises at the place of the principal office nor at the place of the subordinate office but at some other place. In this case, the plaintiff would be deemed to carry on business at the place of its principal office and not at the place of the subordinate office. And, consequently, it could institute a suit at the place of its principal office but not at the place of its subordinate office.

                        "content": "It is settled law that while considering an application under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC, at the initial stage, statements made in the plaint are to be accepted as correct. For the purpose of deciding an application under Order VII Rule 10 of the CPC, for return of plaint on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction, it has been held that only the averments in the plaint are to be seen. In M/s. RSPL Limited  “27. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name ‘GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY’. In paragraph 37 of the plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit. But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by ‘conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name’. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the  plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Bealey [(1885) 28 Ch D 688: 54 LJ Ch 424: 52 LT 541], Mr Justice Pearson explained the law as to actions quia timet as follows:  “There are at least two necessary ingredients for a quia timet action. There must, if no actual damage is proved, be proof of imminent danger, and there must also be proof that the apprehended damage will, if it comes, be very substantial. I should almost say it must be proved that it will be irreparable, because, if the danger is not proved to be so imminent that no one can doubt that, if the remedy is delayed the damage will be suffered, I think it must be shown that, if the damage does occur at any time, it will come in such a way and under such circumstances that it will be impossible for the plaintiff to protect himself against it if relief is denied to him in a quia timet action”.”",
