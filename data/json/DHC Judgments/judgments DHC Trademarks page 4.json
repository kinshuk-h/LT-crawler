When the defendants launched DSPORT initially with the Single Star Device, after objections were raised by the plaintiffs, the logo and device were changed into a globe which was used by the defendants for their sports channel for over 18 months whereafter, they suddenly changed into EUROSPORT with a Single Star in 2017. Thus, prior to 2017, they were not in India with the Single Star logo and mere pendency of the suit would not give them any vested right to continue to use the impugned trademarks, logo and device.

Nowhere in the judgment has it been held that the exercise of such powers by the IPAB would result in the extinguishment of the right to file a suit for infringement.

The question of territoriality, as considered in Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha (supra) would be relevant while determining the conflicting rights claimed by both sides. Both, prior use and territoriality are factors that would be crucial in the action for passing off. Deception and confusion would determine equities being in whose favour, not only in a passing off action, but also in action against trademark infringement. So also would be the question of dilution of the distinctiveness of the registered trademark. But bad faith and a dishonest adoption of a registered trademark would justify an injunction to restrain a proprietor of a registered trademark from using it. If the plaintiffs were to establish a prior entry into India and a prior user of the registered trademark of the word „STAR‟ and the Single Star Device in  India and it appears that the defendants, though may be in use of a Ring of Stars or a Single Star Device in European countries, had come much later, the plaintiffs would still be entitled for an injunction for it is the reputation of each one in India that would matter, being competitors in the same field of broadcasting of sports events. Both would be vying for the same space and viewership. Use of similar trademarks could lead to the possibility or likelihood of confusion.

The plaintiffs can claim exclusivity in their own specific representation of the star, as has been held in Skyline Education Institute (India) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. SL Vaswan (2010) 2 SCC 142, Surya Agro Oils Ltd (supra) and Mercy Bigi (supra). A word that is descriptive and in common use for a particular object, by its use should immediately bring to the mind that object alone. A star to a common person would not connect to an entertainment and sports broadcasting channel. The use of a completely unconnected word and device to represent the broadcasting channels of the plaintiffs is a creative usage of the common word which requires to be  protected. It is the plaintiffs‟ case that they had coined the word „STAR‟ as an acronym for Satellite Television in Asia Region. The device was created depicting a „Star‟ in a stylized manner. The defendants have no explanation for choosing the Single Star logo, though they have one for the Ring of Stars, that is to reflect the European Union.

That the EUROSPORT was itself not a very popular channel in Europe is also evident from their own public statement made by Peter Huton on 2nd December 2015 (placed at page Nos.651-654 of the Defendant‟s documents) that the channel had not been doing well as having focused on recorded events and that a complete overhaul was being done by DISCOVERY to rebrand itself as also to add more premium events in the broadcast. This admission in 2015 though relevant for EUROSPORT would also concededly establish that they had no presence in India up to 2015 when they came in with DSPORT. By that time the plaintiffs were well entrenched in the sports and entertainment arena of the electronic media under the trademark „STAR‟ and the distinctive Star logo.",

They adopted a Single Star Device embedding it in the alphabet „D‟. Immediately, the plaintiffs protested by  issuing a legal notice dated 30th March, 2017.

In fact, in para 4 of the impugned order, the Trial Court has noted the argument with respect to the claim of the Appellants in the original ‘artistic work’ and in para 7, it is stated that the Appellants in the suit seek permanent injunction premised on passing off and infringement under Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957.

Therefore, an infringement action would lie even when the goods are dissimilar as clearly contemplated in Section 29(4) of the Act. Appellants had raised a plea under Section 29(4) of the Act and argued that the Respondent can be injuncted even in respect of totally different goods as the Appellants have huge reputation and goodwill  in their trademark for which necessary details were furnished in the plaint. The argument is noted by the Trial Court in para 10 of the impugned order and yet in the entire order, there is no discussion on the said issues.

Had the Trial Court taken into consideration this argument of the Appellants, the claim of infringement qua the footwears may have sustained in favour of the Appellants. Trial Court has also completely overlooked the arguments made by the Appellants with respect to copyright infringement and passing off. It is a settled law that infringement is a statutory right while passing off is a common law right and while the former may fail, Plaintiff may succeed in proving the latter. Appellants had set out a case of passing off based on similarity of trademarks, reputation and goodwill etc. and ought to have been dealt with by the Trial Court. However, the order reflects that no finding has been returned qua the relief of passing off. The mandate of Section 27(2) of the Act is clear that relief of passing off is uninfluenced and independent of the other provisions of the Act. It is also settled that common field of activity is not conclusive for deciding a claim based on passing off, as the real question is whether as a result of misrepresentation there is a likelihood of confusion and deception amongst the public that the goods of the Defendant emanate from the Plaintiff, resulting in consequential injury to the Plaintiff and is based on the principle that no entity or person can be permitted to sell its goods as that of the other.",

The word ‘APNA’ has been used and promoted on a large scale by the  Plaintiffs. As discussed above, the mark ‘APNA’ is the housemark of the Plaintiffs which, inter alia, provides vocational training and helps in job searches. The Plaintiffs’ business is quite extensive and the services of the Plaintiff are used by several well-established corporate entities, such as Amazon, Flipkart, Big Basket, Dunzo, Sodexo, Fortis, Mahindra, D-mart, and Future Group etc. The use of the mark ‘APNA SHARE’ would, therefore,  constitute passing off the Defendants’ business as that of the Plaintiffs’ business.",

Documents at serial nos. 10, 11, 17 and 20 and some documents at serial nos. 12, 18 and 19 would also be assumed to be in custody and possession of the Defendants, which they did not disclose while filing the written statement or even in the subsequent two applications for filing additional documents and there is not a whisper in the application which demonstrates a reasonable cause, as required under Order XI Rule 1(10) CPC.

It was urged that the embargo under Order XI Rule 1(10) CPC  is till the filing of the written statement and documents which come into existence or are executed, issued or published post the filing of the written statement ought to be taken on record, so long as they pertain to the suit and are not contrary to the pleadings. The issues have not been framed in the matter and the trial is yet to begin and, therefore, no prejudice shall be caused to the Plaintiff if the present application is allowed and this is more so, since all the additional documents have a genesis/foundation in the written statement. It is not correct for the Plaintiff to argue that the documents pertaining to a period post the filing of the written statement do not relate or are relevant to the disputes in question. Once the Defendants have laid the foundation of their goodwill, reputation and related aspects in the written statement, it is always open to bring further documents to substantiate and establish the expansion or enhancement in reputation and goodwill. With respect to the documents which were in public domain, in any case no objection can be raised, as held by this Court in CS(COMM) 1611/2016 titled as Columbia Sportswear Company v. Harish Footwear & Anr., more particularly, when even the issues have not been framed in the present case.",

Reading of sub-rule (10) of Rule 1 of Order XI shows that there is a statutory proscription on the Defendant being allowed to rely on documents which it does not disclose with the written statement/counter claim, if the same were in its power, possession, control or custody. At the same time, the Court is also proscribed from granting leave except where the Defendant shows a reasonable cause for not filing the said documents. This has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in Sudhir Kumar @ S. Baliyan (supra) albeit in the context of Order XI Rule 1(3) imposing obligations on the Plaintiff and the relevant para is as follows:  “31. Therefore a further thirty days time is provided to the plaintiff to place on record or file such additional documents in court and a declaration on oath is required to be filed by the plaintiff as was required as per Order XI Rule 1(3) if for any reasonable cause for non disclosure along with the plaint, the documents, which were in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint. Therefore plaintiff has to satisfy and establish a reasonable cause for non disclosure along with plaint. However, at the same time, the requirement of establishing the reasonable cause  for non disclosure of the documents along with the plaint shall not be applicable if it is averred and it is the case of the plaintiff that those documents have been found subsequently and in fact were not in the plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody at the time when the plaint was filed. Therefore Order XI Rule 1(4) and Order XI Rule 1(5) applicable to the commercial suit shall be applicable only with respect to the documents which were in plaintiff's power, possession, control or custody and not disclosed along with plaint. Therefore, the rigour of establishing the reasonable cause in non disclosure along with plaint may not arise in the case where the additional documents sought to be produced/relied upon are discovered subsequent to the filing of the plaint.”",

Tested on this anvil, the additional documents sought to be placed on record at serial nos. 1 to 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22, which are of the year 2021  deserve to be taken on record. Plaintiff has not taken any objection regarding relevancy of the documents at serial nos. 1 to 9, and 11, as aforementioned and in this context, I may allude to the judgment of this Court in Hassad  Food Company Q.S.C. and Another v. Bank of India and Others, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 10647, which in my view squarely applies to the present case. Relevant para of the judgment is extracted hereunder:- “18. In the pleas taken in the present application the defendants neither dispute the relevancy of the documents nor that the documents sought to be filed do not relate to them and the only objection taken is that the plaintiffs cannot be allowed to file the documents at the belated stage. As noted above in the present suit the pleadings are not complete as yet as the replications are yet to be taken on record and hence it cannot be said that the plaintiffs have filed the present application so belatedly that it cannot be allowed. Further the plaintiffs have very fairly taken the plea of administrative oversight which can occur when the number of documents is voluminous. Thus the plaintiffs have made out a reasonable cause for not filing the documents with the plaint.”",

Defendants have brought forth the data relating to transactions with their related monetary value as well as the number of downloads till the end of April, 2019. The current document seeks to expand on the said data reflecting enhanced downloads etc. only to further its stand of popularity. The objection of the Plaintiff to the said document is that the screenshot of the mobile applications and website have been filed by the Plaintiff along with its documents, which stand admitted by the Defendants in their admission/denial affidavit and no change can be permitted at this stage and is irrelevant for adjudicating the present dispute.

The objection of the Plaintiff with respect to the document is that many of these articles are of the year 2019 and yet they were not disclosed with the written statement or even in the subsequent two applications filed by the Defendants for additional documents. A perusal of  the document shows that the earliest newspaper articles sought to be produced is dated 26.08.2019 and the latest one is dated 22.07.2021. The written statement was admittedly filed on 01.07.2019 and as rightly stated by the Defendants, most of these documents were not in their possession and custody on the date of filing the written statement albeit some of them existed when the applications for additional documents were filed. No reason much less reasonable cause has been set out by the Defendants for non-disclosure of the newspaper articles filed for the period between 26.08.2019 and 15.12.2019 which are prior to the second application filed by the Defendants on 04.01.2020, for bringing on record the additional documents and in view of the judgment in Sudhir Kumar @ S.

The objection of the Plaintiff is that the document is irrelevant in adjudicating the present suit. In my view, the document can be taken on record since it is post-filing of the written statement and the changed logo may have relevance at a later stage during the trial and final arguments on some of the reliefs claimed against the Defendants. Insofar as, document at  serial no. 17, is concerned, this is a printout from the internet showing the meaning of ‘Pe’ in Hindi language. The objection raised by the Plaintiff is that the said document could have been filed earlier as it was within the knowledge of the Defendants. In my view, the objection is wholly frivolous and even otherwise, no prejudice shall be caused to the Plaintiff if a printout from Google is brought on record only to demonstrate the meaning of ‘Pe’ in Hindi language and accordingly, the document is taken on record.",

It is clear that all the documents referred to under the heading of Document 18 are for the period 1998 to 2015 and existed prior to the filing of the written statement. Plaintiff has objected to the Document on the ground that there is no reasonable cause set out for non-disclosure of the said Document at the time of filing of the written statement and this Court finds merit in the said contention. Perusal of the application shows that no reasonable cause has been set out by the Plaintiff, which is the foremost requirement of the provisions of Order XI Rule 1(10) and even, in the rejoinder, other than an evasive denial to the contention raised by the Plaintiff, no cause is brought forth. Thus, the document is not taken on record.",

In my view, these documents do not come into the rigour of explaining a reasonable cause for non-disclosure and can be taken on record and as for the legal argument raised by the Plaintiff that goodwill generated during the pendency of the suit, is concerned, the same is relevant at the stage of final argument. Document at serial no. 37 relates to commercial terms under which Defendant No. 2 agrees to provide its services to its merchants and as rightly contended by the Plaintiff, has no relevance to the disputes arising between the parties in the present suit and cannot be taken on record.",

Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sudhir Kumar @ S. Baliyan (supra). The said judgment, in my view, does not support the case of the Plaintiff and rather supports the case of the Defendants inasmuch as the Supreme Court in the said case has held that the requirement of establishing reasonable case for non-disclosure of the documents along with the plaint shall not apply if it is averred that the documents were subsequently discovered and were not in Plaintiff’s power, possession, control or custody at the time when the plaint was filed and as far as the documents which existed at the time of filing the plaint are concerned, the same can be brought on record with the leave of the Court, if reasonable cause is shown for non-disclosure.

It bears repetition to state that in the present case, Defendants have not taken inadvertence as a ground with respect to the additional documents and in any event, wherever this Court has found that Defendants have not disclosed reasonable cause for non-disclosure of the documents at the time of filing the written statement, the documents have been disallowed.",
