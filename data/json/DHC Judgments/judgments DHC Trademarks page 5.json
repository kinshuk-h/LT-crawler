The learned ADJ has held that the defendants in the suit/respondents herein would be entitled to use the trade mark ‘RTC RAMAA’, but with a label and colour combination which they have adopted for their inner packaging.

Only the marks are to be compared by the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said registration.” It was further held that “the test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound one since a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before him when he makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are remembered by general impression or by some significant detail rather than by any photographic recollection of the whole. While judging the question as to whether the defendant has  infringed the trade mark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public and not by merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.”",

This was answered in the negative. However, in the present case, the misuser alleged is at best of the registered stylised version and not of the mark ‘RAMU’. The said judgment therefore, cannot have any application to the facts of the present case.

As held by the Supreme Court in Laxmikant Patel (supra), a refusal to grant an injunction in spite of the availability of facts, which are prima facie established by overwhelming evidence and material available on record justifying the grant thereof, occasions a failure of justice and such injury to the plaintiff as would not be capable of being undone at a later stage; it, therefore, becomes obligatory on the part of the Appellate Court to interfere.",

Further, the petitioner has been unable to show the proprietary rights of M/s Ma Gayatri in the mark •VEGA•. The only stray document relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in this regard is the NOC issued by the DCGI on 23.07.2001. The said document does not bear any reference to a trade mark . The learned counsel claims that the said NOC was granted on an application filed by M/s Swiss Pharma Pvt. Ltd., which in turn depicts the mark •VEGA-100•. However, the connection between the two documents cannot be established. Even otherwise, as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, these documents do not show the user of the mark on the actual product. The judgment in M/s Kisan Industries (supra), therefore, cannot come to the aid of the petitioner, as in the present case, there is neither an assignment of the mark by M/s Ma Gayatri in favour of the petitioner, nor the prior use of the mark •VEGA• by M/s Ma Gayatri has been established by the petitioner. In fact, the judgment of Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd. (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner, works against the petitioner itself, as  the petitioner has not placed any credible evidence of proof of the use of the mark by M/s Ma Gayatri.",

This is a finding of fact by the learned IPAB. In exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, such finding of fact cannot be interfered with by a court by re-appreciating evidence and coming to its own conclusion. The jurisdiction of this Court can be exercised only where such findings are found to be completely perverse or un-substantiated by any evidence on record. This Court does not sit as a Court of Appeal against the order of learned IPAB, so as to re-appreciate the evidence on merit. In this regard, reference can be made to the judgement passed by this Court in U.V.  Enterprises v. New Bharat Rice Mills, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3645, wherein it was observed that:  \"12... One may only remind oneself that the court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is not acting as an appellate court and, therefore, findings of fact reached by tribunals, as a result of appreciation of evidence cannot be re-opened or questioned in writ proceedings unless it is a case of no evidence or a case where a tribunal has erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence or, has erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which, propelled it to come to the impugned finding. Apart from these errors, findings of fact arrived at by an inferior court or tribunal cannot be reopened. The other exceptions where the superior courts exercising writ jurisdiction can interfere are cases  where principles of natural justice are breached or a subordinate Court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or exercises jurisdiction with material irregularity. Therefore, it is often said that a writ court is concerned with the decision making process and not the decision itself.\"",

The defendants is offering  to sell and are distributing and supplying their impugned goods bearing the impugned mark to the dealers and distributors in the markets of inter alia Shahdara District i.e. in Shahdara, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, GTB Enclave, Farsh Bazar, Harsh Vihar, Nand Nagari, Jyoti Nagar, Welcome, Jagat Puri, Jafrabad, Madhu Vihar, Seemapuri, M.S.

Further, the defendants have all the intention to sell the products in the market. Hence, a part of cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court thereby this Hon•ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try and adjudicate the present suit under Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendants offers, advertise, and sell their impugned products within the jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court and the wrong is done within the local limits of this Hon•ble Court and therefore, this Hon•ble Court also has jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit under the provision of Section 19 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This Hon•ble Court thus has the jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the suit. Further, The plaintiff is having their distributor and stockiest in Shahdara District and are selling the goods under the trademark DEVARPAN in Shahdara, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, GTB Enclave, Farsh Bazar, Harsh Vihar, Nand Nagari, Jyoti Nagar, Welcome, Jagat Puri, Jafrabad, Madhu Vihar, Seemapuri, M.S.

Thus, this Hon•ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try the present suit under Section 19, 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under Section 62 (2)) of the Copyright Act, 1957 as the plaintiff is carrying on the business within the jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court.

Coming back to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name •GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY•. In paragraph 37 of the plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit. But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by •conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name•. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's  goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court  by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.•  (underlined for emphasis)",

Vide the said order, the extension of time  sought by the Appellant for taking the evidence on record under Rule 50(3) of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002, (hereinafter ‘2002 Rules’), after delay in service of evidence to the Applicant, was rejected and in effect the opposition has been deemed to have been abandoned under Rule 50(2) of 2002 Rules.",

As per Section 21(1) of the Act, the time limit for opposing a trademark which is advertised is clearly prescribed as four months from the date of advertisement. As per Section 21(2) of the Act, upon the statement of opposition being served to the Applicant, the counter-statement has to be filed within two months from the receipt of the notice of opposition.",

                        "content": "Section 21 of the Act contemplates filing of evidence by the Opponent and the Applicant. However, time limits for filing of evidence are not prescribed in the Act and the same are laid down in the Rules. Rule 45 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2017 (hereinafter ‘2017 Rules’), which are currently in place, requires the Opponent to file evidence by way of affidavit within two months from the service of the copy of the counter-statement. The position under Rule 50 of the erstwhile 2002 Rules was that apart from the two-month period, an extension of one month could be granted by the Registrar if the same was sought under Form TM -56 in terms of Rule 50(3) of the 2002 Rules. The corresponding provision in 2017 Rules, i.e., Rule 45, however, has omitted the one-month extension period. As per Rule 46 of the 2017 Rules, evidence has to be adduced by the Applicant within two months of the receipt of the evidence of the Opponent. Under Rule 47 of the 2017  Rules, within one month, the evidence in reply has to be filed by the Opponent. Under Rule 48 of the 2017 Rules, further evidence can be entertained if leave is sought by either of the parties. This is usually done, as per the practice of Registrar of Trademarks, by filing of an Interlocutory Petition (I.P.). The time period for filing pleadings and evidence in opposition proceedings is therefore as under:  Notice of Opposition to Registration -Four months [Section 21(1) of the Act] Counter-statement-Two months [Section 21(2) of the Act] Evidence in support of Opposition -Two months [Section 21(4) of the Act r/w Rule 45(1) of the 2017 Rules] Evidence in support of Application-Two months [Section 21(4) of the Act r/w Rule 46(1) of the 2017 Rules]  Evidence in Reply by the Opponent-One month  [Section 21(4) of the Act r/w Rule 47 of the 2017 Rules]",

Evidence was filed by the Opponent with the Trade Marks Registry on 10th August, 2007. The error / lapse on behalf of the Opponent was that before filing the hard copy of the evidence in support of the opposition in the Trademark Registry, a copy of the same was not served on the Applicant within the prescribed time. The same was only served by courier sent on 14th  August, 2007 and received by the Applicant on 16th August, 2007. So, at best, there was a delay of a couple of days in the service of the evidence upon the Applicant, though the same was filed with the Trade Mark Registry within the timeline prescribed.",
