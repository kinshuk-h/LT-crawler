(3)  Where the Registrar finds nothing in the particulars of an international registration to refuse grant of protection under sub-section (2), he shall within the prescribed period cause such international registration to be advertised in the prescribed manner.  (4)  The provisions of sections 9 to 21 (both inclusive), 63 and 74 shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to an international registration as if such international registration was an application for registration of a trade mark under section 18.

The relevant provisions of the Madrid Protocol so far as are relevant to the present Petitions, are reproduced hereinbelow:- “Article 4  Effects of International Registration  (1)  (a) From the date of the registration or recordal effected in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 3ter, the protection of the mark in each of the Contracting Parties concerned shall be the same as if the mark had been deposited direct with the Office of that Contracting Party. If no refusal has been notified to the International Bureau in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) or if a refusal notified in accordance with the said Article has been withdrawn subsequently, the protection of the mark in the Contracting Party concerned shall, as from the said date, be the same as if the mark had been registered by the Office of that Contracting Party.  (b)  The indication of classes of goods and services provided for in Article 3 shall not bind the Contracting Parties with regard to the determination of the scope of the protection of the mark.  (2)  Every international registration shall enjoy the right of priority provided for by Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, without it being necessary to  comply with the formalities prescribed in Section D of that Article.  Article 4bis  Replacement of a National or Regional Registration by an International Registration  (1)  Where a mark that is the subject of a national or regional registration in the Office of a Contracting Party is also the subject of an international registration and both registrations stand in the name of the same person, the international registration is deemed to replace the national or regional registration, without prejudice to any rights acquired by virtue of the latter, provided that  (i)  the protection resulting from the international registration extends to the said Contracting Party under Article 3ter(1) or (2),  (ii)  all the goods and services listed in the national or regional registration are also listed in the international registration in respect of the said Contracting Party,  (iii)  such extension takes effect after the date of the national or regional registration.  (2)  The Office referred to in paragraph (1) shall, upon request, be required to take note in its register of the international registration.  Article 5  Refusal and Invalidation of Effects of International Registration in Respect of Certain Contracting Parties  (1)  Where the applicable legislation so authorizes, any Office of a Contracting Party which has been notified by the International Bureau of an extension to that Contracting Party, under Article 3ter(1) or (2), of the protection resulting from the international registration shall have the right to declare in a notification of refusal that protection cannot be granted in the  said Contracting Party to the mark which is the subject of such extension. Any such refusal can be based only on the grounds which would apply, under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in the case of a mark deposited direct with the Office which notifies the refusal. However, protection may not be refused, even partially, by reason only that the applicable legislation would permit registration only in a limited number of classes or for a limited number of goods or services.  (2)     (a) Any Office wishing to exercise such right shall notify its refusal to the International Bureau, together with a statement of all grounds, within the period prescribed by the law applicable to that Office and at the latest, subject to subparagraphs (b) and (c), before the expiry of one year from the date on which the notification of the extension referred to in paragraph (1) has been sent to that Office by the International Bureau.  (b)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any Contracting Party may declare that, for international registrations made under this Protocol, the time limit of one year referred to in subparagraph (a) is replaced by 18 months.  (c)  Such declaration may also specify that, when a refusal of protection may result from an opposition to the granting of protection, such refusal may be notified by the Office of the said Contracting Party to the International Bureau after the expiry of the 18 month time limit. Such an Office may, with respect to any given international registration, notify a refusal of protection after the expiry of the 18-month time limit, but only if  (i)  it has, before the expiry of the 18-month time limit, informed the International Bureau of the possibility that oppositions may  be filed after the expiry of the 18-month time limit and  (ii) the notification of the refusal based on an opposition is made within a time limit of one month from the expiry of the opposition period and, in any case, not later than seven months from the date on which the opposition period begins.  (d)  Any declaration under subparagraphs (b) or (c) may be made in the instruments referred to in Article 14(2), and the effective date of the declaration shall be the same as the date of entry into force of this Protocol with respect to the State or intergovernmental organization having made the declaration. Any such declaration may also be made later, in which case the declaration shall have effect three months after its receipt by the Director General of the Organization (hereinafter referred to as \"the Director General\"), or at any later date indicated in the declaration, in respect of any international registration whose date is the same as or is later than the effective date of the declaration.  (e)  Upon the expiry of a period of ten years from the entry into force of this Protocol, the Assembly shall examine the operation of the system established by subparagraphs (a) to (d). Thereafter, the provisions of the said subparagraphs may be modified by a unanimous decision of the Assembly.  (3)  The International Bureau shall, without delay, transmit one of the copies of the notification of refusal to the holder of the international registration. The said holder shall have the same remedies as if the mark had been deposited by him direct with the Office which has notified its refusal. Where the International Bureau has received information under paragraph (2)(c)(i), it shall, without delay, transmit the said information to the holder of the international registration.  (4)  The grounds for refusing a mark shall be communicated by the International Bureau to any interested party who may so request.  (5)  Any Office which has not notified, with respect to a given international registration, any provisional or final refusal to the International Bureau in accordance with paragraphs (1) and  (2)  shall, with respect to that international registration, lose the benefit of the right provided for in paragraph (1).  (6)  Invalidation, by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party, of the effects, in the territory of that Contracting Party, of an international registration may not be pronounced without the holder of such international registration having, in good time, been afforded the opportunity of defending his rights. Invalidation shall be notified to the International Bureau.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Article 4(1)(a) and 5(5) further states that failure of the office of the Contracting Party to notify its provisional or final „refusal‟ to a given international registration shall result in such Contracting Party losing its right to such refusal and the protection of the mark in question shall extend to such Contracting Party.",

While in Madrid Protocol, it is failure to communicate „refusal‟ within the time prescribed, which shall result in deemed extension of protection to the Trade Mark, in Section 36E(5) of the Act, it is the failure to convey „acceptance‟ that leads to such deeming extension of protection.",

Now, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 36, p. 414, there is a presumption that Parliament does not assert or assume jurisdiction which goes beyond the limits established by the common consent of nations and statutes are to be interpreted provided that their language permits, so as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations or with the established principles of International law.

In this country, as is the case in England, the treaty or International Protocol or convention does not become effective or operative of its own force as in some of the continental countries unless domestic legislation has been introduced to attain a specified result. Once, Parliament has legislated, the Court must first look at the legislation and construe the language employed in it. If the terms of the legislative enactment do not suffer from any ambiguity or lack of clarity they must be given effect to even if they do not carry out the treaty obligations. But the treaty or the Protocol or the convention becomes important if the meaning of the expressions used by the Parliament is not clear and can be construed in more than one way. The reason is that if one of the meanings which can be properly ascribed is in consonance with the treaty obligations and the other meaning is not so consonant, the meaning which is consonant is to be preferred. Even where an Act had been passed to give effect to the convention which was scheduled to it, the words employed in the Act had to be interpreted in the well-established sense which they had in municipal law.

This Court finds merit in the contention of the Plaintiffs that Defendant No. 1 by using the trademarks „INDIABULLS‟, „DHANI‟ and  (device), which are identical to the Plaintiffs‟ registered trademarks as well as by creating and operating the impugned domain name www.indiabullsdhanifinance.co, which is deceptively similar to Plaintiffs‟ domain names www.indianbulls.com and www.indiabullsdhani.com, is infringing the statutory rights of the Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1, under the aforesaid trademarks is providing services relating to financial transactions, personal loans etc., which are similar to those of the Plaintiffs and the consumer base is also the same.

In this behalf, learned Counsel has relied upon the judgments of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited v. Selection Footwear, 1999 PTC (19) 578; Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances, 1999 PTC (19) 685; and CS (OS) 2711/1999, L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co., 123 (2005) DLT 503 decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs. 3 lakh were awarded in favour of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, 125 (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the Court and they should not be permitted to enjoy  the benefits of evasion of Court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appear in Court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the Court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavour should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.",

If punitive damages are not awarded in such cases, it would only encourage unscrupulous persons who actuated by dishonest intention, use the well-reputed trademark of another person, so as to encash on the goodwill and reputation which that mark enjoys in the market, with impunity, and then avoid payment of damages by remaining absent from the Court, thereby depriving the plaintiff an opportunity to establish actual profit earned by him from use of the infringing mark, which can be computed  only on the basis of his account books.

It is found that due to certain administrative and technical reasons the present Notice of Opposition could not be communicated to the WIPO m the form of Provisional Refusal based on opposition within the period of 18 months from the date of notification of the international registration. In such circumstances the present IRDI is deemed protected in India.  It is therefore ordered that status of the present IRDI should be changed as PROTECTION GRANTED and the present opposition will therefore abate.”",

(3)  Where the Registrar finds nothing in the particulars of an international registration to refuse grant of protection under sub-section (2), he shall within the prescribed period cause such international registration to be advertised in the prescribed manner.

The relevant provisions of the Madrid Protocol so far as are relevant to the present Petitions, are reproduced hereinbelow:- “Article 4  Effects of International Registration  (1)  (a) From the date of the registration or recordal effected in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 3ter, the protection of the mark in each of the Contracting Parties concerned shall be the same as if the mark had been deposited direct with the Office of that Contracting Party. If no refusal has been notified to the International Bureau in accordance with Article 5(1) and (2) or if a refusal notified in accordance with the said Article has been withdrawn subsequently, the protection of the mark in the Contracting Party concerned shall, as from the said date, be the same as if the mark had been registered by the Office of that Contracting Party.  (b)  The indication of classes of goods and services provided for in Article 3 shall not bind the Contracting Parties with regard to the determination of the scope of the protection of the mark.  (2)  Every international registration shall enjoy the right of priority provided for by Article 4 of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, without it being necessary to  comply with the formalities prescribed in Section D of that Article.  Article 4bis  Replacement of a National or Regional Registration by an International Registration  (1)  Where a mark that is the subject of a national or regional registration in the Office of a Contracting Party is also the subject of an international registration and both registrations stand in the name of the same person, the international registration is deemed to replace the national or regional registration, without prejudice to any rights acquired by virtue of the latter, provided that  (i)  the protection resulting from the international registration extends to the said Contracting Party under Article 3ter(1) or (2),  (ii)  all the goods and services listed in the national or regional registration are also listed in the international registration in respect of the said Contracting Party,  (iii)  such extension takes effect after the date of the national or regional registration.  (2)  The Office referred to in paragraph (1) shall, upon request, be required to take note in its register of the international registration.  Article 5  Refusal and Invalidation of Effects of International Registration in Respect of Certain Contracting Parties  (1)  Where the applicable legislation so authorizes, any Office of a Contracting Party which has been notified by the International Bureau of an extension to that Contracting Party, under Article 3ter(1) or (2), of the protection resulting from the international registration shall have the right to declare in a notification of refusal that protection cannot be granted in the  said Contracting Party to the mark which is the subject of such extension. Any such refusal can be based only on the grounds which would apply, under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in the case of a mark deposited direct with the Office which notifies the refusal. However, protection may not be refused, even partially, by reason only that the applicable legislation would permit registration only in a limited number of classes or for a limited number of goods or services.  (2)     (a) Any Office wishing to exercise such right shall notify its refusal to the International Bureau, together with a statement of all grounds, within the period prescribed by the law applicable to that Office and at the latest, subject to subparagraphs (b) and (c), before the expiry of one year from the date on which the notification of the extension referred to in paragraph (1) has been sent to that Office by the International Bureau.  (b)  Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any Contracting Party may declare that, for international registrations made under this Protocol, the time limit of one year referred to in subparagraph (a) is replaced by 18 months.  (c)  Such declaration may also specify that, when a refusal of protection may result from an opposition to the granting of protection, such refusal may be notified by the Office of the said Contracting Party to the International Bureau after the expiry of the 18 month time limit. Such an Office may, with respect to any given international registration, notify a refusal of protection after the expiry of the 18-month time limit, but only if  (i)  it has, before the expiry of the 18-month time limit, informed the International Bureau of the possibility that oppositions may  be filed after the expiry of the 18-month time limit and  (ii) the notification of the refusal based on an opposition is made within a time limit of one month from the expiry of the opposition period and, in any case, not later than seven months from the date on which the opposition period begins.  (d)  Any declaration under subparagraphs (b) or (c) may be made in the instruments referred to in Article 14(2), and the effective date of the declaration shall be the same as the date of entry into force of this Protocol with respect to the State or intergovernmental organization having made the declaration. Any such declaration may also be made later, in which case the declaration shall have effect three months after its receipt by the Director General of the Organization (hereinafter referred to as \"the Director General\"), or at any later date indicated in the declaration, in respect of any international registration whose date is the same as or is later than the effective date of the declaration.  (e)  Upon the expiry of a period of ten years from the entry into force of this Protocol, the Assembly shall examine the operation of the system established by subparagraphs (a) to (d). Thereafter, the provisions of the said subparagraphs may be modified by a unanimous decision of the Assembly.  (3)  The International Bureau shall, without delay, transmit one of the copies of the notification of refusal to the holder of the international registration. The said holder shall have the same remedies as if the mark had been deposited by him direct with the Office which has notified its refusal. Where the International Bureau has received information under paragraph (2)(c)(i), it shall, without delay, transmit the said information to the holder of the international registration.  (4)  The grounds for refusing a mark shall be communicated by the International Bureau to any interested party who may so request.  (5)  Any Office which has not notified, with respect to a given international registration, any provisional or final refusal to the International Bureau in accordance with paragraphs (1) and  (2)  shall, with respect to that international registration, lose the benefit of the right provided for in paragraph (1).  (6)  Invalidation, by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party, of the effects, in the territory of that Contracting Party, of an international registration may not be pronounced without the holder of such international registration having, in good time, been afforded the opportunity of defending his rights. Invalidation shall be notified to the International Bureau.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Any office of the Contracting Party wishing to exercise such right as to notify its „refusal‟ to the International Bureau, together with the statement of all grounds and within the period, which in the present case as far as India is concerned is eighteen months, shall do so as prescribed by the law applicable to that office. Sub-clause C of Article 5(2) of the Madrid Protocol further provides that a declaration of „refusal‟ may also result from an opposition to the granting of such protection, in which event such „refusal‟ may be notified to the International Bureau after an expiry of the time limit of eighteen months. Article 4(1)(a) and 5(5) further states that failure of the office of the Contracting Party to notify its provisional or final „refusal‟ to a given international registration shall result in such Contracting Party losing its right to such refusal and the protection of the mark in question shall extend to such Contracting Party.",

There is a marked difference in the language used in Article 5 of the Madrid Protocol, as reproduced hereinabove, and Section 36E(5) of the Act. Unlike the Madrid Protocol, where the Trade Mark office of the Contracting State is to communicate  its „refusal‟ to register the trade mark to the International Bureau, in Section 36E(5) of the Act, the Trade Mark Office of India is to communicate its „acceptance‟ to such International application. While in Madrid Protocol, it is failure to communicate „refusal‟ within the time prescribed, which shall result in deemed extension of protection to the Trade Mark, in Section 36E(5) of the Act, it is the failure to convey „acceptance‟ that leads to such deeming extension of protection.",

If the statutory enactment is clear and unambiguous, it must be construed according to its meaning even though it is contrary to the Treaty to which India is a signatory. In M/s. V.O. Tractoroexport, Moscow v. M/s. Tarapore & Company And Another, (1969) 3 SCC 562, the Supreme Court explained this principle as under:  “15. Now, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 36, p. 414, there is a presumption that Parliament does not assert or assume jurisdiction which goes beyond the limits established by the common consent of nations and statutes are to be interpreted provided that their language permits, so as not to be inconsistent with the comity of nations or with the established principles of International law. But this principle applies only where there is an ambiguity and must give way before a clearly expressed intention. If statutory enactments are clear in meaning, they must be construed according to their meaning even though they are contrary to the comity of nations or International law.",

                        "content": "We may look at another well-recognized principle. In this country, as is the case in England, the treaty or International Protocol or convention does not become effective or operative of its own force as in some of the continental countries unless domestic legislation has been introduced to attain a specified result. Once, Parliament has legislated, the Court must first look at the legislation and construe the language employed in it. If the terms of the legislative enactment do not suffer from any ambiguity or lack of clarity they must be given effect to even if they do not carry out the treaty obligations. But the treaty or the Protocol or the convention becomes important if the meaning of the expressions used by the Parliament is not clear and can be construed in more than one way. The reason is that if one of the meanings which can be properly ascribed is in consonance with the treaty obligations and the other meaning is not so consonant, the meaning which is consonant is to be preferred. Even where an Act had been passed to give effect to the convention which was scheduled to it, the words employed in the Act had to be interpreted in the well-established sense which they had in municipal law.

The relevant paragraphs of the said letter are extracted herein below:  “5. My client states that they are in right to use the alleged design/marks as shown in your letter, in the absence of your supportive documents that such design/marks were used earlier as trade marks by your client. However, as they have now come to know about the products/trade mark rights of your client and as they are a unit of very small means and as they prefer to disassociate with the confrontation with a giant organisation like your client, they have initiate steps to amend suitably the name of the their unit and the consequent short name for their product and the same will be effected in due course after complying with the registration formalities in this regard. Hence, my client would like to convey that you/your client may deter from further process in this regard and please be informed accordingly.”",

Defendant is the prior user of the mark since the year 2007 however since the use of the mark by the defendant is intermittent and not voluminous so as to establish the defence under Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act. However, the plaintiff would still not be entitled to the relief of injunction for the reason the mark “NO TURN” is a descriptive mark.

Mr. Mehta sought to place reliance on the observation, in this decision, that that the defendant was estopped from contending that the plaintiff's mark was generic or descriptive, as it had applied for registration of a similar mark. There are two reasons why this observation, though it unquestionably finds place in the judgement, cannot help Mr. Mehta's client. Firstly, even if the defendant were to be estopped taking such a defence, the Court, adjudicating the claim of infringement, cannot ignore either Section 9(1)(b) (which prohibits registration of descriptive trade marks) or 30(2)(a) (which postulates that there can be no infringement of a descriptive trade mark), which are in the nature of statutory interdictions. Secondly, the defendant, in the present case, has applied for registration of the entire ‘BharatPe’ mark, and not merely of the suffix ‘Pe’. No plea of estoppel can, therefore, inhibit the defendant from contending that the suffix ‘Pe’ is generic and descriptive in nature.” (emphasis supplied)",

This wholesome doctrine, the learned Judge held, applies not only to successive stages of the same suit, but also to another suit than the one in which the position was taken up, provided the second suit grows out of the judgment in the first.” (Emphasis Supplied)  Applying the said principles of law to the present case, it is apparent that if the defendant is allowed to re-agitate, it would also lead to allowing the party to approbate and reprobate at the same time which is clearly impermissible.

The fact that the defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary right and monopoly in “DIMMER DOT”, it does not lie in their mouth to say that the word “DIMMER” is a generic expression. User of the word “DIMMER” by others cannot be a defence available to the defendants, if it could be shown that the same is being used in violation of the statutory right of the plaintiff.

Reference may also be made to the decision in P.M. Diesels Ltd. v. S.M. Diesels, 53 (1994) Delhi Law Times 742. It was held in those decision that if the plaintiff is a proprietor of the registered trade mark, the same gives to the proprietor of the registered trade mark the exclusive right to use the trade mark with relation to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered under the provisions of Section 28 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. It was also held that such statutory right cannot be lost merely on the question of principles of delay, laches or acquiescence. It was also held that in general mere delay after knowledge of infringement does not deprive the registered proprietor of a trade mark of his statutory rights or of the appropriate remedy for the enforcement of those rights so long as the said delay is not an inordinate delay.

We are unable to concur with the said view.  Section 9(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 sets out the grounds on which the Registrar may refuse registration of a trademark.

By virtue of Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 the original registration of the trademark is prima facie evidence of the validity thereof.",

We have weighed the rival contentions aforesaid and do not find any merit in this appeal for the following reasons:  (xvi) There is a difference between words/marks which would classify as descriptive, generally of the goods or services, whosoever may be provider thereof and words/marks which communicate the particular/peculiar quality/qualities or  features of product of one and which may not exist or do not exist in the same product being provided by others. In our opinion, it is only the former which are not registrable as trademark and which are not protected, and not the latter. The words “marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purposes, values…of the goods” in Section 9(1)(b) cannot be read to include words/marks which designate the quality, intended purpose or values, not generic to the goods and services but unique to the goods of one and which may not be present in the same goods and services provided by another. Such words/marks, highlight and communicate to the consumer the difference claimed from the same goods or services of others, also available in the market. of course, such words or marks would also be, in a sense descriptive of those unique features, quality, character, intended purpose of goods/services of one; however they will still classify as distinctive so long as none other till then has described those as unique to the product.  (xxii) As far as the reliance on Marico Limited (supra) is concerned, the decision of the Division Bench therein turned on the finding of the trade mark “LOW-ABSORB” being descriptive of the product in that case. We have herein above held that the words “ALLROUND PROTECTION” in relation to the product with which this case is concerned are not descriptive generally of toothpastes, by whosoever manufactured/supplied but show the  peculiar quality, features/advantages in the product of the respondent/plaintiff which may not be present in the same product of others.",

This principle has also been expounded by the Supreme Court.7 In S.

The relevant portion of the said judgment is extracted below:  •30.1. From the reading of Section 27(2) of the Act, it is clear that the right of action of any person for passing off the goods/services of another person and remedies thereof are not affected by the provisions of the Act.

Conjoint reading of Sections 34, 27 and 28 would show that the rights of registration are subject to Section 34 which can be seen from the opening words of Section 28 of the Act which states •Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor....• and also the opening words of Section 34 which states •Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere...• Thus, the scheme of the Act is such where rights of prior user are recognised superior than that of the registration and even the registered proprietor cannot disturb/interfere with the rights of prior user. The overall effect of collective reading of the provisions of the Act is that the action for passing off which is premised on the rights of prior user generating a goodwill shall be unaffected by any registration provided under the Act. This proposition has been discussed in extenso in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn. [N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn., 1995 SCC OnLine Del 310 : AIR 1995 Del 300] wherein the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court recognised that the registration is not an indefeasible right and the same is subject to rights of prior user. The said decision of Whirlpool [N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn., 1995 SCC OnLine Del 310 : AIR 1995 Del 300] was further affirmed by the Supreme Court of India in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn. [N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn., (1996) 5 SCC 714] 30.5.

However, if the objection of invalidity is raised by the opposing party, a subsisting trademark registration does not preclude the Court from forming a prima facie view on the objection, even at the interlocutory stage. In this regard, it would be pertinent to note that Division Bench of this Court in Marico Limited v. Agro Food Limited, 8 while examining the interplay between Sections 28, 31 and 124 of the Act, held that it would be permissible for Courts to prima facie examine validity of registration for the purposes of deciding interlocutory applications. Further, the Bombay High Court in Lupin Ltd. v.

Ltd. and CCL International Ltd. (contractual partner of Shamrock Geoscience Pvt.

Ltd. was engaged in import, marketing, selling and manufacturing of •InfraCrete• products, and not •GeoCrete• products. That apart, TIMAB also raised certain objections qua the use •InfraCrete• mark by SHAMROCK. It was submitted that use of •InfraCrete• mark is questionable considering the letter issued by one InfraCrete GmbH to CCL International Ltd. in 2013, stating that till date, no InfraCrete products have been supplied by it in India. It has further been pointed out that it was only after the afore-said communication that Mr. Korytowski adopted and commenced usage of the •EvoCrete• mark.

The German Appellate Court vide order dated 16th October, 2009 in an appeal by SHAMROCK (Defendants therein), made following observations (as per translated copy) qua the Supply Contract and Supply License Agreement:  •The defendants cannot rely on the conclusion of the •delivery contract for soil solidification additives• concluded between the applicant and the defendant for 1st and 2nd /18.7.2007 (Appendix Ast 5) the use of the trademark •GeoCrete• is permitted and therefore does not use the domain names in question within the meaning of Art. 9 para. 1 sentence 2 of GMV would use •without consent•. Although it is true that, according to S 3 of the contract, the applicant is obliged to manufacture, deliver to the products •GeoCrete ST• and •GeoCrete IM• for the defendants to 1st and 2nd and to label the products in accordance with S 9 with the trademark •GeoCrete,• the applicant owns in accordance with Contract only the distribution rights for the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as well as Equatorial Guinea, otherwise distribution will take place via the defendant to 2. It can be deduced from this by interpretation (SS 133, 157 BGB) that the defendants should be entitled to distribute the contract products produced and delivered by the applicant under the trademark •GeoCrete! To market. In fact, however, the defendants no longer have the products manufactured by the applicant due to disputes since 2008.  xx  • xx  • xx  For the same reason, the defendants cannot rely on the supply agreement between the applicant and the defendant for the 2nd delivery agreement concluded on August 12, 2005 (Appendix VB 9). Even under this contract, the defendant should be solely obliged and entitled to use the name •GeoCrete• when selling her products manufactured using the special binders manufactured by the applicant. Such products are no longer undisputedly distributed by the applicants. In this context, therefore, it is not necessary to decide whether the contract of 12.8.2005 with a view to the subsequent agreement of July 18, 2007 (Appendix Ast 5) still exists at all.•  [Emphasis Supplied]",

A prima facie analysis of the documents relied upon depicts that SHAMROCK•s claims of use/prior use of the impugned mark in India is not supported by any credible material; SHAMROCK has failed to prove the adoption and use of the •proposed to be used• mark in India. Neither has there been actual sale of goods to which the impugned mark is applied, nor any proof of non-sales activities such as promotion/ advertisement of the impugned mark has been shown. The documents referred above demonstrate that the limited use of the impugned mark by SHAMROCK was consequent to express authorisation or licensing by TIMAB, and not vice versa. SHAMROCK had no independent right to use the impugned mark which belongs to TIMAB. Mere registration of a mark by the Trade Mark Registry does not prove its use by the proprietor in whose name the said mark was registered. Due to lack of documentary proof and inability of SHAMROCK to sustain its claim of use in India, its registration of the impugned mark and the rights flowing therefrom become subservient to superior rights of prior user i.e., TIMAB, which are discussed in later segments of this judgement. The Court is unable to agree that SHAMROCK has been sufficiently using the impugned mark in India entitling it to seek an injunction against TIMAB. It has also not demonstrated any claim of passing off against TIMAB, which would entitle it to an injunction on the basis of common law rights.",

In the opinion of the Court, Mr. Chandra•s contention is incorrect. The orders of the Courts in Germany cannot be brushed aside lightly. The Courts in Germany have examined and interpreted the contracts, contrary to Mr. Chandra•s assertion. At this interim stage, the view taken by the Courts in Germany relating to the impugned mark on the basis of contractual rights arising from agreements, which were also cited before this Court, is therefore certainly persuasive. It is not disputed by SHAMROCK that it does not have any manufacturing facility in India and the goods are being imported from Germany, where presently, in terms of order passed by Courts in Germany, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark. On a pointed query of the Court, Mr. Chandra conceded that, at the place of origin of the goods, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark on the goods.

As discussed before, TIMAB has been catering to innumerable customers worldwide and also in India. It has undertaken several construction projects in collaboration with State Governments, besides sale of GeoCrete products for private use for customers, and has considerable reputation and goodwill in as much as it has been invited to participate in conferences and similar events as proprietor of the impugned mark. By virtue of various agreements entered into between the parties, TIMAB has been continuously identified as the source for •GeoCrete• products by the public.",

Considering its attempts to unfairly preclude TIMAB from obtaining registration in India despite previous knowledge of TIMAB•s registrations in various jurisdictions coupled with numerous transactions between parties facilitated by way of multiple agreements, it is incomprehensible as to how SHAMROCK legitimately obtained registration in India. On the other hand, TIMAB has been able to sufficiently demonstrate that it has used the impugned mark in India much prior in time.",

No.  7757/2021  in CS (COMM.) 308/2021. The documents so relied upon by it are either misleading or pertain to the use of a different mark. The facts analysed above demonstrate that TIMAB has extensively used and promoted the impugned mark since its adoption, and has since created a huge market and global reputation for •GeoCrete• products, which has spilled over in to India. The documents placed on record, analysed above, demonstrate that the goodwill and reputation in respect to the impugned mark is now associated exclusively with TIMAB by the members of the industry and trade, consumers, retailers, and public at large. Allowing any other party to use an identical mark is likely to cause confusion.  18 [1990] 1 All ER 873.  19 See: S. Syed Mohideen (supra); Laxmikant V. Patel v.
