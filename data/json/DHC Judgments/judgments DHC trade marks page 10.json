                        "content": "This Court finds merit in the contention of the Plaintiffs that Defendant No. 1 by using the trademarks ‘INDIABULLS’, ‘DHANI’ and  www.dhanifinance.in (device), which are identical to the Plaintiffs’ registered trademarks as well as by creating and operating the impugned domain name , which is deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs’ domain name, is infringing the statutory rights of the Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1, under the aforesaid trademarks is providing services relating to financial transactions, personal loans etc., which are similar to those of the Plaintiffs and the consumer base is also the same. Therefore, in my view, the triple identity test of identical/deceptively similar trademarks, identical services and trade channels stands satisfied and use of the impugned trademarks/domain name by Defendant No. 1 constitutes infringement of the Plaintiffs’ registered trademarks. The Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit  Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965  SC 980 has held that once there is imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the Plaintiffs’ rights are violated. Relevant passage from the said judgment is as under:  “28. ……..  While an action for passing off is a common law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of “the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods” (vide Section 21 of the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.”",

In order to determine whether the plaintiffs have established the ingredients for successfully bringing an action for passing off it will be appropriate to advert to the broad principles of the law of passing off. In ‘Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names’-Supplement-pages 42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated thus:  The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general proposition-no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number.  Firstly, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying ‘getup’ (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services.  Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the  defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to belief that the goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.  Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quick time action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or service is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.  xxx  xxx xxx",

Plaintiffs have been continuously and extensively using the trademarks for their financial services, which is evident from the combined revenue of over Rs.14,640 crores as on 31.03.2019 of Plaintiff No. 1 and over Rs.1650 crores as on 31.03.2019 in respect of Plaintiff No. 2.

If punitive damages are not awarded in such cases, it would only encourage unscrupulous persons who actuated by dishonest intention, use the well-reputed trademark of another person, so as to encash on the goodwill and reputation which that mark enjoys in the market, with impunity, and then avoid payment of damages by remaining absent from the Court, thereby depriving the plaintiff an opportunity to establish actual profit earned by him from use of the infringing mark, which can be computed only on the basis of his account books. This would, therefore, amount to putting premium on dishonesty and give an unfair advantage to an unscrupulous infringer over those who have a bona fide defence to make and therefore come forward to contest the suit and place their case before the Court.”",

                        "content": "This Court finds merit in the contention of the Plaintiffs that Defendant No. 1 by using the trademarks ‘INDIABULLS’, ‘DHANI’ and  www.indiabullsdhanifinance.co www.indianbulls.com  www.indiabullsdhani.com (device), which are identical to the Plaintiffs’ registered trademarks as well as by creating and operating the impugned domain name , which is deceptively similar to Plaintiffs’ domain names and , is infringing the statutory rights of the Plaintiffs. Defendant No. 1, under the aforesaid trademarks is providing services relating to financial transactions, personal loans etc., which are similar to those of the Plaintiffs and the consumer base is also the same. Therefore, in my view, the triple identity test of identical/deceptively similar trademarks, identical services and trade channels stands satisfied and use of the impugned trademarks/domain name by Defendant No. 1 constitutes infringement of the Plaintiffs’ registered trademarks. The Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980 has held that once there is imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the Plaintiffs’ rights are violated. Relevant passage from the said judgment is as under:  “28. ……..  While an action for passing off is a common law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of “the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods” (vide Section 21 of the Act). The  use by the defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.”",

In order to determine whether the plaintiffs have established the ingredients for successfully bringing an action for passing off it will be appropriate to advert to the broad principles of the law of passing off. In ‘Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names’-Supplement-pages 42 and 43, paragraph 16-02, the concept of passing off is stated thus:  The law of passing-off can be summarised in one short general proposition-no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number.  Firstly, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying ‘getup’ (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services.  Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to belief that the goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff.  Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in a quick time action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or service is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Plaintiffs have been continuously and extensively using the trademarks for their financial services, which is evident from the combined revenue of over Rs.14,640 crores as on 31.03.2019 of Plaintiff No. 1 and over Rs.1650 crores as on 31.03.2019 in respect of Plaintiff No. 2. Promotional and advertisement expenses run into Rs.47,24,92,990 for the financial years 2017-2019. The website as displayed is likely to lead the unwary consumers to assume a business connection between Defendant No. 1 and the Plaintiffs. Documents further evidence that Defendant No. 1 has been sending messages/e-mails to potential customers, portraying itself as a part of Plaintiffs’ companies and was also sending links for payments for loan applications with bank account details. Defendant No. 1 has also published a number on its website which, according to the averment in the plaint, though unrebutted, on the TrueCaller shows as ‘India Bulls Tollfree’. In light of the said facts and the settled law,  this Court finds that Defendant No. 1 has committed the tort of passing off.",

If punitive damages are not awarded in such cases, it would only encourage unscrupulous persons who actuated by dishonest intention, use the well-reputed trademark of another person, so as to encash on the goodwill and reputation which that mark enjoys  in the market, with impunity, and then avoid payment of damages by remaining absent from the Court, thereby depriving the plaintiff an opportunity to establish actual profit earned by him from use of the infringing mark, which can be computed only on the basis of his account books. This would, therefore, amount to putting premium on dishonesty and give an unfair advantage to an unscrupulous infringer over those who have a bona fide defence to make and therefore come forward to contest the suit and place their case before the Court.”",

The cause of action earlier arose in August, 2019 when upon receiving credible information, the Plaintiff learnt that the Defendants are manufacturing, soliciting, selling, marketing and trading the impugned goods under the Plaintiff•s said trademark/label in the City of Bangalore, Kamataka. The cause of action arose again on 24.08.2019, whena Criminal Complaints under Section 63 of the Copyright Act, 1957 were filed against Defendant No. 1 & 2 through  the representatives of the Plaintiff and subsequently the same culminated into FIR no. 0199/2019. The FIR No. 0199/2019 was lodged at Bomanhalli Police Station, Bangalore. The cause of action further arose when the search and seizure action was conducted on 24.08.2019 which saw the huge seizure of impugned counterfeit goods under the impugned trade Mark/label from the premises of Defendants. The cause of action has now arisen again in the second week of October 2020, when the Plaintiff was informed through the sources of markets and the trade that the representatives/concerned persons of the Defendants have started soliciting, networking about the impugned goods under the impugned trademark/label in markets of New Delhi. The cause of action also accrued when the Plaintiff caused an inquiry in the market, which revealed that the Defendants have not only started networking and soliciting but also procured orders from some dealers in New Delhi for supplying counterfeit goods under the impugned Trade Mark/Label. The cause of action further accrued when the Plaintiff learnt that there has been meticulous planning to sell the counterfeit goods in the markets of New Delhi under the impugned trademark/label in a clandestine and surreptitious manner The cause of action is still continuing and is accruing day-by-day and shall continue to so accrue till the Defendants ceases with their impugned adoption and user the impugned Trade Mark in relation to impugned goods.",

The Defendants are soliciting, networking, has intention to sell their impugned goods and business under the impugned trademarks/labels in the markets of New Delhi viz. Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Naraina, South Extension and adjoining areas. The Defendants are soliciting the impugned goods  manufactured by it through third party websites on the internet such as www.indiamart.com. which are interactive in nature and can be accessed by general consumers in New Delhi. The Plaintiff has a strong and credible apprehension that the Defendant will expand their operations under the impugned trading style/ trade mark in New Delhi and the threat that the Defendant will use the impugned trademarks/ labels within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court is credible and imminent, thus, giving rise to a substantial and integral part of the cause of action within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. Further the above apprehended activities of the Defendants will be within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. In addition the Defendant's infringing activities are likely to have a dynamic effect on the Plaintiffs business, both current and forthcoming, within the territory of New Delhi. It is evident that the dynamic effect of the Defendant•s activities are being felt in New Delhi and there exists an undeniable nexus between the cause of action in the present suit and the territory of New Delhi. Thus whole or part of cause of action for filing the suit has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court within the meaning of Section 20 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Further the Plaintiff is also carrying on its said goods and business under its said trade mark in New Delhi through its exclusive store located at Emporio Mall, Nelson Mandela Marg, Vasant Kunj II, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, Delhi 110070 and other dealers and distributors within the jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court.

The Defendants claimed that no selling unit/ production unit of the Defendants is working in Delhi. The Defendants also moved an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC with the prayer to reject the plaint on the ground of territorial jurisdiction. The said application was rejected by the Commercial Court on the ground that the Court has territorial jurisdiction as the Defendants are offering their products for sale through web-portal as also through dealers. It is also clear that the Defendants• are selling counterfeit goods in a clandestine manner. The finding of the Commercial Court is as under:  •7. Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff / non-applicant submitted that at the stage of application under order 7 rule 11 CPC court is required to consider only the averments of the plaint and the documents annexed with it at the time of institution of the suit on its face value. It was also submitted that at this stage court cannot consider the written statement or the documents filed by the defendants. In the plaint, plaintiff has clearly alleged that defendants are procuring the orders from Delhi and offering to sell his goods through web-portal. It is also alleged in plaint that the defendants have met dealers in New Delhi for sale of  their counterfeit goods. 8. Though it has been stated in the plaint that plaintiff  is selling its goods in a mall at New Delhi, the territorial jurisdiction of this court has been invoked mainly on the grounds of cause of action as per section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is established principal of law that at this stage court is required to look into the averments of the plaint and documents filed by the plaintiff and cannot go into the written statement and the pleas raised by the defendant in its documents. In my opinion, plaintiff has sufficiently stated in the plaint that defendants are offering their goods for sale through a web-portal as well as through dealers. It is clearly stated that defendants are planning to sell counterfeit goods in the territorial jurisdiction of this court in a clandestine manner. At this stage, court cannot enter into the roving enquiry into the merits or demerits of the respective contentions based on disputed facts. Prima-facie, from the averments of the plaint and the documents filed on record by the plaintiff, the cause of action has been established to be within the territorial jurisdiction of this court to entertain the suit.•",

Reliance is placed upon the website listing on IndiaMart which is noted as, •Shakti Fashion, Bengaluru, Bommanahalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka•. Furthermore, ld. Counsel refers to the seizure memo filed by the Plaintiff to exhibit that the raid was conducted in Bommanahalli on the Defendants, although the exact address may vary slightly. He submits that the large volume of products found during the seizure shows that the Defendants were undoubtedly involved in manufacturing counterfeit garments with counterfeit labels, tags and with the device mark of •BURBERRY•. He further submits that the existence of the Defendant•s products on the listing on IndiaMart has been admitted by the Defendants in the written statement at pages 266 and 267.

It has further been elaborated that material facts are such •preliminary• facts which must be proved at the trial by a party to establish the existence of a cause of action. It, therefore, follows that if a plaintiff were merely to state that a court has territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate a suit, that would not be sufficient. The plaintiff would have to plead as a fact as to how the court would have territorial jurisdiction. But, at the same time, the plaintiff would not have to give details of that material fact or the evidence by which the material fact is to be proved. •",

This seizure of products other than sanitizers was challenged by Defendant No.1 as being contrary to the clarification dated 11th August, 2020. Accordingly, the Commercial Court vide order dated 23rd September, 2020 directed release of masks seized, while holding that the release of the disinfectant sprays and hypochlorite solution seized would have to be decided along with the injunction application. In the meantime, Defendant No.1 had filed its written statement before the Commercial Court which stated that it was dealing in different goods and had different group entities. Accordingly, the Plaintiff moved an application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC read with Order I Rule 10 CPC, seeking to incorporate the various goods produced by the Defendants, to the list of impugned products as also to implead other group  entities of the Defendants, which was allowed by the Commercial Court vide the impugned order dated 10th January 2022. The Commercial Court allowed the applications, permitting the addition of the group companies of the Defendants to the suit pending between the parties, as also the addition of some impugned products. The relevant extracts of the impugned order are as under:  “ At the outset, there is no dispute that the amendment sought to be made is the outcome of the averments made by the defendant in the written statement and the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. Though it is averred that the plaintiff was very much aware about defendant no.1 and its group of companies from the very beginning, however, in view of the judgment in Lakha Ram Sharma's case (Supra), the question whether or not the claim made in the application is bonafide or not is to be decided at the trial of the suit.  The judgment relied by Ld. Counsel for defendant in Revajeetu Builders and Developers Vs. Naraina Swami and Sons & Ors. in Civil Appeal NO.6291/2009 pronounced on 09.10.2009 by the Apex Court, the judgment titled Colgate Palmolive Company & Ors. Vs. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. FAO (OS) 131/2012 decided on 19.07.2015 relied upon by Ld. Counsel for defendant are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case since the amendment sought to be made in the present case is the outcome of the written statement filed by the defendant and thus a subsequent event which could not have been known to the plaintiff as claimed, at the time of filing of the present case. The contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant that the plaintiff was aware of the said facts before the filing of the present suit is a matter of evidence.  The amendment sought to be made by the plaintiff is also necessary to decide the controversy in question completely and also to avoid the multiplicity of the litigation since admittedly the other group of companies of defendant are also dealing in the same goods under the impugned trademark SEMCO.  The plea with regard to the order dated 11.08.2020 does not come in the way of the present application since the written statement has been filed on 31.08.2020 i.e. after the clarification order was passed by Ld. Predecessor of this Court. It is also pertinent to mention here that the amendment proposed to be made does not at all change the nature of the suit. The matter is at the initial stage since the trial has yet not commenced. Hence, no prejudice shall be caused to defendant no.1 if the application for amendment is allowed.  In view of the above discussion, application under Order VI Rule 17 read with Order 1 Rule 10 and read with 151 CPC moved by plaintiff is allowed.”",
