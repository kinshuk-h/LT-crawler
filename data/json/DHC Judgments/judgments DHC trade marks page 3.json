It is clear that the work of filing the 31 Notices of Opposition was taken away from the appellant. So, there was no reason for the appellant to prepare/file those Notices of Opposition. In fact, it is not the case of the appellant that he has filed the 31 Notices of Opposition with Registrar of Trademark. Despite that the invoice for 31 Notice of Operation was raised by the appellant on June 07, 2006.",

That apart, in the absence of invoice being on record, it cannot be said that whether the same was raised for preparing the Notices of Opposition or for filing the same. It can be argued that the invoice was raised by the appellant for incurring expenses for preparing the Notices of Opposition. Such a stand could have been justified the invoice provided the appellant had sent the draft notices and raised invoice for the purpose of preparing them.

With respect to physical condition being changed or impaired, even in the absence of a statutory provision, the registered proprietor of a trade mark would have the right to oppose further dealing in those goods inasmuch as they would be the same goods improperly so called, or to put it differently, if a physical condition of goods is changed, it would no longer be the same goods. But, sub-section 4 of Section 30 is not restricted to only when the conditions of the goods has been changed or impaired after they have been put on the market. The section embraces all legitimate reasons to oppose further dealings in the goods. Thus, changing condition or impairment is only a specie of the genus legitimate reasons, which genus embraces other species as well. What are these species?

The only other question to be examined is the claim of damages of Rs. 20 lakh made in para 48(iii) (repeated) of the plaint. In this behalf, learned Counsel has  relied upon the judgments of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited v. Selection Footwear, 1999 PTC (19) 578; Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances, 1999 PTC (19) 685; and CS (OS) 2711/1999, L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co., 123 (2005) DLT 503 decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs. 3 lakh were awarded in favour of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, 125 (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the Court and they should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of Court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appear in Court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the Court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavour should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.",

Thus, a particular element of a composite mark which enjoys greater prominence vis-a-vis other constituent elements, may be termed as a „dominant mark‟.” It was further held that “the principle of „anti-dissection‟ does not impose an absolute embargo upon the consideration of the constituent elements of a composite mark. The said elements may be viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of „anti-dissection‟ and identification of „dominant mark‟ are not antithetical to one another and if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles rather compliment each other.”",

Before comparing the two trademarks for any similarities in the present case, one has to keep in mind the background in which the defendant adopted the trademark in respect of its product. It is not disputed that M/s. Sudesh Hardware Pvt. Ltd. (defendant No. 3), of which Mr.Ashok Jain (defendant No. 1) was a henchman, was the distributor of the plaintiff for over 25 years. As distributor, they were selling the goods of the plaintiff with trademark FREEMANS. Mr.Ashok Jain has now started the firm FREEDOM MEASURES (defendant No. 2) and under banner he has started manufacturing the same product, namely measuring tapes, and has adopted the trademark FREEDOM. Case of the plaintiff is that, as distributor of the plaintiff's product for 25 years, Mr. Ashok Jain came to be recognized in the market as FREEDOM FITEWALLA and with such a reputation acquired while working as distributor for the plaintiff, adoption of the trademark FREEDOM, after starting its own business and producing the same product, would obviously not be bona fide. It is clear that the defendants wanted to encash upon the goodwill of the plaintiff's product in which they had themselves trader for quarter of a century. When the two words FREEDOM and FREEMANS are compared in the aforesaid backdrop, and the person who was up to now selling the goods of FREEMANS and comes out with the goods with the trademark FREEDOM, with same customers, it is bound to cause confusion in the minds of the customers. The two words may not be exactly same, but adoption of the word FREEDOM, which resembles closely with the trademark FREEMANS of the plaintiff, with same clientele, may lead to confusion. It is the word FREE appearing in the plaintiff's trademark which has been tried to be exploited by adopting the word FREEDOM. Had there not been any association of the defendants with the  plaintiff and they had not represented the plaintiff as its distributors for a long period of 25 years by selling their goods and establishing their own reputation as FREEDOM FITEWALLA, things could have been different. The customers who had been buying the goods of the plaintiff from the defendants earlier with prominence of FREE in their mind are likely to be confused that these are the same goods sold by the defendants and, therefore, are of the same quality and reputation. The fact that when the defendants were selling the goods of the plaintiff with the trademark FREEMANS and came to be known as FREEDOM FITEWALLA, it would show that the consumers did not perceive any difference between the words FREEMAN and FREEDOM. It is the word FREE appearing in the plaintiff's trademark FREEMANS which strikes in the mind of the users of the goods of the plaintiff for more than 50 years. Therefore, this case would almost be same as the case of Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. Hind Cycle Ltd., 1973 ILR Delhi Vol. 1 where the defendant, who had adopted the trademark ROYAL STAR, was injuncted as it was found that the plaintiff's trademark EASTERN STAR had acquired a reputation and came to be known to the public as STAR cycles or TARA BRAND CYCLES.",

Thus, certain distinctions sought to be projected by the defendants would not be able to remove the confusion which is likely to arise in the minds of the customers. It is stated at the cost of repetition that the adoption of the trademark FREEDOM by the defendants is utterly mala fide. When the defendants had been the distributors of the plaintiff's products and sold those products with the trademark FREEMANS for a long period and wanted their own production of the same product, why the word FREEDOM only came in the minds of the defendants to be adopted as trademark,  which bears close resemblance to the plaintiff's trademark FREEMANS, is one thing which is not explained by the defendants at all. It is a clever device opted by the defendants to adopt the trademark FREEDOM and, thereafter, in the cartons, etc. put some distinguishing features so as to press the same as defense when the plaintiff takes legal action, as the present one, against the defendants. The attempt is to confuse the customers by adopting the same name and features and to confuse the Court by trying to show the alleged dissimilarities. Such an attempt has to fail.” (Emphasis Supplied)",

                        "content": "Learned counsel for the Defendants strenuously urged that the injunction order passed by this Court be vacated on the following grounds:- a.  Defendants No. 1 and 2 are in the business of manufacturing and distribution of automobile lubricants and grease.  www.sparkmindalube.com Defendant No. 2 runs its business under the trademark MINDAUTO. Defendant No. 3 is a proprietorship entity and is in the business of distribution of lubricants and grease under the mark MINDAUTO. Defendants No. 1 and 3 are sister concerns of Defendant No. 2 and collectively operate the website .  b.  Defendants have applied for registration of various trademarks such as ‘UNOMINDA’, ‘SPARKMINDA’, ‘MINDAUTO PLUS’,’MINDAUTO MAX’ and ‘MINDA UTO PRO’ in class 04 for lubricants, industrial oil, grease, engine and brake oil. Defendant No. 3 has applied for registration of UNOMINDA on 29.09.2019 in class 04 for lubricants, etc. and has obtained registration for the mark MINDAUTO, applied for under application dated 03.07.2018 in class 04 for lubricants, industrial oil and grease, while applications for other trademarks under classes 01 and 04 are pending registrations. Defendant No. 3 has been continuously using the trademark SPARKMINDA since 2019 and has gathered considerable popularity in the market with considerable sales.  c.  Since Defendants have registration for the trademark MINDAUTO, Plaintiffs cannot seek relief of infringement with respect to the goods for which the trademark is registered, in view of the provisions of Section 28(3) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’).  d.  Defendants are not using the word MINDA alone and have used a suffix UTO with the said mark, while the Plaintiffs’  trademark MINDA is with a prefix UNO. ‘UNO’ and ‘UTO’ are phonetically different and even from a visual perspective the actual label/mark MINDAUTO is nowhere close to the device mark of the Plaintiffs. The rival trademarks are registered for goods falling in different classes and the nature of goods is also different and thus, there can be no confusion or association in the minds of the public and no case of infringement is made out. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Nandhini Deluxe v. Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited, (2018) 9 SCC 183, more particularly, with respect to the observations made by the Supreme Court that where not only the visual appearance of the two marks is different but if they relate to different products, it is difficult to imagine that an average man of ordinary intelligence would associate the goods of the Appellant with the Respondent. By way of an illustration, it was contended that the trademark ‘Jaguar’ is a trademark of two companies, where one deals in automobiles and the other in sanitary fittings.  e.  Even if the present suit is to be treated as a suit for passing off, no case is made out against the Defendants, who are prior users of the trademark MINDAUTO since the year 2018, in class 04 for lubricants, industrial oils and grease. Plaintiffs have, as per their own case, entered into the business of sale of lubricants only in the year 2021 under the trademark SPARK MINDA and no document has been placed on record by the  Plaintiffs to show their sales in lubricants, industrial oil, etc., prior to the Defendants.  f.  The total sales of Defendant No. 3 for financial years 2018-19 to 2021-22 have increased from Rs.3,49,56,195/-to Rs.4,84,02,415/-, out of which the sales of products under the trademark MINDAUTO have increased from Rs.24,46,933/-in financial year 2018-19 to Rs.72,60,362/-in financial year 2021-22 and similarly the sales under the trademark SPARKMINDA have nearly doubled in the financial year 2021-22. Defendants have spent considerable amount of money in advertising their products.  g.  Present suit is not maintainable as the trade name MINDA is a common name and also the name of a village in District Nagaur in Rajasthan and the forefathers of the Defendants belong to the said village. Being a common name, no entity can be given a monopoly or an exclusive right to use the same.  h.  Nature of the businesses of the Plaintiffs and Defendants is totally different inasmuch as Plaintiffs are in the business of making and selling automobile spare parts while Defendants are into sale of lubricants, industrial oils and grease.  i.  Purpose of a trademark is to identify the source and avoid confusion in the minds of the buyers. In the present case, since both parties are manufacturing different products coupled with the fact that Plaintiffs have not produced any material to show that customers have been confused in the competing trademarks, it is apparent that there is no likelihood of  confusion in the minds of the purchasers. Reliance was placed on the judgment in Sambhav Kapur v. British Indo German Industrial Organics Private Ltd. and Ors., 2016 SCC OnLine Del 6379, wherein it was held that if it is found that the suit does not disclose a cause for alleging passing off, on which the relief is based, it can be dismissed at the threshold, merely by looking at the pleadings and the documents filed by the Plaintiff.  j.  There are several other entities which have registrations in the trade name MINDA, however, Plaintiffs have not raised any objection against them. Illustratively, Trademarks such as LUMINDA in class 35, MINDALUX, SIGNMINDA, GK MINDA SOLAR and GK MINDA in class 11, and ABMINDA in class 04 were cited by the Defendants. Even though ABMINDA is registered in the same class as the Plaintiffs, no objections have been raised.",

                        "content": "Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Plaintiffs raised the following contentions and also refuted the submissions made on behalf of the Defendants:- a.  Plaintiffs are registered proprietors, prior users and exclusive owners of the brand name MINDA and its formative trademarks. Use of any trademark which is identical or deceptively similar to the said mark is in violation of the coveted statutory and common law rights of the Plaintiffs. The impugned marks/labels in the present case bear a high degree of similarity with the Plaintiffs registered and prior used  trademarks/labels MINDA,  /SPARK MINDA  and /UNO MINDA. Apart from the identity with the word MINDA, there is a high degree of visual and conceptual similarity, owing to use of similar colour combinations, font size, style of writing, etc. The colour scheme in the competing marks is a combination of blue and white with the words UNO and MINDA written in two separate boxes and UNO in a white colour on a blue background in the Plaintiffs’ mark, while UTO is in a white/blue colour on a blue/white background. It is apparent that trademarks of the Plaintiffs have been slavishly copied to show an association with the Minda Group and encash on its goodwill. The comparative table, as brought forth in the plaint, is as follows:- b.  The impugned marks so closely resemble the registered trademarks of the Plaintiffs that it is likely to deceive and cause confusion in relation to the goods in respect of which Plaintiffs trademarks are registered. The goods sold by the Defendants, i.e., ‘lubricants, industrial oils and grease’ are identical to the goods sold by the Plaintiffs’, i.e, engine oil. Further the goods are also similar to the other goods sold by the Plaintiffs, categorised as automobile parts, which specifically include fuel systems, fuel hoses and canisters, being allied and cognate. With the similarity in competing trademarks, identity/similarity in goods and identical trade channels and consumer base, the triple test stands satisfied and the likelihood of confusion amongst a purchaser with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, cannot be ruled out.  c.  ‘MINDA’ is the surname of the founder of Minda Group of Companies and Chairman of the UNO MINDA and SPARK  MINDA Group of Companies and has been bonafidely adopted by the Plaintiffs. In any case, no defence under Sections 12, 30 and 35 of the Act can be claimed by the Defendants, since the trademarks of the Plaintiffs have acquired distinctiveness through continuous, extensive and uninterrputed use over the decades, giving rights to the Plaintiffs to restrain and enjoin any third party from using identical or deceptively similar marks. Per contra Defendants’, on the other hand, have given no explanation to adopt the mark MINDA apart from a vague plea that it is a name of a village where the forefathers lived. No proof of association with the said village has been filed by the Defendants and in any case it is not open to them to contend that MINDA is a generic mark after they have themselves applied for its registration in different forms. Reliance was placed on the judgments in Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan & Anr., 1999 SCC OnLine Del 27 and Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. v. Procter & Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. & Ors., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 2968.  d.  Contention of the Defendants that their trademark MINDA UTO is registered for goods in class 04 while Plaintiffs’ trademarks are not registered with respect to goods in class 04 and therefore, no infringement is made out, is misconceived. It is a settled law that classification of goods and services adopted by the Registry or the international classification is not the determining factor for ascertaining the similarity of goods. Test  of similarity has to be judged from a business and commercial point of view and factors such as trade channels, nature of goods and use of goods ought to be considered. Reliance was placed on the judgments in Assam Roofing Ltd. & Anr. v. JSB Cement LLP & Anr., 2015 SCC OnLine Cal 6581 and Dharampal Premchand Ltd. v. M/S. Ganpati Wood Products,  2002 SCC OnLine Del 839. The contention that rival goods are disimilar and thus, the Plaintiffs have no case for alleging infringement under Section 29 of the Act, is equally misplaced. Section 29 (2)(b) of the Act clearly provides that a registered trademark is infringed by a person, who not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of its similarity to the registered trademark and similarity of goods and services covered by such registered trademark is likely to cause confusion in the public or an association with the registered trademark. It is settled that similarity of goods would include a case where the impugned goods are cognate and allied to the goods of a Plaintiff, for which the trademark is registered. In the present case, there is no gainsaying that the lubricants, industrial oils and grease sold by the Defendants are allied and cognate to the goods of the Plaintiffs, which can be broadly categorised as automobile spare parts.  e.  Defendants by adopting a deceptively similar trademark for identical/similar products in the course of trade are misrepresenting to the public that their goods have an  association with the Plaintiffs and are not only deceiving the customers but are also causing irreparable damage and injury to the immense reputation of the Plaintiffs and are thus guilty of passing off.  f.  www.sparkmindalube.com  Defendants are operating a website under the name and style and the use of the words minda/spark minda indicates a fraudulent association with the Plaintiffs. There is no credible justification for using the domain name with the mark MINDA with such a close phonetic and visual resemblance.  g.  Plaintiffs’ marks consist of a collection of elements such as colour, text, shape, colour combinations and constitute ‘artistic work’ under Section 2(c) of the Copyright Act, 1957. Plaintiffs have copyright registrations in the MINDA label as well as the formative device marks and the blatant and deliberate reproduction of the essential and prominent features of the marks by the Defendants amounts to Copyright infringement under Section 51(a)(i) of the said act.",

                        "content": "Comparing the competing marks, leads to a prima facie conclusion that the impugned mark is phonetically identical and structurally and visually similar to the registered trademark of the Plaintiffs. Section 28 of the Act gives to the registered proprietor of the trademark, if valid, subject to other provisions of the Act, two valuable rights: (a) the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trademark is registered and (b) to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trademark, in the manner provided by the Act. Section 29 deals with infringement of registered trademarks and provides that a registered trademark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which on account of its identity with the registered trademark and similarity of goods or services covered by such registered trademark or its similarity to the registered trademark and identity or similarity of the goods or its identity with the registered trademark and identity of the goods, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public or have an association with the registered trademark. In Cadila Health Care  Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, wherein the product in question was medicine, sold under the brand name Falcitab and the  competing mark was Falcigo, the Supreme Court formulated the following tests:- “16. Dealing once again with medicinal products, this Court in F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. Ltd. v. Geoffrey Manner & Co. (P) Ltd. [(1969) 2 SCC 716] had to consider whether the word “Protovit” belonging to the appellant was similar to the word “Dropovit” of the respondent. This Court, while deciding the test to be applied, observed at pp. 720-21 as follows: (SCC para 7)  “The test for comparison of the two word marks were formulated by Lord Parker in Pianotist Co. Ltd.'s application [(1906) 23 RPC 774] as follows:  ‘You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact, you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks. If, considering all those circumstances, you come to the conclusion that there will be a confusion, that is to say, not necessarily that one man will be injured and the other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be a confusion in the mind of the public which will lead to confusion in the goods — then you may refuse the registration, or rather you must refuse the registration in that case.’  It is necessary to apply both the visual and phonetic tests. In Aristoc Ltd. v. Rysta Ltd. [62 RPC 65] the House of Lords was considering the resemblance between the two words ‘Aristoc’ and ‘Rysta’. The view taken was that considering the way the words were pronounced in English, the one was likely to be mistaken for the other. Viscount Maugham cited the following passage of Lord Justice Lukmoore in the Court of Appeal, which passage, he said, he completely accepted as the correct exposition of the law:  ‘The answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too nearly the sound of another so as to bring the former within the limits of Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act, 1938, must nearly always depend on first impression, for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has perhaps an imperfect recollection of it who is likely to be deceived or confused. Little assistance, therefore, is to be obtained from a meticulous comparison of the two words, letter by letter and syllable by syllable, pronounced with the clarity to be expected from a teacher of elocution. The Court must be careful to make allowance for imperfect recollection and the effect of careless pronunciation and speech on the part not only of the person seeking to buy under the trade description, but also of the shop assistant ministering to that person's wants.’  It is also important that the marks must be compared as wholes. It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is whether the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or mistake in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark. Thus in Lavroma case [Tokalon Ltd. v. Davidson & Co., 32 RPC 133] Lord Johnston said:  ‘… we are not bound to scan the words as we would in a question of comparatio literarum. It is not a matter for microscopic inspection, but to be taken from the general and even casual point of view of a customer walking into a shop.’  On the facts of that case this Court came to the conclusion that taking into account all circumstances the words “Protovit” and “Dropovit” were so dissimilar that there was no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from visual or phonetic point of view.”",

                        "content": "In the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court also held that principle of phonetic similarity cannot be jettisoned, even when the manner in which the competing words are written, is different. In Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449, the test of phonetic similarity was applied by the Supreme Court in judging the two competing marks ‘AMRITDHARA’ and ‘LAKSHMANDHARA’. It would be useful to allude to paras 6 and 7 of the judgment, which are extracted hereunder:- “6. It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and relevant for our purpose are ‘likely to deceive or cause confusion’. The Act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion. Therefore, every case must depend on its own particular facts, and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion. On an application to register, the Registrar or an opponent may object that the trade mark is not registrable by reason of clause (a) of Section 8, or sub-section (1) of Section 10, as in this case. In such a case the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade mark applied for is not likely to deceive or cause confusion. In cases in which the tribunal considers that there is doubt as to whether deception is likely, the application should be refused. A trade mark is likely to deceive or cause confusion by its resemblance to another already on the register if it is likely to do so in the course of its legitimate use in a market where the two marks are assumed to be in use by traders in that market. In considering the matter, all the circumstances of the case must be considered. As was observed by Parker, J. in Pianotist Co.'s Application, Re [(1906) 23 RPC 774] which was also a case of the comparison of two words—  ‘You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact you must consider all the surrounding  circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners of the marks.’ (p. 777)  For deceptive resemblance two important questions are: (1) who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to be adopted in judging whether such resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state of mind of a customer who, on seeing a mark thinks that it differs from the mark on goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection.",

                        "content": "Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshman-dhara” are in use in respect of the same description of goods, namely a medicinal preparation for the alleviation of various ailments. Such medicinal preparation will be purchased mostly by people who instead of going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for the quick alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As we said in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd. [(1960) (1) SCR 968] the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara” is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words as “current of nectar” or “current of Lakshman”. He would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and  the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see the difference between “current of nectar” and “current of Lakshman”. “Current of Lakshman” in a literal sense has no meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the inference that the “current or stream” is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. He would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.”",

Expressed in another way, if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.",

Where the two marks are identical no further questions arise; for then the infringement is made out. When the two marks are not identical, the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiff's registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered (Vide Section 21). A point has sometimes been raised as to whether the words “or cause confusion” introduce any element which is not already covered by the words “likely to deceive” and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially to the concept indicated by the earlier words “likely to deceive”. But this apart, as the question arises in an action for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is registered, is deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison of the two marks — the degree of resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception not being capable of definition by laying down objective standards. The persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The purpose of the comparison is for determining whether the essential features of the plaintiff's trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant. The identification of the essential features of the mark is in essence a question of fact and depends on the judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff.”  trademark of the Plaintiffs, i.e., and that of the Defendants, i.e., , which is an important index, apart from structural and 21.

Testing on the anvil of these parameters, in my prima facie view, the goods of the Defendants, manufactured and sold under the impugned sector i.e. automobiles. Lubricants, industrial oils and grease, which are the goods of the Defendants and the automobile parts, which are the goods of the Plaintiffs are used in vehicles and are invariable sold in the same shops. Therefore, the consumer base is the same and the trade channels are identical and there is likelihood of confusion and/or association that the goods of the Defendants are those of the Plaintiffs’. This Court is thus of prima facie opinion that the rival goods being similar in nature and the competing trademark being identical/similar, a prima facie case of infringement under Section 29(2)(b) of the Act is made out.",

While examining the likelihood of confusion, the Court would take into consideration factors such as nature of the market, class of customers, extent of reputation of the Plaintiff, trade channels, trade connection, in conjunction. It is indisputable that passing off is an action predicated on the goodwill, unlike infringement, which is based on a proprietary right conferred by registration of the trademark. It is an action of deceit by the Defendant and gives the common law right to the Plaintiff to protect its goodwill in business against misrepresentation caused in the trade by the Defendant and is based on the principle that no person can be permitted to carry on his or her business on the pretext that it is the business of another.",

In my view, this contention is completely misconceived and is in the teeth of several judgments of this  Court, holding to the contrary. In Mahendra & Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd.  v.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., (2002) 2 SCC 147, the primordial submission of the Appellant was that in the absence of any similarity of goods manufactured or sold by the parties the question of deception or confusion amongst the consumers did not arise. The Supreme Court, rejecting the said contention held that the Plaintiff had acquired immense reputation and the name had become distinctive of the Plaintiff and thus any attempt by any other person to use the name in business and trade circles is likely to create an impression or a connection with the Plaintiff’s Group of Companies and would prejudicially effect the business and trading activities of the Plaintiff. In Kamal Trading Co. Bombay and Ors. v. Gillettee U.K. Limited, Middle Sex, England, 1987 SCC OnLine Bom 754, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held as follows:  “9. Relying on this observation; Mr. Desai submitted that the plaintiffs have not established any of the conditions required for grant of interim relief. It was submitted that the goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are different nature; the plaintiffs manufacture blades, while the defendants manufacture “tooth brushes”. The goods of the plaintiffs and the defendants are available in the same shop and the customers of these goods are different. The goods sold by the plaintiffs are blades and fall in Class 8, while those of the defendants are tooth brushes which fall in class 21. Relying on these circumstances, it is contended that there was no likelihood of any deception. We are unable to see any merit in this submission. In the first instance, the assumption of the learned counsel that the class of customers for purchase of safety blades and tooth brushes are different and these goods are not available in the same shops is wholly misconceived. We take judicial notice of the fact that these goods are available in every shop including a small shop and each and every person is required to purchase these goods. The safety blades and tooth brushes are items of daily requirement and  are required by every person. It is impossible to accept the submission that as the goods being different and as goods are set out in different Classes in the Schedule to the Act, there is not any likelihood of customer being deceived.”",

                        "content": "In Bajaj Electricals Ltd. v. Metals and Allied Products, Bombay and Anr., AIR 1988 Bom 167, the primary contention of the Defendants was that the goods manufactured by the Plaintiffs and the Defendants were totally different and therefore the use of word ‘BAJAJ’ would not cause confusion. Be it noted that the Plaintiffs were manufacturing electrical goods and appliances under Class 11, whereas Defendants were manufacturing utensils under Class 21. Holding that Defendants had intentionally and dishonestly tried to pass off their goods by use of the name ‘BAJAJ’, the Court observed as under:- “8. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that it is not really necessary to consider different judgments of the House of Lords because Lord Denning had also observed that the defendants would have no defence if the user of the name of the defendants is likely to deceive irrespective of the fact whether the user was honest and that conclusion of Lord Denning is also approved by Lord Devlin who was in minority. Mr. Tulzapurkar submitted that in the present case, there is a specific evidence on record that the word “Bajaj” was used by the defendants dishonestly and deliberately with a view to take advantage of the reputation earned by the plaintiffs. The learned counsel referred to us to a passage at p. 408 in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, and submitted that once intent to deceive is established, then the defendants could not claim that they were entitled to use word “Bajaj” as a trading sign. In support of the submission, the learned counsel invited our attention to the brochure (Ex. ‘G’ annexed to the plaint) wherein the defendants have claimed that Bajaj quality is well accepted and appreciated internationally. Mr. Tulzapurkar points out and it is not in dispute that the defendants have never marketed their goods abroad, nor have  they even claimed that their goods are sold all over the country. Mr. Tulzapurkar is right and we agree with the learned trial Judge that the brochure published in the year 1987 is issued with a view to cause deception or confusion in the mind of the customers. The word ‘Bajaj’ has quite a great reputation in the country and abroad and the publication of the brochure in year 1987 clearly indicates that the defendants were not honest in the use of the word “Bajaj” and an attempt was made to pass off their goods with the mark “Bajaj” with the intention to secure advantage of the reputation earned by the plaintiffs.  The submission of Mr. Tulzapurkar was controverted by Mr. Cooper by urging that the goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are totally different and, therefore, there is no cause or apprehension that the use of the word “Bajaj” is likely to cause deception or confusion in the mind of the public. Mr. Cooper submitted that the articles manufactured by the defendants are utensils and those marketed by the plaintiffs are electrical goods or appliances and, therefore, it is unlikely that the purchasers of utensils would be confused by the use of the word “Bajaj” on the articles of the defendants. The learned counsel submitted that the plaintiffs' goods are sold under registered mark under Class 11, while the goods manufactured by the defendants fall under Class 21. Class 11 refers to installations for lighting, heating, steam generating, cooking, refrigerating, drying, ventilating, and other purposes, while Class 21 refers to small domestic utensils and containers (not of precious metal nor coated therewith). The submission of Mr. Cooper is that as the articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are different, the question of deception would not arise. It is not possible to accept the submission. The articles manufactured by the plaintiffs and the defendants are kitchen wares and are commonly used in almost every kitchen in this country. The mere fact that the articles manufactured by the contesting parties are different in nature is no answer to the claim that the defendants are guilty of passing off. We entirely agree with the conclusion recorded by the learned trial Judge that there is identity of the goods, the mark and  the consumer and the goods manufactures by both the plaintiffs and the defendants are sold under one shop. Mr. Cooper complained that the electric goods manufactured by the plaintiffs and the stainless steel utensils manufactured by the defendants are not sold in one shop. The submission is not accurate because it is common experience that kitchen ware or kitchen appliances like mixers, grinders, pressure cookers, and stainless steel utensils are sold in the same shop. At this interim stage, we are not prepared to accept the submission of Mr. Cooper on this count and we see no reason to take different view from that of the learned single Judge on this aspect. In our judgment, prima facie, it is clear that the defendants have intentionally and dishonestly tried to pass off their goods by use of name “Bajaj”.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

In any event, this defence is even otherwise not available to the Defendants, as their goods are not dissimilar, but are allied and cognate, i.e., similar and thus, the position adopted by the Defendants that passing off action is not maintainable, cannot be accepted. In this context, it would be useful to allude to a judgment of the Bombay High Court in H.M. Saraiya and Ors. v. Ajanta India Ltd. and Ors., 2006 SCC OnLine Bom 1394, where the Court held as under:- “72. Insofar as the question of totally distinct goods and biscuits are concerned, it appears that there is a much expansion of law so as to hold that there is no requirement of common field of activity in a passing off action. The judgments which have been relied upon by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs being Kirloskar Diesel Recon Pvt. Ltd. v. Kirloskar Proprietary Ltd., (supra) and Aktiebolaget Volvo v. Volvo Steels Ltd. (supra) supports the aforesaid contention. In my opinion, it is not doubt true that for the purposes of passing off action in respect of totally dissimilar business or in respect of  goods which are poles aparts only if it can establish that plaintiffs have acquired such a reputation in a particular name or a brand that the user by the other person even in respect of distinct product would amount to passing off his business and his good will as that of the other person. So as to be entitled to such reliefs the reputation of the brand should have acquired a Global status or super brand status and the business of the plaintiffs must be trans border or trans products. However, that does not mean that in relation of cognate or allied product the plaintiff is not entitled to interim injunction as contended by the learned counsel for the defendants. It is equally not a correct proposition of law advanced by the learned counsel for the defendants that in respect of the allied product or cognate product or supplementary product the plaintiffs must actually prove confusion and/or produce evidence that in market there is an actual confusion and merely likelihood of confusion is not counsel for the plaintiffs indicate that even if there is a likelihood of a confusion by virtue of the fact that the goods are so closely similar and/or are allied products or supplementary that there is a likelihood of confusion in the mind of the public that a person is using the similar brand name merely to pass off his goods as that of the plaintiffs is itself sufficient for the purpose of grant of interim order and injunction in a passing off action.",

                        "content": "Even in my judgment in the case of Indiacom Limited v. Tata Teleservices Ltd. dated 28.10.2005 (Notice of Motion No. 1837 of 2003 in Suit No. 1908 of 2003) I have held that in light of series of judgments of this Court a proposition of law is now well settled that the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction on the basis of cognate product and/or allied product and/or complemantary products if the goods are so closely similar to that of the goods of the plaintiffs so as to lead to a likelihood of confusion in market that the goods sold by the defendants in fact belong to the plaintiffs. The learned counsel for the plaintiffs has relied upon two judgments of the Apex Court though arising out of Sales Tax Act in which it is inter alia held that the word “toiletry” includes both tooth paste and tooth brush. In my opinion, tooth paste and tooth brush are undoubtedly complementary products and/or allied  product the use of each other is together and in my opinion dependent on each other. In such a situation it is easily likely to create confusion in the minds of the public that the goods belonging to one party in fact belongs to the other party. I am inclined to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that they are selling tooth brushes in the market since 1950 would obviously make the people believe that ‘Ajanta’ tooth paste which has been introduced by the defendants is the product belonging to the plaintiffs and thus there is a likelihood of confusion in the market. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the contention of the learned counsel for the defendants that the said goods even if they are complementary or cognate should not be itself be sufficient enough to grant interim injunction in respect of passing off action on the ground that the plaintiffs have not established actual confusion in the market in respect of the said product is liable to be rejected. I am also of the view that the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Corn Products (supra) supports the aforesaid view I have taken that the goods being cognate or allied products by virtue of trade connection or trade relation would be sufficient enough to create a confusion in the mind of the people in the market and, therefore, it is necessary that the injunction should be granted to the plaintiffs insofar as the said product of the defendants being tooth paste is concerned under the brand name ‘Ajanta’. In my opinion, once the law is well settled that in respect of the allied product or cognate product the injunction can be granted and further in my opinion that tooth paste and tooth brush being allied and/or cognate products, it is not necessary to make any further enquiry in the matter and the necessary interim order ought to be granted to the plaintiffs herein. However, the learned counsel for the defendants has contended that there is a distinct get up of the box and has tried to bring a distinction in the packet of two products which are sold in the market under the same brand ‘Ajanta’ and has, therefore, contended that the ‘get up’ being different, there is no likelihood of any confusion and, therefore, this Court should not grant any interim injunction. I have also compared both the said packets and its get ups. Firstly, ‘word mark’ is identical.  Secondly phonetically also both the marks are the same. The colour scheme of both the packets is almost identical. Merely because on the defendants tooth paste there is an emblem ‘Dento Fresh’ and on the tooth brush packet of the plaintiffs there is a photograph of mother and son would not be sufficient enough to create a distinctiveness between the two products so as to hold that there is no likelihood of any confusion in the market. In my opinion, there is no much distinction between ‘get up’ of the plaintiffs packets and that of the defendants packet look is substantially identical, the word characters are also identical and, therefore, in my opinion the plaintiffs are entitled to injunction of ‘passing off’ on the ground that the defendants are seeking to pass off their goods as that belonging to the plaintiffs.”",

It is the case of the Plaintiffs, as averred and argued, that they are a part of the MINDA Group of Companies which is a conglomerate comprising several companies, manufacturing diverse auto components for Indian and International Original Equipment Manufacturers. Founded in the year 1958 by late Shri Shadi Lal Minda, Plaintiffs’ businesses under the flagship name MINDA have grown multi-fold over the years and it has emerged as one of the largest automotive components’ conglomerate. As of 31.03.2021, the annual turnover of the Plaintiffs’ group of companies is Rs. 8,741 crores with the goods and services spread over more than seven countries apart from India. It has more than 104 plants globally and 25 R&D centres across India with 40 group companies and 15 global technology partners.

From the averments as aforementioned, which are duly supported by documents filed along with the plaint, I am of the prima facie view that the Plaintiffs enjoy immense reputation and goodwill in India and in fact, this explains the reason why the Defendants chose to dishonestly adopt the deceptively similar to that of the Plaintiffs. It is clear that the Defendants intended to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiffs by misrepresenting to the members of the public that the goods of the Defendants have an association with that of the Plaintiffs and/or emanate from the house of the MINDA Group of Companies. Therefore, Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of passing off against the Defendants in respect of the goods sold under the impugned mark and  have been able to establish that the nature of marks, nature of goods and class of purchasers are similar and that on account of the high degree of resemblance between the marks there exists a likelihood of confusion.",

Sub-section (3) of Section 28 with which we are directly concerned, contemplates a situation where two or more persons are registered proprietors of the trade marks which are identical with or nearly resemble each other. It, thus,  postulates a situation where same or similar trade mark can be registered in favour of more than one person. On a plain stand-alone reading of this Section, it is clear that the exclusive right to use of any of those trade marks shall not be deemed to have been acquired by one registrant as against other registered owner of the trade mark (though at the same time they have the same rights as against third person). Thus, between the two persons who are the registered owners of the trade marks, there is no exclusive right to use the said trade mark against each other, which means this provision gives concurrent right to both the persons to use the registered trade mark in their favour. Otherwise also, it is a matter of common sense that the plaintiff cannot say that its registered trade mark is infringed when the defendant is also enjoying registration in the trade mark and such registration gives the defendant as well right to use the same, as provided in Section 28(1) of the Act.”",

The Court held as follows:- “28. Section 28(3) of the TM Act cannot be interpreted in a manner that would be contrary to the above scheme of the Act and Rules. In other words Section 28(3) of the TM Act should be understood as not permitting an infringement action being brought by one registered proprietor against another only where two conditions are satisfied : one, that the two  registered marks “are identical with or nearly resemble each other”; and two, they are in respect of the same class of goods and services. This will be in conformity with the object of Section 28(1) read with Section 29 of the TM Act which seeks to grant protection to the registered proprietor of a mark from infringement in respect of the goods for which registration is granted.”",

                        "content": "Reliance in the aforesaid case was placed by the Court on an earlier judgment of this Court in Rana Steels v. Ran India Steels Pvt. Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 399, which is evident from para 26. Relevant paras of the judgment in A. Kumar Milk Foods Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) are extracted hereunder for ready reference:- “26. The facts of the present case are closer to the facts in Rana Steels v. Ran India Steels Pvt. Ltd., 2008 (102) DRJ 503. The dispute there concerned the use of the Plaintiff's trademark, RANA, registered under Class 6, by the Defendant who had a registered trademark, RANA TOR, under Class 19. While allowing the Plaintiff's prayer for confirmation of an earlier ex parte injunction granted against the Defendant, the Court explained the scope Section 28 of the Act, in para 23, as follows:  “… Section 28 deals with the rights conferred by registration. And, it has already been clarified that the use of a registered mark must be in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. It follows that where the goods or services, in respect of which two or more identical or similar (nearly resemble) marks are registered, are different then Section 30(2)(e) does not come into play. The question of infringement would, itself, not arise as the registered marks would be used in respect of different classes of goods or services by their respective proprietors. A couple of examples would further clarify the position:  Example 1 : Assume that a trade mark “M” has been registered in favor of Mr “X” as well as in favor of Mr “Y” in relation to the same goods or services. In such a situation, by virtue of Section 28(3), neither Mr “X” nor Mr “Y” can claim exclusivity against each other for the use of the said mark in relation to the goods or services for which it was registered. If Mr “X” were to bring an action for infringement against Mr “Y”, the latter would have a complete defense under Section 30(2)(e).  Example 2 : Let us now assume that there are two different goods “A” and “B” in respect of which the same trademark “M” has been registered in favor of different persons “X” and “Y”, respectively. Here, although the same mark “M” is registered in favor of both Mr “X” and Mr “Y”, Mr “X” has exclusive right to use the same in respect of good “A” and Mr “Y” has exclusive right to use the said mark in respect of good “B”. Therefore, Section 28(3) is not attracted. Moreover, if Mr “X” were to bring an action of infringement against Mr “Y” alleging that Mr “Y” was using the said mark “M” in relation to good “A”, then, the defense of Section 30(2)(e) would not be available to Mr “Y” as he does not have any right to use the mark “M” in relation to good “A”, his registration being in relation to good “B”.",

In Rana Steels (Supra) Plaintiff had registration of the trademark RANA registered in respect of goods falling under class 06, i.e., steel rolled products, angles, channels, guarders, etc. and Defendant was a registered proprietor of the mark RANA TOR in respect to building material (steels) falling under Class 19. On the strength of Section 28(3) and 30(2)(e) of the Act, Defendant claimed that it had not infringed Plaintiff’s registered trademark. The Court in this context observed as under:- “21. A reading of the relevant provisions of Sections 28 and 29 of the said Act, therefore, reveals that the registration of a trade mark is linked to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. If a person uses a registered trade mark in relation to goods and services which are different and distinct from the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered, then he would not be infringing the registered trade mark except in the case covered by Sub-Section (4) of Section 29 which requires that the registered trade mark must have a reputation in India and the use of the mark without due cause would be amounting to taking unfair advantage of or would be detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Rule  22  of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002 provides that for the purposes of registration of trade marks, goods and services shall be classified in the manner specified in the Fourth Schedule. Clearly, registration of trademarks is in relation to specified goods or services. Goods and services have been classified. It is obvious that, prima facie, goods falling under one class would be different from goods falling under another class. Ordinarily, when registration of a trade mark is granted under one class of goods, it does not cover goods of another class.",

The defendant does not have a registered trade mark in respect of goods falling under class 6 of the said schedule. However, as things stand today2, the defendant is the registetred proprietor of the mark “RANATOR” w.e.f. 26.04.2001 in respect of “Buliding materials (steels)” falling under class 193. Whether the registration is liable to be cancelled, as alleged by the plaintiff, or not, as contended by the defendant, is not a matter for consideration before this court. For the present, in view of section 31 of the said Act, the registration of the trade mark is prima facie evidence of its validity. So, considering the defendant's registration to be valid, for the time being, it must be kept in mind that the mark RANATOR is registered in class 19 and not class 6. The plaintiff has brought this suit claiming its exclusive right to the use of the trade mark RANA in relation to “steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders” falling under class 6 of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks Rules, 2002. The defendant, admittedly, does not have any registration in class 6 (its registration being under class 19).

It is obvious, that it is the plaintiff's statutory right which requires protection and not the defendant's improper use of the mark RANA TOR in relation to steel rolled products, CTD bars, angles, flats, rounds, channels and girders falling under class 6. The balance of convenience is clearly in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. Furthermore, in an infringement action, when the plaintiff has demonstrated that it has a prima facie case and also that the balance of convenience lies in its favour, not granting an interim injunction restraining the defendant from further infringing the plaintiff's registered trade mark would result in causing irreparable injury to the plaintiff.”",

Whether the registration is liable to be cancelled or not is not a matter for consideration before this Court and for the present, in view of Section 31 of the Act, registration of the trademark is prima facie evidence of its validity in favour of the Defendants.

Before resolving the conundrum, it would be useful to refer to the judgment in S. Syed Mohideen (Supra), a reading of which shows the settled position of law that a suit for passing off would lie against the Defendants, despite the registration of their trademark, the essential ingredients of passing off being made out. Relevant paras are as follows:- “28. However, what is stated above is the reflection of Section 28 of the Act when that provision is seen and examined without reference to the other provisions of the Act. It is stated at the cost of repetition that as per this Section owner of registered trade mark cannot sue for infringement of his registered trade mark if the appellant also has the trade mark which is registered. Having said so, a very important question arises for consideration at this stage, namely, whether such a respondent can bring an action against the appellant for passing off invoking the provisions of Section 27(2) of the Act. In other words, what would be the interplay of Section 27(2) and Section 28(3) of the Act is the issue that arises for consideration in the instant case. As already noticed above, the trial court as well as the High Court have granted the injunction in favour of the respondent on the basis of prior user as well as on the ground that the trade mark of the appellant, even if it is registered, would cause deception in the mind of the public at large and the appellant is trying to encash upon, exploit and ride upon on the goodwill of the respondent herein. Therefore, the issue to be determined is as to whether in such a scenario, the provisions of Section 27(2)  would still be available even when the appellant is having registration of the trade mark of which he is using.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

Accordingly, the latter user of the mark/name or in the business cannot misrepresent his business as that of business of the prior right holder. That is the reason why essentially the prior user is considered to be superior than that of any other rights. Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that both prior user and subsequent user are registered proprietors are irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the prior right holder/former user.

The authorities of other common law jurisdictions like England more specifically Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 14th Edn., Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell South Asian Edition recognises the principle that where trade mark action fails, passing off action may still succeed on the same evidence. This has been explained by the learned author by observing the following:  “15-033. A claimant may fail to make out a case of infringement of a trade mark for various reasons and may yet show that by imitating the mark claimed as a trade mark, or otherwise, the defendant has done what is calculated to pass off his goods as those of the claimant.

Applying the principles for determination whether passing off is made out, it is an indisputable position that Plaintiffs are the prior user of the trademarks MINDA and UNO MINDA, since the use of the trademark MINDA (word per se) commenced in the year 1962 and for the device mark from the year 2001. User date of the label UNO MINDA is 01.12.2011. Per contra, as per the case set up by the Defendants, user of the impugned mark commenced from the year 2018 for goods registered under class 04. As averred in the plaint, the UNO MINDA Group is one of the India’s leading manufacturers of automotive components and some of the products manufactured are alternate fuel systems, air filtration systems, brake and fuel hoses, alloy wheels, air brakes, fuel caps, air ducts and washer bottles, wheel covers, sensors, horns, etc. The product range expands across all vehicles, i.e., 2, 3  and 4 wheelers.

It cannot be disputed that Plaintiffs’ trademarks and the impugned mark of the Defendants are not identical. In order to determine whether they are deceptively similar, this Court would rely on the principles formulated by the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (Supra), as aforementioned. In order to avoid prolixity and burden this judgment with several judgments on the aspect of ‘deceptive similarity’, I may only allude to judgment in FDC Limited v. Faraway Foods Pvt. Ltd., 2021 SCC OnLine Del 1539, where this Court has culled out the principles premised on judicial precedents. The principles that emerged to the extend relevant to this case are: (a) class of customers who would purchase the product; (b) the look/appearance and sound of the trademarks as well as the nature of goods including surrounding circumstances; (c) confusion refers to  the state of mind of a customer who, on seeing the mark, thinks that it differs from the mark on the goods which he had previously bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection and the question is thus one of first impression; (d) the test is from the point of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection to see how a purchaser would react to the trademark, the association which he would form and how he would connect the trademarks with goods he is likely to purchase; (e) the resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in idea; (f) the whole word/mark is to be considered as an ordinary man would not split a word or name into its components and would go by overall structural and phonetic similarity of the mark; and (g) the Court is required to examine whether the essential features of the Plaintiff’s mark are to be found in the Defendant’s mark.",

In this regard it would be useful to refer to the case of Ruston & Hornsby  Ltd. v. The Zamindara Engineering Co., (1969) 2 SCC 727, where the Court found that there was deceptive resemblance between the words RUSTON and the mark RUSTAM and negated the contention that the word INDIA added to Respondent’s trademark RUSTAM was of any consequence, albeit in the context of infringement. In Laxmikant V. Patel v.  Chetanbhai Shah and Another, (2002) 3 SCC 65 the Supreme Court held that it is the word ‘Muktajivan’ which makes distinctive the business name of the Plaintiff, i.e., ‘Muktajivan Colour Lab’ and addition of the prefix QSS as an adjective could not be a defence by the Defendant against passing off.",

                        "content": "Two cases which in my view are closest in facts to the present case are Greaves Cotton Limited v. Mr. Mohammad Rafi & Ors., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 2596 and Prem Ratan Rathi & Ors. v. Ashish Iron Trading Co. & Anr., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 3649. In Greaves Cotton (Supra) the mark ‘GREAVES’ was the essential and prominent feature of Plaintiff’s trade name, corporate name and business style and the trademark GREAVES was the surname of the founder of Plaintiff’s predecessor. The Supreme Court observed that by using the words ‘GREAVES INDIA’ Defendant No. 1 had lifted and adopted and whole of the registered trademark of the Plaintiff and mere use of the word ‘INDIA’ would make no difference, since the word GREAVES was the essential and main component of the trademark ‘GREAVES INDIA’. Use of the word INDIA as a suffix and not as a prefix is also strong indicator that the Defendant wanted to encash upon the popularity, goodwill and reputation of the word GREAVES though even if it was used as prefix, it would be infringing. It was also observed that GREAVES is not a dictionary word and comes from the surname of the founder of the Plaintiff and neither deletion of a part of a registered trademark nor addition of a prefix or suffix to it would validate the use by an unlicensed user. On this basis, not only infringement but the issue of passing off was decided in favour of the Plaintiff. In Prem Ratan Rathi (supra), Plaintiff was using the trademark ‘RATHI’ and the Defendants had adopted an identical trademark by adding a prefix GOLDEN. Plaintiff succeeded in its action for infringement and passing off, despite the Defendants’ defence that word RATHI is a common word derived from the name of a village and that the mark is distinguishable by the prefix ‘GOLDEN’. Reference may also be made to a judgment in B.K.  Engineering v. U.B.H.I. Enterprises (Regd.) Ludhiana, AIR 1985 Del. 210, where this Court faced with rival trademarks B.K. and B.K.-81, observed that the Defendants’ addition of ‘81’ to Plaintiff’s mark was a mere garnishing, though even the altered name is likely to mislead. The Defendants’ product will deceive people into thinking that their goods are those of the Plaintiffs. Essence of the law of passing off is competition between traders and if Defendants are not injuncted there will a real risk of injury to the reputation of the Plaintiffs.",

                        "content": "I may usefully allude to para 33 of the judgment in Prem Ratan Rathi (supra), as the same analogy would apply to the present case. In the present case Plaintiffs are selling their products under the trademark MINDA with various prefixes such as SPARK MINDA and UNO MINDA. The word MINDA forms an essential part of Plaintiffs’ trademarks and Defendants prima facie cannot claim any right to use the said mark with or without suffixes or prefixes, as that is likely to cause confusion amongst the purchasers. Para 33 is as follows:- “33. The defendant no. 2 in its written statement claims that the word RATHI is a common word and that the name was adopted by them because the great grandfather of the promoter/director of the defendant no. 2 was a resident of Rathi Vas village in Haryana. However no evidence has been placed on record to prove the said contention. Further, applying the ratio in the Greaves Cotton Case (supra), the defendants' use of the word ‘GOLDEN’ before the mark of the plaintiff ‘RATHI’ does not entitle them to use the impugned mark. The plaintiff's mark ‘RATHI’ is the essential part of their registered trademark and has been in use since the year 1980 as proved in Issues No. 1 and 2. Further, it is also seen from the newspaper clippings of the advertisements of the plaintiff's products placed on record, that they sell the products under the trademark ‘RATHI’ along with suffixes like  ‘TOR’ and ‘THERMEX’, thus bearing the marks ‘RATHI TOR’ and ‘RATHI THERMEX’. Furthermore, it is stated by defendant no. 2 in its written statement that the plaintiffs are also selling their products under the names ‘RATHI EUROTEM’ and ‘RATHI PRAGATI’. Therefore it is clear to me that the word ‘RATHI’ forms an essential part of the plaintiff's trademark and thus, the defendants do not have the right to use the said word with any suffixes or prefixes. Issue No. 7 is decided in favour of the plaintiff.”",

                        "content": "Another crucial question arises in the present case as to why the Defendants chose the word MINDA as a part of their trademark albeit with a suffix UTO. The subtle explanation rendered by the Defendants is that MINDA is a common surname in the country and UNO and SPARK are common English words and that MINDA is the name of a village in Rajasthan, where the forefathers of the Defendants (not specified who) lived. Suffice would it be to state that there is no material on record to substantiate the said plea, contrasted to the stand of the Plaintiffs and prima facie shown to be correct, as to the origin of their trademark. The explanation of the Defendants, in my view, in choosing the impugned trademark is implausible, farfetched and wholly unconvincing and is designed to encash upon the pronounced and prominent reputation of the Plaintiffs. In view of this, in my prima facie view there is deceptive similarity in the rival trademarks as well as dishonest adoption by the Defendants. It is interesting to note the contention of the Plaintiffs that while the registration of the Defendants in class 04 with respect to the trademark MINDA UTO is ‘MINDAUTO’, i.e., as a single word, Defendants have been using the same as two words ‘MINDA UTO’. The intent behind separating the two words is perhaps with a view to lay more emphasis on the word MINDA, so as to encash on the formidable reputation and enormous  goodwill of the Plaintiffs and is in my prima facie view malicious and mischievous.",

Where a trader uses the name or the mark or sign deceptively similar to that of the second trader in relation to goods marketed by the former even though it may not be the same goods or the same type of goods as produced by the second trader, yet a question of passing off may arise.

In the meantime, the defendants may go on using deceptively similar mark in trade and marketing their goods representing or giving an impression as if the said goods are produced by the plaintiff-company.

Consequently, there was no question of any deception being practised on the purchaser of foam materials in the market. This argument loses sight of an important feature viz., how would a lay customer know in the first place that the plaintiff was not producing foam or foam material? How would the customers know that Bata were not producing foam? It is well known that the name represented makers of shoes and analogous products, but a question would also arise in the mind of the lay customers whether Bata were also producing foam. Who is going to answer this question? Does an ordinary customer ask the seller as to whose product it is? The answer generally is in the negative.

As Lord Greene M.R. said:-‘passing off may occur in cases where the Plaintiff do not in fact deal in the offending goods’.

It is a matter of common knowledge that automobile spare parts, lubricants and grease are sold from the same shops and therefore, the trade channels are identical and the consumer base is the same. This Court draws strength from the judgment of the Bombay High Court in H.M. Saraiya and Ors. (Supra), where the  alternate contention of the Plaintiffs was that even if it is held by the Court that Plaintiffs have accrued no reputation in their brand ‘Ajanta’ in respect of their goods, i.e., toothpaste still once the reputation is established in the allied product, i.e., toothbrush, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunction on the principle that Defendant cannot sell a cognate or allied product and should be injuncted in a passing off action. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968 the Bombay High Court observed as follows:- “58. In the present case we are not concerned with the super brand status or universal status of any brand because it is not even the case of the plaintiffs that their brand has acquired any such super status so as to entitle the plaintiffs to protect their transborder and trans product reputation. The case of the plaintiffs is that the goods relating to the same field and/or in any event a cognate and allied products aforesaid are so similar products that it is likely to result in confusion in the minds of public. In my opinion, the principle of cognate and allied product is very much in existence and has been well recognised both by the learned author Kerly in the aforesaid paras as well as various judgments which are cited before me by the plaintiffs. In the case of Corn Products Refining Co. (supra), the Apex Court was dealing with the brand name 'Glucovita' glucouse vita in respect of glucose powder mixed with vitamin and other product being glucose biscuits. The Apex Court as far back as in 1960 held that even though the goods are different but by virtue of fact that glucose powder is used in manufacture of biscuits and, therefore, the person is entitled to injunction though the goods are not identical.”",

Concealment of material facts or suppression by the Plaintiffs is a ground which the Court ought to examine at the stage of an application  under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, as no party can come to the Court with unclean hands. In Dahiben v. Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali (Gajra) Dead Through Legal Representatives and Others, 2020 (7) SCC 366, the Supreme Court held that the Trial Court rightly exercised the power under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, once it was found that there was an omission of the date of the registered sale-deed, which had an impact on the decision with respect to limitation.

Admittedly, Defendant No.1’s website is specifically targeted towards Indian  customers, including Delhi, as averred in paragraphs 30, 31, 33, 37, 44 to 52 and 60 of the plaint and thus, cause of action has arisen within the territorial limits of this Court under Section 20(c) CPC; (c) this Court in Burger King Corporation v. Techchand Shewakramani & Ors., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 10881 and Exxon Mobil Corporation v. Exoncorp Private Limited, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 9193, has held that in a case involving trademark, infringement happens when a person ‘uses’ the mark in the course of the trade and ‘use’ would include ‘offer for sale’. As Defendant No. 1’s website offers counterfeit products for sale to customers at Delhi, suit is maintainable before this Court and applying the law propounded in  Millennium & Copthorne International Limited (supra), Banyan Tree Holding (P) Limited (supra) and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.

Plaintiffs have no affiliation/association/economic link with the said Company or any of its beneficiaries and plea of international exhaustion is not available to Defendant No. 2; and (j) principles under Section 30(3) of the Act, which embody the principle of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to Section 30(4) of the Act and there cannot be a more ‘legitimate’ reason than being a registered proprietor of a trademark, whose statutory and common law rights are being violated by the Defendants.",

In order to test the claim of the Plaintiffs with respect to jurisdiction under Section 20(c) CPC, it needs to be examined as to what constitutes ‘cause of action’, in respect of a suit alleging violation of intellectual property rights, more particularly, a claim for infringement and passing off, as in the present case. This question has been answered by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Burger King Corporation (supra), relying on the judgments in Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (supra) and Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and relevant paras are as follows:- “19. What constitutes cause of action in the context of a suit alleging violation of rights in a trade mark, would therefore be the question. In a case involving trade mark infringement, infringement happens when a person “uses in the course of trade” any mark without the owner's consent. Thus, use of a mark is the cause of action in an infringement as also in a passing off action. If use takes place in a territory where the suit is filed, that Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit. When there is use of a mark, there is a cause of action to sue, where the use takes place. it is relevant to point out that “use” of a trademark as per Section 2(2)(c) of the TM Act is as under:  “(2) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, any reference - …  (c)  to the use of a mark- (i)  in relation to goods, shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark upon, or in any  physical or in any other relation whatsoever, to such goods;  (ii)  in relation to services, shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark as or as part of any statement about the availability, provision or performance of such services;”",

This position is maintained under the 1994 Act which, in section 10(4) and (5), follows the permissive provisions of Article 5(3) of the TM Directive in indentifying the various activities which constitute use of a sign for the purposes of the infringement provisions.  13-33  It is an infringement to use an offending sign on business papers on in advertising: this has always been the law. But with the wider definition of use including oral use of a trade mark it will now be an infringement to advertise using an offending mark by, for example, radio or through oral use of the mark by salesman.”",

Additionally, Defendant No. 1 operates its website, which specifically targets consumers based in Delhi and though the orders placed by the purchasers are fulfilled by Defendant No. 2, the transaction is entered into by the consumers at Delhi. Even assuming for the sake of argument that Plaintiffs do not have an outlet in Delhi, in this day and time, in my opinion, Defendants’ conduct of business through a website, where they offer goods for sale, targeting customers in Delhi, thereby raising queries, would confer jurisdiction on this Court as there is ‘offer for sale’ and consequently ‘use’ of the trademark, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Plaintiffs have filed a screenshot of the website of Defendant No. 1, showing availability of the products, alleged to be counterfeit and the same are accessible not only globally but also in India, including Delhi. The fact that the goods offered on this website are accessible to customers at Delhi and are also delivered, when an order is placed, is reflected from the ‘location PIN code’ appearing on the screenshot of the website:- Therefore, Plaintiffs are right in contending that the impugned products are being offered for sale in Delhi and this Court finds that they are also being sold and delivered to the customers at Delhi. In this context, this Court also relies on Section 29(6)(b) of the Act, which provides that a mere ‘offer for sale’ of an infringing product would constitute a cause of action for a claim for infringement under Section 29 of the Act.

This Court holds that jurisdiction of the forum court does not get attracted merely on the basis of interactivity of the website which is accessible in the forum state. The degree of the interactivity apart, the nature of the activity permissible and whether it results in a commercial transaction has to be examined. For the ‘effects’ test to apply, the Plaintiff must necessarily plead and show prima facie that the specific targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state. For the purposes of a passing off or an infringement action (where the plaintiff is not located within the jurisdiction of the court), the injurious effect on the Plaintiff's business, goodwill or reputation within the forum state as a result of the Defendant's website being accessed in the forum state would have to be shown. Naturally therefore, this would require the presence of the Plaintiff in the forum state and not merely the possibility of such presence in the future. Secondly, to show that an injurious effect has been felt by the Plaintiff it would have to be shown that viewers in the forum state were specifically targeted. Therefore the ‘effects’ test would have to be applied in conjunction with the “sliding scale” test to determine if the forum court has jurisdiction to try a suit concerning internet based disputes.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

This is consistent with the law laid down in Cybersell and reiterated later in Toys R Us. It is also consistent with the application of the ‘tighter’ version of the ‘effects’ test which is ‘targeting’. In any action for passing off or infringement, it would have to be shown that the Defendant by using its mark intended to pass off its goods as that of the Plaintiff's. A mere hosting of a website which can be accessible from anyone from within the jurisdiction of the court is not sufficient for this  purpose. Also a mere posting of an advertisement by the Defendant depicting its mark on a passive website which does not enable the Defendant to enter into any commercial transaction with the viewer in the forum state cannot satisfy the requirement of giving rise to a cause of action in the forum state. Even an interactive website, which is not shown to be specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions, will not result in the court of the forum state having jurisdiction. In sum, for the purposes of Section 20 (c) CPC, in order to show that some part of the cause of action has arisen in the forum state by the use of the internet by the Defendant, the Plaintiff will have to show prima facie that the said website, whether euphemistically termed as “passive plus” or “interactive” was specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions. The Plaintiff would have to plead this and produce material to prima facie show that some commercial transaction using the website was entered into by the Defendant with a user of its website within the forum state and that the specific targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm to the Plaintiff within the forum state.

The stand of Defendant No. 2 is that it is not running a website by itself and in any case certainly not a website that offers goods carrying the trademarks of the Plaintiffs and that Defendant No. 1 runs a website on which customers place orders albeit Defendant No. 2 fulfils the orders, restricted to USA. In my view, the distinction sought to be brought out by Defendant No. 2 is inconsequential, insofar as the territorial jurisdiction of this Court is concerned, inasmuch as the commercial relationship between the Defendants is undisputed, as noted  above. Court finds strength in this view from the judgment of this Court in Millennium & Copthorne International Limited (supra), where it was held that if the Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit owing to Defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and enabling Defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business at Delhi, there was no reason to hold that it will not be so where the Defendants, instead of hosting their own interactive website, avail the services of third party websites to carry on business at Delhi and there is no rationale for carving out such a distinction. Relevant para of the judgment is as follows:  “24. In continuation of what was held by the Division Bench in World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., I may state that the mode of booking/reserving rooms and other facilities particularly of dining therein, in hotels/resorts/spas, has changed over the years with maximum number of bookings/reservations being made through such third party websites, so much so that the rates available on the third party websites are also found to be considerably lower than the rates offered through traditional mode of agents or offices in major cities. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that much of the volume of businesses of hotels is now through such third party websites, in comparison to the business through direct bookings and/or through travel agents. Thus, if the Courts at Delhi will have jurisdiction over subject matter of suit owing to defendants having interactive website accessible at Delhi and enabling defendants situated outside Delhi to carry on business at Delhi, I see no reason to hold that it will not be so where the defendants, instead of hosting its own interactive website, avails the service of third party websites to carry on business at Delhi. There is no rationale for carving out such a distinction. Certainly, making a booking/reservation, even if the same does not subsequently materialise, is part of carrying on business, inasmuch as the hotel which has taken the booking, even if has not received any payment, being unable to turn back a customer if shows up in pursuance to such booking. The defendants, by  showing on their websites, their location to be at Delhi, are also found to be attracting and luring the customers, otherwise intending to visit Delhi, into believing that the hotels and resorts of the defendants are at Delhi, though actually, territorially speaking, outside Delhi. The defendants, cannot be permitted to take different stand/position while carrying on business than before this Court. In any case, such acts of the defendants amount to specifically targeting the viewers at Delhi, within the meaning of Banyan Tree Holding (P) Ltd. supra.”",

Let us now apply these principles to the type of transaction over the internet, which we have explained above. The website of the appellant/plaintiff refers to various goods and services. It is not an offer but an invitation to an offer, just as a menu in a restaurant. The invitation, if accepted by a customer in Delhi, becomes an offer made by the customer in Delhi for purchasing the goods “advertised” on the website of the appellant/plaintiff. When, through the mode of the software and the browser, the transaction is confirmed and payment is made to the appellant/plaintiff through its website, the appellant/plaintiff accepts the offer of the customer at Delhi. Since the transaction between the two takes place instantaneously, the acceptance by the appellant/plaintiff is instantaneously communicated to its customer through the internet at Delhi. Therefore, in such a case, part of the cause of action would arise in Delhi.",

What we are examining is whether the third condition specified in Dhodha House (supra) is satisfied or not. In other words, if the contracts and/or transactions entered into between the appellant/plaintiff on the one hand and its customers are being  concluded in Delhi, can it not be said that the essential part of the business of the appellant/plaintiff, insofar as its transactions with customers in Delhi are concerned, takes place in Delhi? The offers are made by customers at Delhi. The offers are subject to confirmation/acceptance of the appellant/plaintiff through its website. The money would emanate or be paid from Delhi. Can it not then be considered that the appellant/plaintiff is, to a certain extent, carrying on business at Delhi? In our view, it would be so. Because of the advancements in technology and the rapid growth of new models of conducting business over the internet, it is possible for an entity to have a virtual presence in a place which is located at a distance from the place where it has a physical presence. The availability of transactions through the website at a particular place is virtually the same thing as a seller having shops in that place in the physical world. Let us assume for the sake of argument that the appellant/plaintiff had a shop in Delhi from where it sold its various goods and services. In that case, it could not be denied that the plaintiff carried on business in Delhi. This is apart from the fact that the appellant/plaintiff may also have been regarded as having voluntarily resided in Delhi. When the shop in the ‘physical sense’ is replaced by the ‘virtual’ shop because of the advancement of technology, in our view, it cannot be said that the appellant/plaintiff would not carry on business in Delhi.”",

The relief sought in the present suit is for infringement and passing off against the Defendants and in terms of the provisions of the Act as well as judgments alluded to above, offer to sell even on an interactive website targeting the customers in a particular State is enough to grant jurisdiction of the Court as well as to give cause of action to the Plaintiffs. A perusal of the ‘Terms and Conditions for the Global Store’ shows that the same apply when a customer purchases products from the Amazon Global Store and thereupon he acknowledges that the sale takes place in USA and is subject to laws and regulations of USA and that the State of Washington will have the exclusive jurisdiction. As rightly contended on behalf of the Plaintiffs, these Terms and Conditions purely govern relationships between a buyer and a seller, i.e., parties to the contract and do not bind the Plaintiffs who have filed the present case for violation of their statutory and common law rights against the Defendants for selling counterfeit products using their registered trademarks. Additionally, it is the offer for sale within the jurisdiction of this Court  which is the trigger for a cause of action, which may or may not be followed by an actual sale of the infringing product and therefore, it is irrelevant whether the sale takes place in India or outside. Since it is ‘offer for sale’, which is the cause of action and constitutes infringement under the provisions of the Act, the argument on behalf of the Defendants with respect to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is also misconceived. Insofar as judgments in Dahiben (supra) and Xavier D’Souza & Anr. (supra) are concerned, the proposition laid down in the said judgments cannot be disputed, however, these judgments are inapplicable to the present case. In Dahiben (supra), Plaintiffs had deliberately failed to mention the date of the registered sale-deed, which omission had an impact on the limitation for filing the suit. The Court found the omission to be deliberate and since it had impact on the limitation within which the suit could be filed, the Court upheld the order of the Trial Court rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.",

Defendant filed an application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC for rejection of the plaint. After analysing the matter, the Court came to a conclusion that the Plaintiff was a party to the sale deed and a businessman and it was unbelievable that he was oblivious of the document that was executed and therefore, cannot be permitted to seek a declaration after 18 years when the suit was time barred. The Court also found that Plaintiff had suppressed that date of the award and receipt of compensation and had made efforts to get relief from the Court by  suppressing the dates of various documents.

Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Anr., 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5172, the Court has recognized that principle of exhaustion under Section 30(3) and (4) of the Act is of international exhaustion. There cannot be any debate on the principle of international exhaustion of rights under the Act, which has been created to prevent the owner of a registered trademark from receiving consideration twice for the sale of same goods. However, suffice would it be to state that this argument cannot be a ground to reject the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC and at best, could be a defence of the Defendants on merits to the Plaintiffs’ suit. Even otherwise, at this stage, no proof of purported procurement or purchase has been filed by Defendant No. 2 to establish even prima facie that it has procured the infringing goods from a lawful source in USA, i.e., from BHPC Associates LLC, as alleged. Responding to the contention, Plaintiffs have sought to clarify that they have no affiliation or association or even an economic link with the said entity anywhere in the world and nor are they the beneficiaries of any transaction made by the Defendants with the said entity in relation to the infringing products. Learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs has also rightly argued that principles under Section 30(3) of the Act, which embody the principle of international exhaustion of rights, are subject to sub-Section (4) of  Section 30 and there can be no greater reason which can be termed as ‘legitimate’ than being the registered proprietor of the trademark.",

                        "content": "Principles that govern adjudication under Order VII Rule 11 CPC are well-settled. The Court is required to examine the plaint on a demurrer and see if the plaint sets out a cause of action which is triable by the Court. No doubt, as rightly contended by learned Senior Counsel for Defendant No. 2 and as held in Nawal Singh (supra), the documents filed along with the plaint can be seen, however, the Court cannot base its adjudication on the defence in the suit. In this context, I may refer to para 27 from the judgment in M/s RSPL Limited v. Mukesh Sharma and Another, 2016 SCC Online Del 4285, which is as follows:- “27. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name ‘GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY’. In paragraph 37 of the plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit. But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by ‘conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name’. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's  goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the  appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.”",

It is also averred that products are sold through the websites of their licensees. Plaintiffs have also averred that Defendant No. 1 is, through its website, offering the counterfeit products for sale which can be purchased by customers in Delhi and thus, this Court has jurisdiction, both under Section 134(2) of the Act and Section 20(c) of CPC. At this stage, the Court cannot examine the merits of the matter or take into account the defence set up by the Defendants albeit it is possible that Plaintiffs may not succeed finally in the suit.

Ltd. which decision was followed by this Court in (2011) 47 PTC 337 (Delhi) Consitex S.A. Vs. Kamini Jain & Ors. it was held:  “9. The phonetic similarity between 'Anchor' on the one hand and 'Encore', on the other, is striking. The two marks are phonetically, visually and structurally similar. The overall impression conveyed by a mark as a whole, has to be assessed in evaluating whether the mark of the Defendant is deceptively similar to the mark of the Plaintiff. Phonetic similarity constitutes an important index of whether a mark bears a deceptive or misleading similarity to another. The phonetic structure indicates how the rival marks ring in the ears. Courts in a country such as ours whose culture is enriched by a diversity of languages and scripts have to consider how the rival marks are spelt and pronounced in languages in which they are commonly used. Counsel for the Defendant submits before the Court that while 'Encore' is a word of French origin, 'Anchor' is a word of English usage and the pronounciation of the two words must differ. The submission misses the point. The case before the Court is not about how an Englishman would pronounce 'Anchor' or a Frenchman would pronounce 'Encore'.  The Court must consider the usage of words in India, the manner in which a word would be written in Indian languages and last but not least, the similarity of pronounciation if the rival marks were to be pronounced in languages prevalent in the country where the marks are used. The manner in which the 'a' as in 'anchor' is pronounced by an Englishman on Notting Hill may well appear to a discerning traveller to be distinct from a Frenchman's pronounciation of the 'e' in 'encore' on a fashionable by lane near Champs Elysees. That is no defence to an action in our Courts for passing off: For the ordinary consumer in Ahmedabad and her counterpart in Mumbai's shopping streets, the 'a' in 'anchor' and the 'e' in 'encore' are perilously and deceptively similar. The Court must assess the make up of an Indian consumer and, associated with that, the cultural traits that underlie the spelling and Pronounciation of words. The case of the Plaintiff is that in Gujarati as well as in Hindi, there is not even a subtle distinction between the manner in which 'Anchor' and 'Encore' would be pronounced and we find merit in the submission. The overall impact in terms of phonetical usage is one of striking similarity. The test is not whether a customer who wishes to buy the product of the Plaintiff is likely to end up buying the product of the Defendant. The test is whether the ordinary customer is likely to be led to believe that 'Encore' is associated with the mark and the trading style of the Plaintiff. The phonetical, visual and structural get up of the two words is so strikingly similar as to lead to a likelihood of deception. The question of deception is a matter for the Court to determine, particularly at the interlocutory stage. The judgment of the Learned Single Judge has been criticized on the ground that the Court attempted to break up the words contained in the rival marks. We do not share that perception. What the Learned Single Judge has done in the present case is to compare the two rival marks and to emphasize a striking similarity between the marks with reference to the common features of the rival words. That is a permissible exercise and the judgment of the Learned Single Judge does no more than that.”",

Thus, between the two persons who are the registered owners of the trade marks, there is no exclusive right to use the said trade mark against each other, which means this provision gives concurrent right to both the persons to use the registered trade mark in their favour.

As already noticed above, the trial court as well as the High Court have granted the injunction in favour of the respondent on the basis of prior user as well as on the ground that the trade mark of the appellant, even if it is registered, would cause deception in the mind of the public at large and the appellant is trying to encash upon, exploit and ride upon on the goodwill of the respondent herein.

[Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc., (1990) 1 WLR 491 : (1990) 1 All ER 873 (HL)] which is more popularly known as “Jif Lemon” case wherein Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v.

Thus, the passing off action is essentially an action in deceit where the common law rule is that no person is entitled to carry on his or her business on pretext that the said business is of that of another.

Accordingly, the latter user of the mark/name or in the business cannot misrepresent his business as that of business of the prior right holder. That is the reason why essentially the prior user is considered to be superior than that of any other rights. Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that both prior user and subsequent user are registered proprietors are irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the prior right holder/former user.

The authorities of other common law jurisdictions like England more specifically Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 14th Edn., Thomson, Sweet & Maxwell South Asian Edition recognises the principle that where trade mark action fails, passing off action may still succeed on the same evidence. This has been explained by the learned author by observing the following:  “15-033. A claimant may fail to make out a case of infringement of a trade mark for various reasons and may yet show that by imitating the mark claimed as a  trade mark, or otherwise, the defendant has done what is calculated to pass off his goods as those of the claimant.

This has been explained by the learned author as under:  “15-034. Subject to possibly one qualification, nothing in the Trade Marks Act, 1994 affects a trader's right against another in an action for passing off. It is, therefore, no bar to an action for passing off that the trade name, get up or any other of the badges identified with the claimant's business, which are alleged to have been copies or imitated by the defendant, might have been, but are not registered as, trade marks, even though the evidence is wholly addressed to what may be a mark capable of registration. Again, it is no defence to passing off that the defendant's mark is registered. The Act offers advantages to those who register their trade marks, but imposes no penalty upon those who do not. It is equally no bar to an action for passing off that the false representation relied upon is an imitation of a trade mark that is incapable of registration. A passing off action can even lie against a registered proprietor of the mark sued upon. The fact that a claimant is using a mark registered by another party (or even the defendant) does not of itself prevent goodwill being generated by the use of the mark, or prevent such a claimant from relying on such goodwill in an action against the registered proprietor. Such unregistered marks are frequently referred to as  „common law trade marks‟.”",

This has been explained by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co. [Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50 : AIR 1978 Del 250] in the following words: (SCC OnLine Del para 10)  “10. „16. … First is the question of use of the trade mark. Use plays an all-important part. A trader acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a mark is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible character is launched upon the market. Registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater rights than what already existed at common law and at equity without registration. It does, however, facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout „the State and it established the record of facts affecting the right to the mark. Registration itself does not create a trade mark. The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute. Common law rights are left wholly unaffected.‟ [Ed.: As observed in L.D. Malhotra Industries v. Ropi Industries, 1975 SCC OnLine Del 172, para 16.] ”  (emphasis supplied)",

Caltex (India) Ltd., 1965 SCC OnLine Bom 151 : AIR 1969 Bom 24] in which it has been held vide AIR para 32 as follows: (SCC OnLine Bom paras 1 & 2)  “1. A proprietary right in a mark can be [„Iruttukadai Halwa‟] obtained in a number of ways. The mark can be originated by a person, or it can be subsequently acquired by him from somebody else. Our Trade Marks law is based on the English Trade Marks law and the English Acts. The first Trade Marks Act in England was passed in 1875. Even prior thereto, it was firmly established in England that a trader acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade, and that he was entitled to protect such right of property by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a court of law. Then came the English Trade Marks Act of 1875, which was substituted later by later Acts. The English Acts enabled registration of a new mark not till then used with the like consequences which a distinctive mark had prior to the passing of the Acts. The effect of the relevant provision of the English Acts was that registration of a trade mark would be deemed to be equivalent to public user of such mark. Prior to the Acts, one could become a proprietor of a trade mark only by user, but after the passing of the Act of 1875, one could become a proprietor either by user or by registering the mark even prior to its user. He could do the latter after complying with the other requirements of the Act, including the filing of a declaration of his intention to use such mark. See observations of Llyod Jacob, J. in Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In re [Vitamins Ltd.'s Application, In re, (1956) 1 WLR 1 : (1955) 3 All ER 827 : 1956 RPC 1] at RPC p. 12, and particularly the following: (WLR p. 10)  „… A proprietary right in a mark sought to be registered can be obtained in a number of ways.  The mark can be originated by a person or can be acquired, but in all cases it is necessary that the person putting forward the application should be in possession of some proprietary right which, if questioned, can be substantiated.‟",

Thus, we hold that registration is merely a recognition of the rights pre-existing in common law and in case of conflict between the two registered proprietors, the evaluation of the better rights in common law is essential as the common law rights would enable the court to determine whose rights between the two registered proprietors are better and superior in common law which have been recognised in the form of the registration by the Act.”",

Indisputably, the plaintiff company had office at Neb Sarai at the time of filing of the suit, so if a company has a sales office even if not a registered office, it would be difficult to dispute that plaintiff company carried on its business at that place as well. In this view of the matter support can be obtained from L'oreal Vs. Dushyant Shah, the decision of our High Court reported as MANU/DE/4389/2011. Quia Timet action is when plaintiff apprehends infringement even if defendant had not commenced operation, the right of the plaintiff to maintain cause of action on account of apprehension of infringement of its trademark is well known. In Saurav Agro' case, referred above by the plaintiff, in para 77, Pfizer products Inc. Vs. Rajesh Chopra & Ors was referred wherein also it was observed that the threat of selling the  offending goods in Delhi would confirm the jurisdiction in the court in Delhi to entertain a suit claiming an injunction in respect thereof and in so far as Order VII Rule 10 is concerned, assuming that whatever is stated in the plaint is correct, one would have to assume that the threat of the defendant to sell and offer for sale the offending goods in Delhi was also correct.

It is evident from the above observations that the interpretation given to the expression “carries on business” in the context of a defendant under section 20 of the Code has also been employed in the context of a plaintiff under the said sections 134(2) and 62(2). Thus, in addition to the places where suits could be filed under section 20 of the Code, the plaintiff can also institute a suit under the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957, as the case may be, by taking advantage of the provisions of section 134(2) or section 62(2), respectively. Both the latter provisions are in pari materia. Under these provisions four situations can be contemplated in the context of the plaintiff being a corporation (which includes a company). First of all, is the case where the plaintiff has a sole office.  In such a case, even if the cause of action has arisen at a different place, the plaintiff can institute a suit at the place of the sole office. Next is the case where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and a subordinate or branch office at another place and the cause of action has arisen at the place of the principal office. In such a case, the plaintiff may sue at the place of the principal office but cannot sue at the place of the subordinate office. The third case is where the plaintiff has a principal office at one place and the cause of action has arisen at the place where its subordinate office is located. In this eventuality, the plaintiff would be deemed to carry on business at the place of his subordinate office and not at the place of the principal office. Thus, the plaintiff could sue at the place of the subordinate office and cannot sue (under the scheme of the provisions of section 134(2) and 62(2)) at the place of the principal office. The fourth case is where the cause of action neither arises at the place of the principal office nor at the place of the subordinate office but at some other place. In this case, the plaintiff would be deemed to carry on business at the place of its principal office and not at the place of the subordinate office. And, consequently, it could institute a suit at the place of its principal office but not at the place of its subordinate office.

But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by ‘conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name’. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the  plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

Bealey [(1885) 28 Ch D 688: 54 LJ Ch 424: 52 LT 541], Mr Justice Pearson explained the law as to actions quia timet as follows:  “There are at least two necessary ingredients for a quia timet action. There must, if no actual damage is proved, be proof of imminent danger, and there must also be proof that the apprehended damage will, if it comes, be very substantial. I should almost say it must be proved that it will be irreparable, because, if the danger is not proved to be so imminent that no one can doubt that, if the remedy is delayed the damage will be suffered, I think it must be shown that, if the damage does occur at any time, it will come in such a way and under such circumstances that it will be impossible for the plaintiff to protect himself against it if relief is denied to him in a quia timet action”.”",

The registration of copyright in respect of artistic works is, thus, founded on the basis of the NOC issued by the Trademark Office. Recently, this Court in C.O.(COMM.IPD-CR) 1/2021 titled Abhishek Kumar v. Union of India Through Registrar of Copyrights in order dated 30th August, 2022 has summed up the legal position under section 45 of the Act and held as under:  “15. Considering now the fact that the search certificate has been cancelled and the Petitioner’s first application for the trademark has also been revived, the copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3 can no longer stand. Obtaining an NOC under the proviso to Section 45 of the Act is compulsory in order to obtain registration of copyright. Clearly, there seems to be some misconduct indulged into by Respondent No.3 which has resulted in this entire sequence of events leading up to the grant of copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3. The NOC having been cancelled, the first trademark application of the Petitioner having been revived and no reply having been filed by Respondent No.3 to contest the present petition as also the mark of the Petitioner and the artistic work of Respondent No.3 being identical, the copyright registration in favour of Respondent No.3 would be an entry which is wrongly made and wrongly remaining on the register in terms of Section 50 of the Act…”",

                        "content": "In the present case, clearly, a perusal of the copyright registrations and the packaging used by both the parties itself shows that the labels are almost identical in nature. The Court has also seen the physical packagings which have been handed over to the Court and there is no doubt whatsoever that the Respondent No.3’s packaging/label is a substantial imitation of the Petitioner’ packaging. The Petitioner’s registration of copyright is dated 27th February, 2018 and the Respondent No.3’s NOC was issued on 18th June, 2019. Further, the copyright registration of Respondent No.3 dated 21 October, 2019 is subsequent to that of the Petitioner’s copyright registration. In the opinion of the Court, the two competing registrations, which are almost identical to each other, cannot be sustained under the Copyright Act. Respondent No.3’s artistic work is a substantial and colourable imitation of  the Petitioner’s artistic work. In any event, the Registrar of the Trademarks, has vide its order dated 23rd March, 2021 has given the following findings:  “  On 27/11/2017 the above named Applicant through their Attorney M/s. Tyagi Vertifications, Delhi filed an application for search and certificate under Section 45(1) of the Copyright Act, 1957 vide C.C.No.87288 seeking NOC in relation to artistic label ASLI KESARI CHAI with device of \"woman plucking tea leaves”. The office conducted a search and issued a Search Report (NOC) for the artistic label applied under TM-C on 18/06/2019.  The Objector vide their letter dated 27/12/2019 filed a cancellation request under Rule 22(2) of the Trade Marks Rules, 2017 objecting to the NOC issued under Copyright Certificate No.87288. The said objection was forwarded to the Applicant for comments. The Applicant has not given any comments to the said objection letter. Thereafter the matter was fixed for hearing on 16/03/2021 when Mr. Rajat Agarwal, Advocate appeared for the objector and none appeared for the Applicant.  The Advocate for the Objector explained the facts. The Objector has filed copy of registration certificate in trademark no.3035105 in Class 30 and copyright registration certificate vide registration no.A-124161/2018 dated 27/02/2018. The objectors’ contention is that the impugned NOC under C.C. No.827288 for the label ASLI KESARI CHAI has been obtained fraudulently by the Applicant. The Applicant's impugned label ASLI KESARI CHAI with device of woman plucking tea leaves, the colour scheme and get up of the packaging is identical and similar to the Objectors’ copyright registration for artistic label HIGHGRON KESARI CHAI.  I carefully compared the NOC issued to the Applicant and rival artistic label of the objector. In both the artistic labels the colour of the packaging is identical, the device of woman plucking leaves is also identical, the manner of presentation of the word ASLI KESARI CHAI and HIGHGRON is deceptively similar. Both the labels compared as a whole shows mere re-production of the objector's HIGHGRON label by the Applicant for the artistic label KESARI CHAI.  In view of the similarity and intentionally adopting the artistic label of the objectors' to gain benefit of the copyright, the NOC issued in C.C.No.87288 is liable to be cancelled.  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that objection filed by the Objector is hereby allowed and search certificate issued under TMR-NOC-C.C.No.87288 dated 18/06/2019 is hereby cancelled as per Rule 22(2) of Trade Marks Rules, 2017.  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that there shall be no order as to costs.”",

After considering the entire matter, the Court had directed as under:- i.  The delay in filing of oppositions by all four Petitioners in respect of the applications which they intend to oppose as set out above, is condoned. They shall now file their oppositions by 31st March, 2022, either online or offline.

(C) IPD 103/2021 & W.P.(C) 1907/2022 shall stand suspended during this period, till the decision is taken on the oppositions, as specified herein.  iii.  In W.P.(C) IPD 4/2022, the registration certificate shall not be issued to the Applicant, till the decision is taken on the oppositions, as specified herein.  iv.  In so far as other trademarks advertised during the pandemic are concerned, the advertised application in respect of which the four month limitation period would have expired after 15th March, 2020, the limitation period in terms of the orders of the Supreme Court shall be extended for filing oppositions to the said applications, until the expiry of 90 days from 1st March, 2022, i.e. till 30th May, 2022. Compliance of this direction shall be ensured by the respective Controllers in-charge of Oppositions across the five offices of CGPDTM, in case any emails are received by prospective opponents/ their agents/ counsels who wish to file oppositions. During this period, if any email is received by the CGPDTM from the opponents/their agents/counsels, the office of the CGPDTM shall enable the said opposition to be filed either through online mechanism or through physical filing. Upon filing of oppositions, the status of the trademark application shall be reflected appropriately on the portal within 48 hours.  v.

In respect of the trademark applications in which no oppositions have been already filed or are received till 30th May, 2022, the said registration certificates shall remain valid and the said applicants shall enjoy their statutory rights in accordance with law.  b.  In respect of those trademark applications where oppositions have already been filed or are filed by 30th May, 2022, the registration certificates shall either not be issued or if already issued, the same shall stand suspended till the oppositions are decided by the office of the CGPDTM.  vi.  In future, whenever emails concerning oppositions are received by the Opposition Section, CGPDTM, the concerned Controller in-charge shall first, ensure that such emails are replied to within a reasonable time, not later than three working days and second, that proper instructions are given by them to the section issuing registration certificates at the CGPDTM/ concerned officials in the Mumbai office, depending upon the correspondence received, so that certificates are not issued while issues relating to opposing the trademark are being raised with the office of the CGPDTM.”",

True,  the decree of the civil court will be on the basis of the conclusions on the other issues in the suit. But to permit the issue of rectification, once abandoned, to be resurrected at the option of the party who had chosen not to pursue the same at an earlier point of time would be to open the doors to reopening of decrees/orders that have attained finality in law.

If the right under Sections 46/56 of the 1958 Act is to subsist even in such a situation, the possible uncertainty and possible anarchy may well be visualised. This is why the legislature by enacting Section 111 of the 1958 Act has mandated that the issue of invalidity which would go to the root of the matter should be decided in the first instance and a decision on the same would bind the parties before the civil court. Only if the same is abandoned or decided against the party raising it that the suit will proceed in respect of the other issues, if any.

NHPC Limited, (2020) 4 SCC 234, the Supreme Court has reiterated that the judgments of the Court are not to be construed as statues, neither are they to be read as Euclid’s theorems. All observations made must be read in the context in which they appear. The judgment must be read as a whole to reveal the true ratio of the judgment. In this regard, this Court may quote from the judgment, as under:  “41. This Court has held that judgments of Courts are not to be construed as statutes, neither are they to be read as Euclid's theorems. All observations made must be read in the context in which they appear. This was felicitously put in Amar Nath Om Prakash v. State of Punjab [Amar Nath Om Prakash v. State of Punjab, (1985) 1 SCC 345 : 1985 SCC (Tax) 92] ,  where this Court stated : (SCC pp. 362-63, para 10)  “10. There is one other significant sentence in Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of A.P. [Sreenivasa General Traders v. State of A.P., (1983) 4 SCC 353] with which we must express our agreement, it was said : (SCC p. 377, para 27)  „27. … With utmost respect, these observations of the learned Judge are not to be read as Euclid's theorems, nor as provisions of a statute. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear.‟  We consider it proper to say, as we have already said in other cases, that judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for Judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton [London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton, 1951 AC 737 (HL)] , AC at p. 761 Lord MacDermott observed : (AC p. 761)  „…The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by treating the ipsissima verba of Willes, J., as though they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is not to detract from the great weight to be given to the language actually used by that most distinguished Judge.…‟  In Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd. [Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd., 1970 AC 1004 : (1970) 2 WLR 1140 (HL)] Lord Reid said : (AC p. 1027)  „…Lord Atkin's speech M'Alister (or Donoghue) v. Stevenson [M'Alister (or Donoghue) v. Stevenson, 1932 AC 562 : 101 LJPC 119 : 147 LT 281 (HL)] … is not to be treated as  if it was a statutory definition. It will require qualification in new circumstances.‟  Megarry, J. in Shepherd Homes Ltd. v. Sandham (No. 2) [Shepherd Homes Ltd. v. Sandham (No. 2), (1971) 1 WLR 1062] observed : (WLR p. 1069)  „… One must not, of course, construe even a reserved judgment of even Russell, L.J. as if it were an Act of Parliament.‟  „There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or a judgment as though they were words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case.‟”  (emphasis supplied) 42. More recently, this Court in Union of India v. Amrit Lal Manchanda [Union of India v. Amrit Lal Manchanda, (2004) 3 SCC 75 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 662] held as follows : (SCC p. 83, para 15)  “15. Cases involving challenges to orders of detention before and after execution of the order stand on different footings. Courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed. Observations of courts are neither to be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of courts are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their words are not to be interpreted as statutes.”  (emphasis supplied)",
