The mark of the defendant is deceptively similar to that of the plaintiffs. The test to be applied for judging the claim of infringement and passing off is of an unwary consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection. The same, following the judgments of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968 and Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, has been reiterated by the judgment of a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court dated 26.07.2022 in Mondelez India Foods Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. Neeraj Food Products, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 2199, where it has been held as under:  •29. In two seminal judgements of the Supreme Court, the test of infringement and deceptive similarity of competing marks is well settled. The Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968, has observed that the said question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. It was observed that, to such a man, the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them. The relevant extracts from the judgment in Corn Products (supra) are set out below:  •18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is well known that the question whether the two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the court to decide that question. English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word is an English word which to the mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole. So considered, we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from the syllable •co• in the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the other.",

The  Aquamatic case (Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty's Ld.) is a recent case where the test of the commonness of the idea between two marks was applied in deciding the question of similarity between them. Again, in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks we have to approach it from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection.

The relevant extracts of the said judgment, which has been followed in innumerable judgments subsequently, are set out hereinbelow:  •According to Kerly•s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (9th Edition Paragraph 838) •Two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person acquainted with the one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted.  It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail  might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own. It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him.•  (Emphasis Supplied)",

Thus, it was urged that the petitioner could not act whimsically. Attention of this Court was drawn to Rule  3(2)(d) and Rule 3(4) of the I.T.

For instance, to establish criminal liability for negligence, the standard of proof is set much higher than for „civil liability‟ under the law of Torts for negligence. There is no reason why that higher standard should not be available to courts to determine whether an intermediary would be liable under the criminal law for action or inaction. It would also stand to reason that when the intermediaries have been granted the ―safe harbour‖ qua civil liability, and when a higher standard of culpability is required for a criminal prosecution, such “safe harbour” should be available even in respect of criminal prosecution. Thus, unless an active role is disclosed in the commission of the offences complained of, the intermediary, such as the present petitioner, would be entitled to claim protection under Section 79 of the I.T. Act. In other words, the question must be answered in the affirmative that when compliance with the “due diligence” requirement under Rule 3 of the I.T. Guidelines is evident, ex facie, the exclusion of liability under Section 79 of the I.T. Act would include exclusion from criminal prosecution.",

To say that „actual knowledge‟ requiring the removal of access, etc., under Rule 3(2)(d) of the I.T. Guidelines can be derived on the complaint submitted by a party, without a court order, would be problematic. The claim to a trade mark or copyright is often a stoutly contested affair even before a civil court. The intermediaries are certainly not situated to determine the correctness of a claim by a complainant to a trade mark or copyright. For instance, it could be a violater/infringer, who may complain to the intermediary against the registered owner of a trade mark or copyright to prevent use by such registered owner. If such a complaint, per se, was sufficient to take down the infringing material, etc., the havoc that can be caused to  e-commerce is beyond imagination.",

Further, the defendants have all the intention to sell the products in the market. Hence, a part of cause of action arose within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon•ble Court thereby this Hon•ble Court has jurisdiction to entertain and try and adjudicate the present suit under Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

This Hon•ble Court thus has the jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the suit.

                        "content": "In M/s RSPL Limited v. Mukesh Sharma & Anr.: 2016 SCC OnLine Del 4285, a Coordinate Bench of this Court, in a similar context, observed as under:  •27. Coming back to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff/appellant in paragraph 36 set out the nature of the cause of action, namely, the defendants/respondents were engaged in providing services under the impugned trade name •GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY•. In paragraph 37 of the plaint, it has been averred, first of all, that this Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit. But, this by itself, would not be sufficient because merely quoting the words of a section or the ingredients of a provision like the chanting of a mantra would not amount to stating material facts as noted by the Supreme Court in Hari Shanker Jain (supra). The material facts would, inter alia, have to include positive statement of facts. In the present case, paragraph 37 of the plaint contains the positive statement of fact that the defendants are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court by •conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name•. Further statements are made in the very same paragraph that the plaintiff has its corporate office in Delhi and carries out its business activity in Delhi under its trade mark/label through its dealers/distributors located in Delhi. A specific averment has also been made that the plaintiff's  goodwill and reputation is being tarnished by the alleged activities of the defendants, particularly in North-East Delhi as also in other parts of the country and that the plaintiff/appellant's proprietary rights are being prejudicially affected in the Delhi area due to the said activities. While considering an application under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC, these statements would have to be taken as correct. This would mean that this Court would have jurisdiction to try and adjudicate the present suit by virtue of Section 134(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 read with Section 20 CPC. The material fact that has been pleaded by the plaintiff is that the defendants/respondents are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name -GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY -within the jurisdiction of this Court. In case the defendants/respondents deny this averment (as they have done in their written statement but, which cannot be looked into at the stage of Order 7 Rule 10 CPC), the issue would arise as to whether the respondents/defendants are conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the trade name-GHARI TRADEMARK COMPANY-within the jurisdiction of this Court? Obviously, the onus of proof would lie on the appellant/plaintiff and at the stage of trial, evidence would have to be placed to substantiate this plea. But, at this stage, in our view, it is not necessary as Lord Denman, C.J. in Williams v. Wilcox (supra), to set out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving the material fact or the evidence to sustain the allegation contained in the material fact. We, therefore, do not agree with the view taken by the learned Single Judge that the plaint is bereft of any particulars with regard to territorial jurisdiction. We may observe that the learned Single Judge has also looked at the written statement and even at the replication in the course of arriving at his decision. This, in the context of an Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, cannot be done as already pointed out by us above. Taking the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised in the Order 7 Rule 10 CPC application, by way of a demurrer, as it must, the facts pleaded by the appellant/plaintiff must be taken to be true. Therefore, if we take the statement of the appellant/plaintiff in paragraph 37 to the effect that the defendants/respondents are committing the impugned acts within the jurisdiction of this Court  by conducting, soliciting, rendering the impugned services under the impugned trade name to be correct, then, it follows that this Court would have to proceed with the trial of the suit and cannot return the plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC.•  (underlined for emphasis)",

The modus operandi of the Defendant is to confuse the customers into buying the infringing products by using actual photographs and product description of EINSTEIN BOX products. As an illustration, Plaintiff uses a custom-made black tray for its ‘Ultimate Science Kit’, while the Defendant uses images of Plaintiff’s tray on Defendant No.1’s website under product information to misrepresent the contents of its impugned ‘Ultimate Science Kit’ which does not provide a black tray. This also leads to tarnishing the reputation of the Plaintiff and blurring its registered trademark. EINSTEIN BOX is based on the name of the world renowned and widely known Physicist Albert Einstein while Newton Box is based on the globally known  Scientist Sir Isaac Newton and therefore, there is a semantic similarity between the two trademarks. It cannot be disputed that both Einstein and Newton were not ordinary persons but were peerless geniuses. Applying the Mill’s Theory of Associative Memory, in the human mind, when both marks ‘Einstein’ and ‘Newton’ would be regularly presented in relation to a ‘world renowned genius/scientist’, a habit would form where thinking of Einstein shall bring to the mind the word Newton.",

Section 2(1)(h) of the Act defines ‘deceptive similarity’ and provides that a mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles the other mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion. A Division Bench of this Court in Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Allied Blender & Distillers Pvt. Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 10164, laid down the factors which are to be considered by the Courts to determine likelihood of confusion in cases of trademark infringement viz. similarity of trademarks, class of consumers, Defendant’s intention and proof of actual confusion. Similarity or identity of trademarks can be in the sound, sight or meaning. Courts in India have applied the test of similarity even in ideas, i.e. semantic similarity of two trademarks in deciding the question of their deceptive similarity.",

                        "content": "In Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Division Bench of this Court extensively examined the interplay between the settled position  with respect to deceptive similarity, English language, branding and related literature on human psychology and associated thinking, while considering deceptive similarity between trademarks ‘Officer’s Choice’ and ‘Collector’s Choice’ and held that the words ‘Collector’ and ‘Officer’ are both synonyms of a ‘Person holding an Office of Authority’ and hence, when both would be regularly presented in relation to a ‘Person holding an Office of Authority’, a habit would form where thinking of ‘Officer’ shall bring to mind the word ‘Collector’. It was observed by the Court that when a consumer while making an informed decision to purchase, is confronted with the product of the Appellant with the mark ‘Collector’s Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ shall bring to his mind the cue ‘person holding an office of authority’, which is related to the word ‘Officer’, since both are used in the context of whisky. This cue may guide the consumer in confusing the Appellant’s whisky with that of the Respondent or may generate a false memory that will lead to confusion. It was thus held that the two words are deceptively similar. On the same analogy, if ‘Einstein Box’ and ‘Newton Box’ would be regularly presented in relation of ‘learning kits for children’, a habit would form where thinking of the former would bring to the mind of the customers, the latter. Use of the impugned mark, which is deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s registered mark, by the Defendant amounts to infringement under Section 29(2) of the Act.",

In any case, conceptual similarity cannot be judged in isolation and the overall phonetic/visual/ structural similarity is also required to be seen holistically.

It is equally well settled that where a charge of copyright infringement is levelled against the Defendant, the test is to see whether the Defendant has copied the idea as also adopted the work substantially which on a prima facie look shows that it is an imitation. The principles elucidated to resolve the idea-expression dichotomy, as culled out by a Three-Judges Bench of the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra), are as follows:- “45. Thus, the position appears to be that an idea, principle, theme, or subject-matter or historical or legendary facts being common property cannot be the subject-matter of copyright of a particular person. It is always open to any person to choose an idea as a subject-matter and develop it in his own manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently from others. Where two writers write on the same subject similarities are bound to occur because the central idea of both are the same but the similarities or coincidences by themselves cannot lead to an irresistible inference of plagiarism or piracy. Take for instance the great poet and dramatist Shakespeare most of whose plays are based on Greek-Roman and British mythology or legendary stories like Merchant of Venice, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Ceasar etc. But the treatment of the subject by Shakespeare in each of his dramas is so fresh, so different, so full of poetic exuberance elegance and erudition and so novel in character as a result of which the end product becomes an original in itself. In fact, the power and passion of his expression, the uniqueness, eloquence and excellence of his style and pathos and bathos of the dramas become peculiar to Shakespeare and leaves precious little of the  original theme adopted by him. It will thus be preposterous to level a charge of plagiarism against the great playwright. In fact, throughout his original thinking, ability and incessant labour Shakespeare has converted an old idea into a new one, so that each of his dramas constitute a masterpiece of English literature. It has been rightly said that “every drama of Shakespeare is an extended metaphor”. Thus, the fundamental fact which has to be determined where a charge of violation of the copyright is made by the plaintiff against the defendant is to determine whether or not the defendant not only adopted the idea of the copyrighted work but has also adopted the manner, arrangement, situation to situation, scene to scene with minor changes or super additions or embellishment here and there. Indeed, if on a perusal of the copyrighted work the defendant's work appears to be a transparent rephrasing or a copy of a substantial and material part of the original, the charge of plagiarism must stand proved. Care however must be taken to see whether the defendant has merely disguised piracy or has actually reproduced the original in different form, different tone, different tenor so as to infuse a new life into the idea of the copyrighted work adapted by him. In the latter case there is no violation of the copyright.",

Saifullah, 2008 SCC Online Del 446, held as under:- “10. There is no doubt that the books involved in the present case are scientific and technical books. The themes in those books could be the same, but the presentation, treatment and the expression of the same theme would be different and cannot be identical. We have examined the original books and compared them with the books against which allegation of infringement is made in order to find out whether there was any intention to copy the original, and particularly the portions thereof which are shown to be reproduction by the appellant from their books. Some of the passages from the books published by both the parties, where similarity in the passages is apparent, find mention below:  ……  The afore-extracted comparisons are only specimens of the voluminous similar data placed on record by the appellant in the form of Annexures-G, D, E and F. The said comparisons would clearly establish that there are similarities in the expressions used. There are also a number of similarities in the introduction chapter wherein almost identical expression of the idea is used from the books of the appellant. The authors, who have written the books on behalf of the respondent No. 1, appears to have not only taken the facts and materials from the books of the appellant, but also the treatment and the expression appear to be the same at material places, both in the form and in the manner of expression of the idea. There are voluminous materials extracted from the various parts of the books and from different chapters thereof which are verbatim or near verbatim reproduction from the books of the appellant. Despite the fact that the aforesaid reproduced materials have been brought to our notice which are found to be similar and identical with those of the books of the appellant, which are used by the respondent in their books, the learned Single Judge held that as the books are on scientific and technical subject, therefore, there would be definitely discussion only on the common aspects and common engineering aspects and, therefore, it cannot be said that the defendants/respondents have infringed the copyright of the plaintiff/ appellant. The said deduction, in our considered opinion, cannot be held to be justified and we find the same to be erroneous.",

Most of the materials placed before us would indicate that in many theories and expressions used in the various chapters of the book, one or two sentences from the original books are dropped whereas the rest are used and reproduced in the same manner and with similar expression as that of the original books. Once the said materials are compared, it would be established that what is used by the respondents in their books is substantial and material reproduction of the work of the appellant. Being a scientific and technical book, theme could be said to be the same but unfortunately in the present case, the same is not presented differently from the books of the appellant and it appears to be verbatim reproduction in many passages, as is evident from the materials which are available on record. The same indicates the intention to copy the original. It, therefore, cannot be said that the work of the respondent is completely new or primary.

This Court does not agree with this contention of the Defendant for two-fold reasons. Firstly, Plaintiff has categorically stated that Defendant has itself applied for copyright registration for the impugned works and cannot approbate and reprobate, which position is not disputed by the Defendant and is rather admitted.  Secondly, legally speaking, copyright is not concerned with originality or novelty of ideas but with the expression of thought in a concrete form, as held in R.G. Anand (supra). It was held that though ideas, themes, historical or legendary facts being common property cannot be subject matter of copyright of a particular person, however, it is always open to any person to choose an idea as a subject matter and develop it in his own manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently.",

Anand (supra), in my prima facie view, the stand of the Plaintiff is correct that the components of the Einstein Boxes i.e. learning kits, which include books, activities, games and experiments, online marketing material, instruction manuals etc., do constitute original literary and artistic work as the Plaintiff, has by its skill and creativity, expended a different expression, character and quality to the work and is the author of the said work. The rhymes/alphabets/numbers/ science experiments may not be original, but the style of lettering, addition and placement of graphics, pictures, colours etc. are unique and distinct to the Plaintiff and it has by its different expression and aesthetic sense converted old ideas into new ones, entitling it to protection under the Copyright Act, 1957. In this context, I may allude to a judgment of this Court in Mohanlal Gupta v. Board of School Education, Haryana and Others, 1976 SCC Online Del 101, relevant paras of which are as under:- “2. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, defines ‘literary’ as ‘1. Pertaining to the letters of the alphabet, 2. Carried on by letter: epistolary, 3. Of or pertaining to, or of the nature of, literature, polite learning, or books and written compositions; pertaining to that kind of written composition which has value on account of its qualities of form, 4. Versed in literature; spec. engaged in literature as a profession. Of a society, etc.; Consisting of literary men.’ In Webster's Third New International Dictionary ‘literary’ is stated to mean-(i) literal, (ii) of, relating to, or having the characteristics of humane learning, (iii) of, relating to, or having the characteristics of literature, (iv) bookish, (v) of or relating to books, (vi) having a firsthand knowledge of literature, (vii) of, relating to, or concerning with men of letters or with writing as a profession.",

University Tutorial Press Limited, 1961 (2) Ch. 601, that the words ‘literary work’ cover work which is expressed in print  or writing, irrespective of the question whether the quality or style is high. According to their Lordships the word ‘literary’ seems to be used, in a sense somewhat similar to the use of word ‘literature’ in political or electioneering literature and refers to written or printed matter. In this case examination papers were treated as constituting literary work. The same view of the matter was taken in Jagdish Prasad Gupta v. Parmeshwar Prasad Singh, (AIR 1966 Pat. 33) and Agarwala Publishing House Khurja v. Board of High School and Intermediate Education U.P. Allahabad, (AIR 1967 Allahabad 91). Copinger and Skone James commented in their work on ‘Copyright’ (Eleventh Edition, page 71) ‘so long as there is a sufficient amount of skill and labour in constructing or selecting the material, no particular skill in the literary form is needed’ and it was noted that ‘copyright has been conferred in respect of newspaper telegrams, in the rules of a game, in the rules and coupon for a football competition and in tallies for bridge parties’. W. Broome, J., observed in the case of Agarwala Publishing House (supra) that the words ‘literary works’ in Section 13 are not confined to works of literature in the commonly understood sense but include all works expressed in writing whether they have any literary merit or not. In Mishra Bandhu Karyalaya v. Shivratanlal Koshal (AIR 1970 M.P. 261), a book of arithmetic was treated as literary work. The definition of ‘literary work’ provided by the Act embracing tables and compilations is comprehensive enough to cover without a shadow of doubt books like the one in dispute. There is no substance in the defendants' contention, therefore, that the plaintiff's book on household accounts and domestic arithmetic was not a literary work and the plaintiff could not claim to have a copyright therein.",

According to their Lordship of the Privy Council (Sec Macmillan and Company  Limited v. K. and J. Cooper, AIR 1924 P.C. 75) “any new and original plan, arrangement or compilation of material will entitle the author to copyright therein, whether the materials themselves be old or new” and “whosoever by his own skill, labour and judgment writes a new work may have a copyright therein unless it be directly copied or evasively imitated from another's work'.

No reader or viewer, while comparing these components in the competing products, would get an impression that there is any substantial copy or reproduction of the Plaintiff’s work by the Defendant, leave alone an imitation of a threshold to hold Defendant prima facie guilty of copyright infringement. No doubt that there is commonality in the use of numbers/ alphabets, on which in any case, no copyright can be claimed, but it is also manifest that the source being common, similarities are bound to occur. The manner, in which the Defendant has expressed the idea by use of its own skill or creativity, has resulted in a new work which cannot be said to be a literal imitation of the Plaintiff’s work. In fact, similarities are insignificant while dissimilarities outweigh the trivial similarities. As held by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra), in such a case, the Courts should determine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. In Dorsey v. Old Surety Life Ins. Co., 98 F. 2d 872, Phillips, J. observed that the right secured by a copyright is not the right to use of certain words, nor the right to employ ideas expressed thereby. Rather it is the right to that arrangement of words which the author has selected to express his ideas, and to constitute infringement in such cases a showing of appropriation in the exact form or substantially so, of the copyrighted material is required.",

Learned Senior counsel for the Defendant had contended that the injunction order is required to be vacated qua the product ‘Ultimate Science Kit’ since the two are completely different inasmuch as both have different product listings and packaging. Both products differ in the background colour, images on the packaging, number of experiments and more importantly, the words ‘Little Olive’ are clearly evident on the box and are enough to distinguish the kit of the Defendant from that of the Plaintiff. Having perused the two competing products, I am prima facie in agreement with the Defendant that there cannot be any confusion as the two are significantly different and Defendant cannot be said to have adopted the trade dress of the Plaintiff. A mere visual comparison brings forth the differences in colour scheme, layout and more importantly, one bears the name Einstein Box while the other has Little Olive prominently shown in the left corner and no customer can be confused. There is no gainsaying that if anyone sells a science kit with experiments in chemistry, perhaps the only way to depict would by showing images of test tubes, beakers, flasks, tripod stand etc. This alone cannot be a ground to contend that there was an intent to pass off the goods. In the present case, it is also apparent that the Defendant has used a different equipment, i.e. tripod stand, burner and a flask with a test tube stand in which the tubes are differently placed and there is no merit in the contention that the Defendant is passing off its product for that of the Plaintiff.

Clause (c) deals with identity of the registered mark as well as the goods/services covered by the said mark. Where the registered marks and the goods have an identity, Legislature provides that Courts shall presume confusion under Section 29(3) of the Act.

                        "content": "The law on the said subject has been laid down in several decisions but in order to avoid burdening the judgment, I may only refer to a judgment  of this Court in FDC Limited v. Faraway Foods Pvt. Ltd. 2021 SCC OnLine Del 1539, wherein relying on several judicial precedents as in Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd. (2004) 6 SCC 145, Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) SCC OnLine Supreme Court 578, Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma (supra), etc., the Court culled out the following principles:  “75.  …..  (xi)  On the concept of “deceptive similarity”, the following principles have emerged:  (a)  In assessing deceptive similarity, the class of the customer would purchase the product is relevant. The look/appearance, and the sound, of the trade marks, as well as the nature of the goods, are all relevant considerations. Surrounding circumstances are also relevant.  (b)  The onus of proof is on the plaintiff who alleges passing off. As against this, in an opposition to the registration of a trade mark, the onus to prove deceptive similarity is on the defendant who seeks non-registration, or removal of the trade mark from the register.  (c)  “Confusion” refers to the state of mind of the customer who, on seeing the mark, thinks that it differs from the mark on the goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful whether that impression is not due imperfect recollection. The question is one of first impression.  (d)  This is especially true in the matter of phonetic similarity. A meticulous comparison of the words, syllable by syllable, is to be avoided. The possibility of careless pronunciation and speech, both on the part of the buyer walking into the shop, as well as the shop assistant, is also required to be factored into consideration.  (e)  The matter has to be examined from the point of view of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. It has to be seen as to how such a purchaser would react to the trade mark, the association which he would form and how he would  connect the trade marks with the goods he would be purchasing.  (f)  The Pianotisi test, postulated over a century ago, has repeatedly been endorsed by the Supreme Court, as the definitive test to be adopted while comparing rival trade marks. According to this test, the Court is required to judge the rival trade marks by their look and sound, and consider  (i)  the goods to which they are to be applied,  (ii)  the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods,  (iii)  all surrounding circumstances and  (iv)  the consequences which would follow if each of the marks is used in the normal way as the trade mark for the goods of the respective owners.  While doing so, the common part of the words forming the competing marks may not be decisive. The overall similarity of the composite words is required to be seen, having regard to the circumstance (if applicable) that both are on like goods of similar description. The test to be applied is whether, if the two marks are used in a normal and fair manner, there is likelihood of confusion or deception.  (g)  The whole word/mark is to be considered. An ordinary man would not split a word or name, in a trade mark, into its components, but would go by the overall structural and phonetic similarity of the marks at the nature of the goods previously purchased, or of which he has been told and which he wants to purchase. It has to be examined whether the totality of the trade mark of the defendant is likely to cause deception/confusion or mistake in the minds of the persons accustomed to the existing trade mark of the plaintiff.  (h)  The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiff's mark. The Court is, however, required to apply both the phonetic and the visual tests. At times, ocular similarity may be sufficient to find possibility of confusion/deception, even if the marks are visually dissimilar, though ocular similarity, by itself, may not, generally, be the decisive test. Where, however, (i) in all other respects, the  marks of the plaintiff and defendant are different, (ii) the word/words, in the marks, which are phonetically similar, cannot be regarded as the dominant word, or essential feature, in the marks, and (iii) the surrounding circumstances also belie any possibility of confusion, it has been held that deceptive similarity cannot be found to exist merely on the basis of phonetic similarity or even identity. The matter, apparently, is always one of fact. The Court would have to decide, on a comparison of the two marks, and the parts thereof which are phonetically similar, as to whether such phonetic similarity is likely, considering all other circumstances, to confuse or deceive a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, always bearing in mind the nature of the goods, and the degree of circumspection which would be expected of the purchasers who would purchase such goods.  (i)  The Court is required to examine whether the essential features of the plaintiff's mark are to be found in the mark of the defendant. Identification of the essential features is a question of fact, left to the discretion of the Court.  (j)  No objective standards are possible, regarding the degree of similarity which is likely to cause deception. It has to be seen from the viewpoint of the purchasers of the goods.  (k)  The test to be applied would depend on the facts of the case. Precedents are valuable only to the extent they specify tests for application, and not on facts.  (l)  On the issue of deceptive similarity, and especially with respect to the aspect of phonetic similarity, English cases are not of relevance. English cases are useful only to the extent they aid in understanding the essential features of trade mark law. The tests for deceptive similarity, which apply in other jurisdictions, may not always apply in India.  ….”",

(supra). The Division Bench of this Court, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. (supra) and the “The Canadian Law of Trademarks and Unfair Competition by Harold G. Fox”, etc. held that marks containing words with the same sense relation or falling in the same semantic field or conveying the same or similar idea in the mind as that of previously existing marks are likely to be considered so similar as to be refused registration or deemed to constitute infringement of the previously existing trademark. As an illustration, the Division Bench took an example of five brands of ‘Orange Juice’ named after ‘Caribbean Islands’ and held as under:- “34. In the aforementioned two examples one observes that the similarity in idea conveyed by the word marks, through hyponymy or synonymy, can only be said to occur when the hyponymy or synonymy exists in a given context. Thus, when brands of orange juice are named after various islands of the Caribbean they convey a similar idea, which is likely to be only in the context of enjoying a glass of orange juice on a beach at one such tropical island. Similarly, when Men's perfumes are named after synonyms of the word Tough, the commonness of idea is created only when the words are synonymous in the context of masculinity, and not when any word which is synonymous to Tough, in a different context (such as dangerous, or risky) is used.”",

So, when a consumer has to make a decision regarding a purchase, and is confronted with the product of the appellant with the mark ‘Collector's Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ shall bring to his mind the cue ‘Person holding an office of authority’ which is related to the word ‘Officer’ since both trademarks in the present case are used in the same context for whisky.

In my prima facie opinion, none of these judgments inure to the advantage of the Plaintiff in the facts of the present case. The words ‘Collector’ and ‘Officer’ are no doubt hyponyms of the phrase “Person holding an office of authority” and as held by the Division Bench, when a consumer makes a decision regarding purchase of whisky and is confronted with the product marked ‘Collector’s Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ brings to his mind the cue of a person in authority and this cue may guide him to the product of the respondent who is selling whisky under the mark ‘Officer’s Choice’. In the present case, the argument on behalf of the Plaintiff, overlooks the fact that in this very judgment, the Court noted a word of caution that it is important to create a parameter within which marks conveying similar ideas should be accorded protection because if protection  is accorded to the sense relation of a word, it raises a slippery slope as to what extent such monopoly can be extended under the trademark law. It was held that a restrictive application needs to be made and protection should be granted to those sense relations of the words where the context, in which they are applied to the brand name, is the same and distinguished cases where an orange juice was named after any other island which is not in the Caribbean and posed a question whether trademark protection of synonyms would extend to all synonyms such that men’s perfumes cannot be named after any word synonymous to the word ‘Tough’.",

Elbert Einstein was a German born, Theoretical Physicist, best known for developing the theory of Relativity. Both the geniuses had their own respective contributions and it can hardly be even suggested that anyone would confuse one with the other. Moreover, the products in question in the  present case are learning kits etc. for children between 01 to 06 years of age and are both available only online. Insofar as the children are concerned, as averred by the Plaintiff itself, they would only be attracted or guided by the external layout, colour schemes, images, pictorial representations, etc. and not by the names Newton Box or Einstein Box. Considering the age of the children for whose consumption the products are being sold, in all probability, the parents or other older people would be making the informed decisions to purchase the products and to any such person with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, no cue would confuse the word Einstein with Newton.",

If the contention of the Plaintiff is to be accepted that once it has used the name ‘Einstein’ as part of its trademark, no other person or entity can use the name of any other scientist for similar or identical products, it would amount to holding that Plaintiff has acquired a right to seek injunction not only against use of ‘Newton’ but any other name of a mathematician, physicist, scientist etc. This would give an exclusivity or monopoly to the Plaintiff over names of all scientists in the public domain and public juris, which cannot be countenanced and, therefore, it cannot be held that the competing marks are deceptively similar or there is infringement of the Plaintiff’s registered trademark.

Chidambarasamy, 2017 SCC OnLine Mad 37798, wherein the Plaintiff, a proprietor of the rice mill had a registered trademark ‘VALLUVAR’ in class 30 for rice. It was contended  that the Defendant by using a similar brand name ‘THIRUVALLUVAR’ for the same product was infringing the Plaintiff’s trademark as the trademark was identical. Defendant had contended that ‘THIRUVALLUVAR’ is a common name and in the public domain and no restraint order can be passed against the Defendant. The Madras High Court after examining the matter held as under:- “16. In the present case, the name “VALLUVAR” is associated only with the Saint Poet of Tamil and is revered by the Tamil Diaspora in that capacity. Hence, the name of the Saint Poet is part of the Tamil culture and is common to all members of the Tamil Diaspora. Therefore, no one can claim monopoly or exclusivity over the name “VALLUVAR” or “THIRUVALLUVAR”. In the case of passing off, the appellant may escape liability if he can show that added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the respondent.

Under Rule 48 of the 2017 Rules, further evidence can be entertained if leave is sought by either of the parties. This is usually done, as per the practice of Registrar of Trademarks, by filing of an Interlocutory Petition (I.P.).

In some of these cases,  there is a simple misuse of the domain name and the intention of the registrant is to obtain monetary benefit. The same could be ‘cyber-squatting’ cases. Some others intend to gain monetarily from the trademark owner’s goodwill by selling their products using such domain names, bearing the Plaintiff’s mark. In other cases, the infringers have gone a step further and distributorships, franchises, dealerships, etc. have been offered fraudulently and large sums of money have been collected from unsuspecting customers. Initially, in each of these suits, the domain names are identified. However, the process of registration of infringing domain names has become successive and continuous. Such domain names have now multiplied owing to the large number of country code top-level domains (‘ccTLD’), generic top-level domains (‘gTLD’), international country code top-level domains (‘IDNccTLD’) and international generic country code top-level domains (‘IDNgTLD’), with various extensions that can be registered. The domain names can also be varied by making minor changes, such as changing the alphanumeric features or by addition of one or two characters, alphabets or numbers. These set of cases involve various popular brands and reliable trademarks, where consumers place their trust. Illustratively, the relevant marks involved in the cases are as below:",

The Court had directed as under:  “9. In the opinion of this Court, time has come for DNRs to create a mechanism by which any trademark owner who has an objection to the registration granted to any domain name, can approach the said DNR and seek cancellation/transfer of the said domain name. The same ought to be fairly considered through the mechanism which ought to be independent and impartial, for eg., through an Ombudsman. If the  cancellation/suspension/transfer as sought is not agreed to through the said mechanism, then the IP owner can avail of its remedies in accordance with law.",

Mr. Rao, purely for the purposes of assistance, has taken the Court through the agreements which ICANN enters into with the registry operators, as also the agreements entered into between the registry operators and the respective registrars. The Court has perused the said agreements and as per the said agreements, the following key obligations with respect to information of registrants have been highlighted:  (i)  Domain name registrations ought to be done through an “identifiable natural person”. Clause 1.6 of the Registry-Registrar Agreement (hereinafter “RRA”), reads as under:  “1.6. \"Personal Data\" refers to data about any identified or identifiable natural person.”  (ii)  Clause 2.6 of the RRA provides that the Registry Operator shall notify the Registrar of the “purpose for which Personal Data submitted to Registry Operator by Registrar is collected” and the mechanism to access and correct such data.  (iii)  Clause 3.1 of the RRA The said agreements also makes it abundantly clear that DNRs have to respond adequately to governmental or semi-governmental authorities operating in any country and also abide by the applicable laws and  regulations.  (iv)  Clause 3.5 read with 3.10 of the RRA provides that the DNR shall provide complete data as required by the Registry and shall abide by ICANN standards, policies and practices for which the Registry Operator has responsibility in accordance with the Registry Agreement (hereinafter “RA”).  (v)  At the Registry level, Clause 2.6 read with Specification 5 of the RA provides a schedule of reserved names which cannot be registered within TLDs, without express permission of ICANN. It provides that DNRs also have an obligation to curb illegal activity and not act in any manner which could result in damage to third parties including brand names and trademark owners.  (vi)  Clause 2.8 read with Specification 7 of the RA provides that legal rights of third parties shall be protected and the Registry Operator shall take reasonable steps to investigate and respond to any reports from law enforcement and governmental agencies for illegal conduct. Relevantly, the said clause provides as under:  “2.8 Protection of Legal Rights of Third Parties. Registry Operator must specify, and comply with, the processes and procedures for launch of the TLD and initial registration-related and ongoing protection of the legal rights of third parties as set forth Specification 7 attached hereto (“Specification 7”). Registry Operator may, at its election, implement additional protections of the legal rights of third parties. Any changes or modifications to the  process and procedures required by Specification 7 following the Effective Date must be approved in advance by ICANN in writing. Registry Operator must comply with all remedies imposed by ICANN pursuant to Section 2 of Specification 7, subject to Registry Operator’s right to challenge such remedies as set forth in the applicable procedure described therein. Registry Operator shall take reasonable steps to investigate and respond to any reports from law enforcement and governmental and quasi-governmental agencies of illegal conduct in connection with the use of the TLD. In responding to such reports, Registry Operator will not be required to take any action in contravention of applicable law.”",

                        "content": "After hearing the submissions made today by various parties, this Court is of the prima facie opinion that the manner in which the present system is working is completely unsatisfactory. Whenever any domain name is registered which consists of a well-known mark or a registered brand name which the owner intends to protect, the remedies that can be availed of  are either to seek remedies under UDRP or approach the Court. The sheer quantum and magnitude of domain names which are capable of being registered, especially by persons who intend to indulge in fraudulent activities would make it almost impossible for IP owners to avail of their remedies qua each and every domain name. Especially in the case of marks which are well known, there ought to be a more efficient framework which needs to exist. Considering the large sums of money that are being fraudulently obtained from various unsuspecting customers, all due to the lack of an active mechanism identification of such fraudulent parties, it is clear to the Court that the following aspects need to be addressed in these matters:  (i)  The manner in which the details of the domain name registrants, can be verified by the DNRs, at the time of registration of domain names;  (ii)  The manner in which the privacy protect feature and proxy servers are made available: whether it is only upon a specific registrant choosing the said option, rather than as a standard feature as part of a ‘bundle’;  (iii)  If the owner of a well-known brand or a trademark contacts any DNR, the manner in which the data related to the registrant can be provided, without the intervention of a Court, or any governmental agency;  (iv)  Whether the identity of the owner of a domain name, which consists of a registered trademark or a known brand can be verified at the time of registration itself;  (v)  If a specific link could be provided by the CGPTDM, covering a  list of well-known marks, maintained by the Registrar of the Trademarks, or declared by any Court of law, which can then be used for expedited blocking of domain names consisting of such marks;  (vi)  If there can be any agency that can be identified in India, such as NIXI, who can be made a repository of the data concerning the registrant, or an agency through which the data could be transmitted by the DNR, upon verification by NIXI, in case a trademark owner has a grievance against a specific domain name;  (vii)  If any directions are issued to the DNRs, and the same are not implemented, the manner in which the implementation of the said orders can be ensured;  (viii) Since almost all domain names are registered only after payments are made through credit card, or other online payment methods or apps, is it possible, upon request by any identified agency, to provide the information relating to the person who has made the payment, to the trademark owners. This should be discussed in the aforementioned meeting to be held on 30th August, 2022.",

Dinesh Kumar, the petitioner herein, was employed as a Caretaker with the Respondent No. 2. Respondent No. 1 is the University of Delhi whereas Respondent No. 2 is Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women (hereinafter referred to as “the College”).  b.  The College issued an advertisement in the Times of India on 26.3.1997 inviting applications for various  teaching and non-teaching posts. One of the posts notified at S. No. 7 was “Caretaker (1) (Rs. 950-1400), (SC)”, for which the qualifications prescribed were“matriculation with some experience of maintenance of Electrical, Sanitary, Water installations and Supervision of normal building repairs.” The petitioner by way of his application dated 2.4.1997, addressed to the Principal of the College, applied for the position of Caretaker.  c.  The College issued memorandum bearing number CASW/PF/DK/98/296(A) dated 21.7.1998 appointing the petitioner to the said position on daily wages for a period of three months.This was followed by another memorandum bearing number CASW/PF/DK/98/641(8) dated 5.10.1998 issued by the College whereby engagement of services of the petitioner was renewed on an ad-hoc basis for a period of six months. Thereafter, his appointment was continued from time to time by ad-hoc appointment letters until 2004.  d.  On 2.10.2002, the College again advertised a call for applications to certain non-teaching posts. One of the posts notified was for “Caretaker (l)”, against which the qualifications were notified as “Matriculation with some experience of maintenance, sanitary water installations and supervision of normal building repairs.” The  petitioner applied to the said position through his application dated 8.10.2002.  e.  On 26.4.2004, the petitioner sent a letter, by registered post to the Principal of the College, requesting for regularisation of his services as well as for giving him annual increments.  f.  On the same date, the College advertised a call for applications in the Time of India for recruitment to certain teaching and non-teaching positions. One of the positions notified in the non-teaching category at S. No. 3 was “Caretaker (1)”. The qualifications for the said position were the same as notified earlier. The petitioner applied to the said position through his application dated 28.4.2004, and his candidature was considered by the Selection Committee.  g.  In the meeting of the Governing Body of the College dated 5.8.2004, it was noted that for appointment to the post of Caretaker no one was recommended for regular appointment but in the case of petitioner, it was recommended to appoint him on purely ad-hoc basis, and he be asked to undergo training in electricity and sanitation within a period of one year. The recommendation was accordingly approved. The College issued an Office Order dated 10.8.2004, whereby the  petitioner was intimated about the said requirement to be fulfilled within the span of one year.  h.  The petitioner approached this Court by way of a Writ Petition bearing number WP (C) No. 153/2005 on 7.1.2005 praying for his regularisation. The said petition was disposed of by this Court vide the judgment dated 22.9.2006 wherein it was held that his services could not be regularised. The respondents therein were asked to take a decision, on the suitability of the petitioner to the post and whether to continue him in service, within a period of two months.  i.  Aggrieved by the said judgment, the petitioner by way of Letter Patents Appeal bearing no. LPA 2036/2006 approached a Division Bench of this Court, which was ultimately dismissed as withdrawn. During the pendency of the said appeal, the College on 17.10.2006 issued a letter to the petitioner, whereby the services of the petitioner as Caretaker were terminated.  j.  The petitioner, aggrieved by the same, has approached this Court by way of the instant petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India impugning the said termination order.",

The relief prayed for on behalf of the petitioner in the present case is the same as he would have, in the event of his success, obtained in the earlier writ petition before the High Court. The petitioner in reply contended that since the special leave petition before this Court was dismissed in limine without giving any reason, the order cannot be relied upon for a plea of res judicata. The answer is that it is not the order of this Court dismissing the special leave petition which is being relied upon; the plea of res judicata has been pressed on the basis of the High Court’s judgment which became final after the dismissal of the special leave petition. In similar situation a Constitution Bench of this Court in Daryao v. State of UP, AIR 1961 SC 1457, held that where the High Court dismisses a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution after hearing the matter on the merits, a subsequent petition in the Supreme Court under Article 32 on the same facts and for the same reliefs filed by the same parties will be barred by the general principle of res judicata. The binding character of judgments of courts of competent jurisdiction is in essence a part of the rule of law on which the administration of justice, so much emphasised by the Constitution, is founded and a judgment of the High Court under Article 226 passed after a hearing on the merits must bind the parties till set aside in appeal as provided by the Constitution and cannot be permitted to be circumvented by a petition under Article 32...”",

Res Judicata: No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such Court. […]  Explanation IV.--Any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of defence or attack in such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in such suit.  Explanation V.--Any relief claimed in the plaint, which is not expressly granted by the decree, shall for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been refused.  Explanation VI.--Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or of a private right claimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so litigating . […]  Explanation VIII.--An issue heard and finally decided by a Court of limited jurisdiction, competent to decide such issue, shall operate as res judicata in a subsequent suit, notwithstanding that such Court of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised.]”",

State of Himachal Pradesh2021 SCC OnLine SC 334, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated and summarized the principles governing the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court in the presence of an alternate remedy. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed:  “28. The principles of law which emerge are that:  (i)  The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well;  (ii)  The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person;  (iii)  Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice;  (c)  the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or  (d)  the vires of a legislation is challenged;  (iv)  An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in an appropriate case though ordinarily, a writ petition should not be entertained when an efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law;  (v)  When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion; and  (vi)  In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be interfered with.”",

Reference may also be made to New Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus of the English Language, 1992 which defines •Allied• as •relating in subject or kind• and •Cognate• as •1. adj. having a common ancestor or origin (of languages or words) having a common source or root (of subjects etc.) related, naturally grouped together.•. Cognate goods/services can be described, inter alia, as goods or services which have a trade connection -as in glucose and biscuits (See Corn Products Refining Co. v.

                        "content": "Mr. Amit Sibal, Senior Counsel for the Plaintiffs, advanced the following submissions:  A.  Novelty of Plaintiffs’ Registered Design: Unlike traditional hip flasks which are broad and short, the Hipster is modelled on the shape and proportions of a smartphone. Its essential features reside in its: (a) tall, lean and sleek look, (b) rectangular shape inspired from the shape and proportion of a smartphone; (c) smooth rounded shoulders and symmetrical edges; (d) protruding V-shaped neck situated at the middle of both shoulders; (e) symmetrically raised and plateau-like front and rear walls; (f)two-toned rimmed and rounded cap; and (g) dimpled bottom. The said essential features form the ‘shape and configuration’ of its distinctive design, compositely creating a visual impression that is ‘appealing to the eye’. No third-party has ever adopted a 180 ml bottle/packaging of a similar ‘shape and configuration’ with such novel design and strikingly distinctive visual impression that ‘appeals to the eye’, as that of Plaintiffs’ Registered Design. Further, the definition of ‘hipster’ has no relation to a hip flask or the anatomical part ‘hip’, but is completely arbitrary when used with respect to bottles, and means “one that follows trends that are out of the ordinary”.  B.  Marketing expenses: Considerable amount has been spent to promote the Hipster through advertising and social media marketing.  C.  Profits and goodwill: The Hipster has proved to be a runaway success, with almost 95000 cases (of 48 bottles each) worth Rs. 100 crores sold in just 1.5 years in India. As evident from its sales turnovers, media and social media coverage and awards received, the Plaintiffs have extensive goodwill and reputation in their product.2 The Defendant’s imitation itself is a testament to the Plaintiffs’ reputation and goodwill.3  D.  Common law rights in trade dress: A shape can also be protected as a trade mark, if it is used as a source identifier. Plaintiffs have common law rights in the trade dress and get-up in their Bottles comprising of unique and distinctive non-functional visual features, such as the monochromatic colour scheme, two-toned rimmed and rounded cap bearing a different colour, manner of depiction of text and label, indentations and embellishments. Such a cumulative combination of visual features results in a distinctive trade dress, which creates a strong visual impression in the mind of the consumer, and thus, Plaintiffs’ unique trade dress acts as a source identifier.  clarification of the ex-parte ad-interim injunction granted vide order dated 23rd February, 2021, seeking that the Defendant be allowed to use a proposed design disclosed in the said application, which was being adopted in addition to the bottle/flask design impugned in the present suit. The same was dismissed as not maintainable vide order dated 11th October 2021.",

                        "content": "Mr. Chandar M. Lall, Senior Counsel for the Defendant, on the other hand, has laid a challenge to the Plaintiffs’ Registered Design itself and denies any infringement or passing-off. His submissions are as follows:  A.  The present suit has been filed with mala fide intentions and is an attempt to drive out legitimate competition.  B.  Defendant is a reputed liquor manufacturer and has sold more than 35 lakh cases of ‘GOA’ branded products in the last 3 years, with over INR 100 crores in sales for FY 2019-2020. The ‘GOA’ mark of Defendant has no resemblance to the Plaintiffs’ brands viz. ‘VAT 69’, ‘BLACK DOG’ and ‘BLACK & WHITE’.  C.  Defendant prominently displays its mark ‘GOA’ on all its products and the same is widely recognised by customers. The presence of such apparently different brands completely eliminates any chances of confusion between them.  D.  The Plaintiffs are not the creators or proprietors of the design: Plaintiffs admitted in Interrogatory No. 1 that the ‘creator’ of the Hipster design is an agency named Love Creative. There is no pleading relating to Love Creative, as only website pages of Love Creative have been shown in the plaint, which cannot fulfil the requirement of Section 2(j) of the Designs Act. Since there is no pleading that the said author has executed the work for Plaintiffs for good consideration, or has assigned the same to the Plaintiffs, and no documentation has been shown to this effect either, the mandate of Section 2(j) of the Designs Act has not been met. Thus, prima facie the registration is liable to be cancelled.  E.  Invalid Designs under the Designs Act: Unlike trademarks and copyrights, patents and designs laws are strictly based upon validity of registration. If registrations are prima facie invalid, then any monopoly therein ends, and the design falls to the public domain, which includes  the right to freely copy.4 Under designs law, Registration is not prima facie evidence of validity. In cases where there is a serious challenge to a design, or where a design is new and has not been tested, injunctions should not be granted.5 The test, under designs law, is not from a consumer’s point of view, but of an instructed person having knowledge of the state-of-the-art and common-to-trade aspects of the design.  F.  Plaintiffs’ Registered Design No. 306577 is liable to be cancelled under Sections 19(1)(b), 19(1)(c), 19(1)(d) read with 2(d), 2(g), 2(j), 4(c), and 22(3) of the Designs Act, on the following grounds:  (i)  The design stands disclosed through prior art: The shape and configuration of Plaintiffs’ Bottles, is “inspired” from hip flasks, and is extremely common to the liquor trade, being already in use by other brands, as is evident from the visual representation below:  In fact, both the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s bottles are mere trade-variants of the hip flask, and hence not registrable. Moreover, an admission to this effect is filed by Plaintiffs in the form of a newspaper interview filed as annexure-10, where they admit to such inspiration.  (ii)  The Hipster’s design is not new and original. The registration is liable to be cancelled as the design is not new, novel or original. The introduction of ordinary trade variants into an old design cannot make it new or original.6 Some of the pre-existing designs are:  The term “new and useful” is a recognised term used in relation to a primarily utilitarian function, and hence, would be the subject matter of a patent; whereas, under designs law, ‘novelty’ means “new and original”. The moment the creator says a design is not ‘novel’, in effect, what is being stated is that it is not new and original. Further, the Plaintiffs had claimed that the design was “new and useful” in their response to the interrogatories; and now cannot be permitted to refute their stance by way of a note on arguments. Under Section 4(c) of the Designs Act, a design should be “significantly distinguishable from known designs or combination of known designs”. Small infinitesimal changes are not sufficient to constitute a ‘new’ or ‘novel’ or ‘original’ design.  (iii)  The Hipster’s design is functional: The use of the terms ‘pocket scotch’ or ‘Hipster’ in the plaint, in relation to Plaintiffs’ Registered Design, is indication that the design in issue is utilitarian in nature. Its shape and configuration is designed to fit a  hip-pocket, taking inspiration from a hip flask. The argument that the design was inspired by the smartphone is fallacious, since the designs of a smartphone and hip flask are similar to each other to the extent that both fulfil one basic utilitarian aspect of fitting in a pocket.  (iv)  The Plaintiff has contended that the design is “inspired from the smartphone” and is “unlike the shape of traditional flasks”; whereas, on its website, it is mentioned that the Hipster is a “hip-flask-size pack”. A party cannot be permitted to take a stand before the Court contrary to what has otherwise been represented to the public for commercial benefits.7 In fact, this is not the first instance that the Plaintiffs have been accused of fraudulently claiming rights in ordinary bottle shapes.8  (v)  Mosaicing is impermissible under Section 4(c) of the Designs Act.9 A different combination of familiar contrivances cannot be injuncted.10  G.  There is no similarity in the overall trade dress of the two products, which could cause confusion or deception. There are several differences between the shape, get-up and pricing of the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s Bottles, and hence, no injunction is warranted. They are a few millimetres different in size. Afterall, bottles of the same quantity  are bound to have only slight variations from each other, and will have the same height if they have the same bottom circumference.11  H.  No injunction is liable to be granted as the Defendant has raised a credible challenge to Plaintiffs’ Registered Design. Moreover, it is a well-settled principle that injunction does not follow as a matter of routine in cases when serious disputed questions arise, such as prior publication of the design, lack of originality, trade variation, etc.12  I.  There can be no restrain qua passing off in a registered design. 13 Plaintiffs’ Bottles are constituted of common-to-trade elements, and therefore, no distinctiveness can be claimed in the overall get-up. No case for passing off can be made by merely showing imitation of parts of the get-up of goods which are common-to-the-trade.14 Hence, the shape of a bottle which is a registered design is to be disregarded for the purpose of passing off.  J.  Without prejudice to the contention that Defendant has not copied Plaintiffs’ products; nonetheless, even a conscious attempt to copy, in itself, does not constitute either infringement or passing off.  2 Reliance was placed on: Cello Household Products v.

                        "content": "On the issue of effect of registration, as prima facie evidence of validity, a juxtaposition is drawn between the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act specifically notes that “Registration shall be prima facie evidence of validity”. Curiously, there is no such corresponding section in the Designs Act, which is a later statute. This, by necessary corollary, means that the drafters intended that no such implication is to be drawn for registration of designs. The reason for this difference in treatment of a registered design vis-a-vis a registered trade mark, lies in the registration process. While both applications invite objections before the Examiner/ Controller, only trade mark applications are advertised for ‘opposition’ in terms of Section 21 of the Trade Marks Act. Oppositions, if any, are then adjudicated by the Registrar of Trade Marks on the basis of statement(s) and counter-statement(s), after duly hearing the applicant and opponent. These steps are undertaken prior to the grant of registration. In contrast, public opposition stage is wholly missing in the design registration process. Under Section 5(1) of the Designs Act, for registering a design, the Controller is essentially to consider whether (or not) the design applied for has previously been published in another country, and whether it is contrary to public order or morality. Thereafter, such design is made open to public inspection by way of publication only post-registration, in terms of Section 7 of the Designs Act. Hence, the only remedy available to an aggrieved person qua registration of a design, is to apply for cancellation after the grant. This is the reason Section 22(3) allows a  defendant in a suit for infringement of design, to take all defences available under Section 19 in respect of cancellation of design. Unsurprisingly, there is no corresponding section in the Trade Marks Act to Section 22(3) of the Designs Act.  (ii) where any person acquires the design or the right to apply the design to any article, either exclusively of any other person or otherwise, means, in the respect and to the extent in and to which the design or right has been so acquired, the person by whom the design or right is so acquired; and  (iii) in any other case, means the author of the design; and where the property in or the right to apply, the design has devolved from the original proprietor upon any other person, includes that other person.  19 Upon a query of the Court on this aspect during a listing of the matter on 15th July 2022, Mr. Kapil Wadhwa, counsel for the Defendant stated that an application for cancellation has been filed, but the authority is yet to serve the Plaintiff, as per rules, which is corroborated by the counsel for the Plaintiffs.  20 Reliance placed on: Niki Tasha India Pvt Ltd. v.

Thus, to see whether the imitation is obvious, the same should strike at once on a visual comparison of the article containing the registered design and the article containing the design which is said to be infringing the registered design. The impugned design should be very close to the original design -the resemblance of the original design being immediately apparent to the eye while looking at the two designs. Fraudulent imitation is one which is deliberately based upon the registered design. The imitation may be less apparent than an obvious imitation. There may be subtle distinction between the registered design and the alleged fraudulent imitation, and yet the fraudulent imitation although different in some respects from the original, renders it as a perceptible imitation when the two designs are closely scanned.”  xx  … xx … xx “163. In Polar Industries Ltd. (supra) since the design registration claim by the plaintiff pertained to the entire article as a whole, namely, a table fan/portable fan, the Court held that overall view of the registered designs of the plaintiff -comprising of configuration, shape and ornamentation will have to be considered for the purpose of comparison.

While applying this test, the Court is also conscious that not every resemblance between the two designs would amount to infringement. The comparison by the eye has been done by physically holding in hand the Defendant’s impugned bottle alongside the Plaintiffs’. Unequivocally, at first blush, the Defendant’s impugned bottles bear a remarkable similarity to the Hipster. All the unique, essential and novel features of the Hipster: long, lean and sleek design, curved shoulders, ‘v’ element on the neck, etc. are found on the impugned bottle as well. In terms of shape, the bottles have identical necks, shoulders, joints and edges. Both are identically rectangular in shape, and have a dimpled bottom, which, indeed is nearly-identical and has sufficient similarity to make it difficult for the consumer to distinguish one from the other. In fact, even upon undertaking a microscopically detailed examination, or applying the instructed eye test, only three points of difference emerge: firstly, the Defendant’s bottle has a crest-shaped logo of the Defendant’s company embossed on the upper portion at the front, whereas the Hipster is plain. Secondly, the Defendant’s bottle is a few millimetres shorter and very slightly more bulbous than the Hipster. Thirdly, and lastly, the neck of the impugned product is about one millimetre shorter. However, when examined from a distance of three to five yards, which is a reasonable distance between a potential consumer and the shelf of a liquor store where the bottles may be  displayed together, the differences vaporise.25 Besides, the impugned design need not be an exact replica to constitute infringement. Minor changes in size are insignificant as the overall and substantial similarity is glaring and undeniably apparent to the naked eye. The Court is, thus, satisfied that Defendant’s product is deceptively similar to the Plaintiffs’ Registered Design.  22 Reliance was placed on: Alert India v.

Elaborating further, what is new is quite obvious in that it comes into existence for the first time, however, a design may not be new in the sense it may already be available in the public domain, however, in its application for a particular purpose it may be totally original in the application which was not otherwise conceived of and therefore can amount to a new creation for commercial application thus entitling the same to copyright protection.” [Emphasis Supplied]",

Gambhir & Ors., 30 as follows:  “It is rightly held in the cases decided that in the matter of novelty the eye is to be the ultimate test and the determination has to be on the normal ocular impression. In order to know its newness or originality it is necessary that a design identical with or even materially similar to the relevant design should not have been published or registered previously. A slight trivial or infinitesimal variation, from a pre-existing design will not qualify it for registration. Taking into account the nature of the article involved, the change introduced should be substantial. It is not necessary to justify registration that the whole of the design should be new, the newness may be confined to only a part of it but that part must be a significant one and it should be potent enough to impart to the whole design a distinct identity, unless registration is sought for the said part alone.”  [Emphasis Supplied]",

It is a matter of first impression. In The Wimco Ltd. v.

Therefore, the concept of design is that a particular figure conceived by its designer in his mind and it is reproduced in some identifiable manner and it is sought to be applied to an article. Therefore, whenever registration is required then those configuration has to be chosen for registration to be reproduced in any article. The idea is that the design has to be registered which is sought to be reproduced on any article. Therefore, both the things are required to go together, i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article.  “44. Our attention was invited to Gammeter v. Controller of Patents & Designs and others A.I.R. 1919 Cal. 887. Their Lordships discussed the concept of new and original. In that context, it was observed as follows:  “A design in order to be new or original within the meaning of the Act, need not be new or original in the sense of never having been seen before as applied to any article whatever, there might be a novelty in applying an old thing to a new use, provided it is not merely analogous. Where the design of a metal band called the “Novelty band,” intended to attach a  watch to the wrist, was similar in shape and configuration to a bracelet previously manufactured for ornamental purpose.”  Their Lordships further held as follows:  “Though the shape of the “Novelty” band by itself could not be said to be new and original, the application of it to a watch to be worn on the wrist was for a purpose so different from and for a use so similar to the purpose and use of the bracelet that the design in question might be said to be original.”  Therefore, this case also depended on the appreciation of the material placed before the Court.”",

                        "content": "Needless to say, a bottle/hip flask is not a new or novel invention by itself; they have been used for the purpose of carrying liquid since time immemorial and their design certainly lies in the public domain. The innovation and novelty of the design, as conceptualised in the mind of its author, lies not in the bottle/flask design, but in the “shape and configuration” as applied to a bottle. Plaintiffs’ claim is that no one has applied a shape inspired by smartphones to liquor bottles prior to the Plaintiffs. Mr. Sibal had elaborated on this creative idea of converting the 180 ml bottle into the portable Hipster flask, in a deliberately smaller format, to say that the aim was to attract young aspirational drinkers who may have lower disposable incomes and are not be able to afford the expense of larger 750 ml bottles. Indeed, the design has the ubiquity; it is travel-sized slim, glossy, angular, and has fit-in-the-pocket characteristics of the smartphone. To that effect, it is also not the Defendant’s case that there exists a prior-publication which is based upon the lean and thin design of a smartphone. The Plaintiffs’ product is the first in the market to take the visually-appealing features of a smartphone and apply it to pre-packaged alcohol. None of the third-party products shown by the Defendant are pre-filled flasks which have the striking ocular attraction of the Hipster bottles. The Defendant has shown no other  manufacturer/ distributor of alcohol that prefills and sells their product in a bottle that look and feel like that of the Plaintiffs’. It also weighs on the mind of the Court, as further evidence of originality, that Plaintiffs’ Registered Design had been conceptualised and designed after undertaking extensive research and development. The mental activity that has gone into conceiving the design is exhibited in this novel concept in the bottling industry which has been in existence for quite some time. The aesthetic appeal (or in other words, the pleasing, attractive appearance) which is the sum total of the configuration of the unique features discussed above (rounded shoulders, V neck, symmetrical design, raised front and back etc.) is the novelty that needs protection. It is not just a trade variant of previous design, as sought to be trivialised by the Defendant. A bottle is undoubtedly a common article which has common features, such as neck, shoulders, etc. It is an article that offers limited artistic freedom to innovate. Yet, it has been significantly transformed in the Hipster, with distinguishable features, giving it an aesthetic appeal that had not been conceived hereinbefore. This clearly meets the threshold of ‘new and original’ as it creates an altogether different impression on an informed user, entitling the Plaintiff to exclusivity. Undoubtedly, a transformed bottle will still remain a bottle, but that is not the test to be applied. Accepting this argument would only mean that for common articles, there can be no ‘new or original’ product. That would hinder innovation, creativity and inspiration which can never be the intent or theme of laws relating to intellectual properties.",

If that were so, we should never see any new or original design at all. It is a general rule that “mosaicing” of prior art, i.e., combining selected features in different prior art publications, is not permissible when assessing whether an invention is new. Conversely, mosaicing is also no defence to a charge of infringement of a registered design. Mosaicing contemplates taking known integers or combinations and simply re-arranging them. In a situation like ours, it might for example apply if Cello laid claim to a very similar bottle with a similar shape, configuration and ornamentation but merely repositioned the ornamentation by setting it horizontally rather than vertically and doing not much else besides. That is not the case here. [Emphasis Supplied]",

Dabur India Ltd., 40 as follows:  “17. Passing off is a tortious action for deceit.

First, the plaintiff must be able to establish that it has the necessary goodwill and reputation in the goods sold or services offered to the consumers at large which in turn should be interlinked with the get-up in which they are proffered.  ii.  Second, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that the defendant’s misrepresentation qua the goods or services offered by him have led consumers to believe that they originate from the plaintiff.  iii.  Third, that the action of the defendant has resulted in damage or is likely to result in damage on account of the misrepresentation of the defendant with regard to the origin of the goods and services.  39 Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd. v.

In this behalf, see the following observations in Rich Products Corporation & Anr. vs. Indo Nippon Food Ltd., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 734 [which were sustained by the Division Bench of this Court, vide judgement dated 20.09.2010, passed in RFA (OS) No. 37/2010].  “39. Consequently, this brings me to the submission of the plaintiffs that the defendant’s use of the infringed mark constitutes passing off. In this connection, let me reiterate the well known parameters of what constitutes passing off. Passing off as is ubiquitously held in most jurisdictions subject to usual turn of phrase or change of phraseology, a tort of false representation, whether intentional or unintentional whereby, one person attempts to sell his goods or services as those manufactured or rendered by another which is “calculated” to damage the goodwill of that other person. Thus, the necessary ingredients which a plaintiff in an action of passing off is required to prove, is the:  (i)  employment of deception. Mere confusion will not suffice;  (ii)  intent is not a necessary as long as the unwary consumer is deceived; and  (iii)  the act of the tort should injure the goodwill not just his reputation.(...)”“ [Emphasis Supplied]",

                        "content": "In light of the foregoing discussion, the Court now proceeds to make a comparison of the trade-dress of the products in question. Immediately, it is noticed that the Hipster is marketed in three colour variants: white, golden and black. The Defendant’s bottles are in the colour variants red and black. Whilst all the bottles are in a dual-chromatic scheme, there is indeed some grain of truth in the Defendant’s submission that the black-and-gold combination is common to trade, and has been used by a plethora of alcohol manufacturers. Mr. Lall had produced various such trade dresses, which are extracted below:  Similarly, a two-toned rimmed and rounded cap, too, has been widely used in the said industry and is not unique to the Plaintiffs. Hence, upon a comparison of the trade dress as a whole, the Court cannot prima facie agree that the essential features are distinctive enough to become a source identifier. Apart from the black & gold colour scheme, there is hardly any similarity in the labels, trade dress, and get-up. Thus, the Court is not entirely convinced that the same is being imitated by the Defendant to deceive unwary customers. The Court is further prima facie unconvinced that the purported imitation of the Hipster’s trade dress by the Defendant has resulted in some tangible confusion with regard to the origin or source of the goods, considering that the ‘GOA’ brand is boldly displayed on the bottle, the labels are largely dissimilar, and the price points of the goods are vastly different.",

                        "content": "Before moving on, clarification on one aspect is necessary, lest it might lead to confusion. While examining the issue of passing off, the Court has not borne in mind the design similarities, for which the Defendant is found  to be at fault as discussed above. This claim of the Plaintiff is analysed squarely on the aspect of passing off of the trade dress, overall get-up, and presentation of the product through packaging. Even on the above noted aspect, there are undeniably some similarities which are quite visible, but they are largely occurring because of identical designs (for which the plaintiff is entitled to injunction on account of design infringement) and the mono-chromactic colour of the bottles. However, at this interim stage, such similarities are not sufficient to grant injunction on a passing off action, particularly when the trinity test, recounted above is not met.",
