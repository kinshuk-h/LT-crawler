According to the Respondent, allowing the registration of the Appellant’s mark would adversely affect public interest as it would lead to confusion amongst a buyer of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. Relevant part of the impugned orders is extracted hereunder:- “Instant mark is phonetically and visually similar to the conflicting marks which is mentioned in the search report and also they are well in prior use in respect of the identical goods which sought by the applicant. The applicant is the well subsequent user among the conflicting marks user period. In view of these grounds, the Tribunal has opined that the applicant has deliberately chosen the subject mark in an effort to ride upon the goodwill and reputation of the conflicting marks. Applicant has no bona fide adoption of the subject mark in respect of the applied goods. Further, the allowance of the subject mark is patently mala fide since the mark has been dishonestly adopted by the applicant hence the applicant cannot claim to be the proprietor of the subject mark under Section 18(1) of the Act. Allowance of the subject mark is adversely affecting the interest of the public, it would lead to confusion as it is more than likely, due to imperfect recollection that the average buyer may confuse the applicant’s mark as the conflicting owners products. In view of such similarities between the nature of the marks and their goods, the applicant's trade channel and counters, there exists a strong likelihood of confusions on the part of the consuming public, including an association, as they are likely to assume and confuse that the applicant’s goods are connected or otherwise associated with the conflicting marks goods, when no such connection exists. Consequently, the members of the trade would no doubt, be under the mistaken belief that the applicant’s goods originate from the conflicting marks or that they have some trade connection or affiliation thereby causing irreparable loss and damage not only to the conflicting marks trade and business but  also suiting erosion of distinctiveness hard earned by the conflicting marks.”",

Section 12 of the Act provides that in case of honest concurrent use or of other special circumstances, which in the opinion of the Registrar, make it proper so to do, he may permit registration by more than one proprietor of the trademarks which are identical or similar, whether any such trademark is already registered or not, in respect of same or similar goods and subject to such conditions that it may impose. The Act, therefore, envisages a situation where despite a trademark sought to be registered being identical or similar to a cited mark can be registered in case of honest concurrent use or any other ‘special circumstances’.

The trademark ‘SOMANY’ is inherently distinctive and due to continuous and extensive use has become synonymous with the products and services of the Plaintiff to such an extent that the reputation and goodwill of the trademark is no longer restricted to the Classes in which the Plaintiff has obtained registrations and/or travels across classes.",

The very fact that Defendants adopted an identical trademark being in the same industry, knowing its goodwill shows their dishonest adoption and intent to encash upon the reputation and goodwill of Plaintiff. For the first time in their reply before this Court, Defendants have come up with a plea that the trademark ‘SOMANY’ was adopted, based on the name of Defendant No. 5’s wife, namely, Ms. Sumani Mittal, which is nothing but an afterthought and a dishonest plea. This is evident from the fact that the trademark SOMANY is registered in Class 11 in the name of Defendant No. 2 and not Defendant No. 5. Furthermore, in their own suit filed before the Rohini District Court, Defendants have averred that Plaintiff/Shri Suresh Kumar conceived, coined and honestly adopted the trademark/word name SOMANY in the year 1998 and has been using the same without any interruption since 1998. Throughout in the Trade Marks Registry, during prosecution of their trademark as also in the oppositions filed against Plaintiff’s trademark, consistent stand of the Defendants has been that Mr. Suresh Kumar coined the term SOMANY. Thus, the stand taken before this Court is not only false but also inconsistent with the earlier stand.",

In fact, Plaintiff’s other products sold under  the trademark ‘SOMANY’, such as sanitaryware, plumbing items and bathroom fittings, in respect of which also Plaintiff has registrations and extensive use, are also similar to the impugned goods. In this view, a consumer with average intelligence and imperfect recollection, who purchases similar goods with identical trademark is likely to be confused and deceived into believing that the products originate from or are associated with the Plaintiff. The transcripts/translations of the consumer complaints filed in this Court would show actual consumer confusion qua geysers/water heaters sold by the Defendants, where the consumer was actually deceived into believing that the products emanated from the Plaintiff and were of a substandard quality.",

Reliance was placed on the judgment in Laxmikant v. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah & Another, (2002) 3 SCC 65, for the said proposition.

The word SOMANY is not a dictionary word or an everyday term. The term was adopted in 1968 by the Plaintiff and is arbitrary with no meaning in relation to the products sold by the Plaintiff. On the proposition that an arbitrary trademark is entitled to a high degree of protection, reliance was placed on the judgment in Telecare Network Pvt. Ltd. v. Asus Technology Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8739. The word SOMANY could not have come to the knowledge of the Defendants through imagination and the only source was a long reputation and goodwill earned by the Plaintiff since 1968 in the tiles business and subsequently in other allied products. It is a settled  position of law that no amount of user can justify dishonest adoption of a mark and is deemed to be fatal to the defence of the Defendants. Reliance was placed on the judgment in Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. (supra). Reliance was also placed on the judgment in Amar Singh Chawla v. Rajdhani Roller Flour Mills, 1989 SCC OnLine Del 434, for the proposition that if there is a dishonest adoption of the mark, no amount of evidence of use can be raised as a defence by the Defendants. In any case Defendants have not placed any evidence of actual user of the trademark since 1998 as the sales invoice on record dates back to 2007 and no other document reflects sales for a period prior thereto. Moreover, the invoices indicate that Defendants do not give any warranty for their goods and leave it for the respective companies to furnish the warranties, which is a strange situation inasmuch as it is difficult to comprehend as to why an owner and proprietor of a brand will refuse to provide warranty for its goods.",

                        "content": "In the light of the fact that both the Plaintiff and Defendants have valid registrations in their favour with respect to the trademark ‘SOMANY’, the primordial question that begs an answer is as to what are the rights of one registered proprietor of a trademark against another registered proprietor  of an identical trademark. Section 28 of the Act clearly provides that a registered proprietor of a trademark has an exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to the goods or services in respect of which it is registered as well as to enforce the same in respect of its infringement in the manner provided by the Act. One of the controversies that arises in the present case, i.e., competing rights of two registered owners, is directly covered by Section 28 (3) of the Act. Plain reading of the provision shows that exclusive right to use the trademark shall not be deemed to have been acquired by one registrant against the other and this clearly connotes that holder of the registered trademark will have a concurrent right to use the same as against another registrant of the same mark. Therefore, Plaintiff who is a registered owner of the trademark ‘SOMANY’ cannot sue the Defendants for infringement of its registered trademark. Interpreting Section 28 of the Act, the Supreme Court in S. Syed Mohideen v. P. Sulochana Bai, (2016) 2 SCC 683, has clearly held so and relevant passages are as follows:- “27. Sub-section (3) of Section 28 with which we are directly concerned, contemplates a situation where two or more persons are registered proprietors of the trade marks which are identical with or nearly resemble each other. It, thus, postulates a situation where same or similar trade mark can be registered in favour of more than one person. On a plain stand-alone reading of this Section, it is clear that the exclusive right to use of any of those trade marks shall not be deemed to have been acquired by one registrant as against other registered owner of the trade mark (though at the same time they have the same rights as against third person). Thus, between the two persons who are the registered owners of the trade marks, there is no exclusive right to use the said trade mark against each other, which means this provision gives concurrent right to both the  persons to use the registered trade mark in their favour. Otherwise also, it is a matter of common sense that the plaintiff cannot say that its registered trade mark is infringed when the defendant is also enjoying registration in the trade mark and such registration gives the defendant as well right to use the same, as provided in Section 28(1) of the Act.",

This issue also arose before the Supreme Court in S. Syed Mohideen (supra) and deciding the interplay between Sections 27(2) and 28(3) of the Act, the Supreme Court held that collective reading of provisions of Sections 27, 28, 29 and 34 of the Act would show that rights conferred by registration are subject to the rights of the prior user of the trademark and that the rights and remedies of any person with respect to passing off its goods by another person are not affected by the provisions of Section 28(3), as they have genesis in the common law. It was further held that rights in passing off emanate from common law and not from the provisions of the Act and thus remain unaffected and are independent of other rights conferred by the Act, including those under Section 28(3), which is self-evident from reading of the opening words of Section 27(2) viz; ‘Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect rights….’.",

Passing off action is therefore, as held, an action in deceit because the common law rule is that no person is entitled to carry on his or her business on the pretext that the said business is that of another. Being based on this larger principle that no person can claim his business to be that of the other and misrepresent/ deceive, this ethos has been time and again affirmed by the Supreme Court, echoing that passing off right is a broader remedy than infringement. Another important factor that weighed with the Supreme Court in holding that a registrant of a trademark can sue another registrant of the trademark for passing off, was that registration merely recognizes the rights which are already pre-existing in common law and does not create any rights. In this context, I may also allude to the observations of Division Bench of this Court in Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50 and of the Bombay High Court in Sunder Parmanand Lalwani v. Caltex (India) Ltd., 1965 SCC OnLine Bom 151.",

In this context, it would be apposite to refer to paras 30.4 and 30.5 from the judgment in S. Syed Mohideen (supra), which are extracted herein for ready reference:  “30.4. Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides that nothing in this Act shall entitle the registered proprietor or registered user to interfere with the rights of prior user. Conjoint reading of Sections 34, 27 and 28 would show that the rights of registration are subject to Section 34 which can be seen from the opening words of Section 28 of the Act which states “Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor….” and also the opening words of Section 34 which states “Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere….” Thus, the scheme of the Act is such where rights of prior user are recognised superior than that of the registration and even the registered proprietor cannot disturb/interfere with the rights of prior user. The overall effect of collective reading of the provisions of the Act is that the action for passing off which is premised on the rights of prior user generating a goodwill shall be unaffected by any registration provided under the Act. This proposition has been discussed in extenso in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn.",

Co. 1996 SCC OnLine Del 599, a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court held that in between two parties claiming actual user as against the prior user, the party, who is prior in point of time, will have advantage over the other. Even with regard to  prior registration of the trademark, as against the prior user, rights of the latter will prevail. In an action for passing off, in order to succeed in getting an interim injunction, Plaintiff has to establish user of the mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the Defendant. It was further held that registration of the mark prior in point of time of the Defendant to user by the Plaintiff is irrelevant in an action for passing off as mere presence of the mark in the Register maintained by the Trade Marks Registry does not prove its user by the person in whose name the mark is registered. In this context, I may also refer to the following passage from the judgment in  “14. Thus, the law is pretty well-settled that in order to succeed at this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action of passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks.”",

There is no sale invoice or any other documentary evidence to support sales for the period prior to the said date. Therefore, the material on record prima facie supports the Plaintiff’s case that it is the prior user of the trademark ‘SOMANY’ albeit with respect to tiles compared to the Defendants, whose  user with respect to water heaters/geysers is from a subsequent date.

Great emphasis was laid by the learned counsel for the respondents on the underlined portion to say that there should be some similarity or co-relationship between the two products. This argument is supplemented by another argument that the plaintiff was not producing any goods like foam or analogous product. Consequently, there was no question of any deception being practised on the purchaser of foam materials in the market. This argument loses sight of an important feature viz., how would a lay customer know in the first place that the plaintiff was not producing foam or foam material? How would the customers know that Bata were not producing foam? It is well known that the name represented makers of shoes and analogous products, but a question would also arise in the mind of the lay customers whether Bata were also producing foam. Who is going to answer this question? Does an ordinary customer ask the seller as to whose product it is? The answer generally is in the negative. He buys a thing on the basis of his own impression.",

The expression ‘common field of activity’ was coined by Wynne-Parry J. in McCulloch v. Levis A. May (Product Distributors) Ltd. polularly known as ‘Uncle Mac’ case reported in 65 RPC 58 in which he held that its presence or absence was conclusive in determining whether or not there was passing off. However, the requirement that a ‘common field of activity’ is conclusive in determining whether there can be passing off has been extensively criticised by Manning J. in the case of Henderson v. Radio Corp. Pty. reportded in (1969) RPC 218 holding that it would be unsafe to adopt the view expressed in McCulloch v. Mary that what has been called a common field of activity must be established in every case to entitle the plaintiff to succeed. He further held that it is going too far to say that the absence of this so-called common field of activity necessarily bars a plaintiff from relief. With the passage of time, law on requirement of common field of activity in a passing off action has radically changed. There is no requirement for a common field of activity to found a claim in passing off. In Marage Studies v. Counter Feat Clothing Co. Ltd. reported in (1991) FSR 145, Browne Wilkison V-C said that the so-called requirement of the law that there should be a common field of activity is now discredited. The real question in each case is whether there is as a result of misrepresentation a real likelihood of confusion or deception of the public and consequent damage to the plaintiff. The focus is shifted from the external objective test of making comparison of activities of parties to the state of mind of public in deciding whether it will  be confused. With the passage of time and reputation acquired, the trade mark ‘Kirloskar’ has acquired the secondary meaning and has become almost a household word. The judgments relied upon by Mr. Kane pertain to the cases of one type of business and not where variety of businesses have been carried by the plaintiff and defendant as in the instant case. The business activities of the Respondents vary from pin to piano as borne out from the object clauses of the Memorandums of Association of the Respondents. The Appellants have still to commence their business activities but as mentioned in the Memorandums of Association of 1st Appellant in each appeal, some of the object clauses therein over lap with the activities of Respondents and more particularly of Respondents Nos. 6 and 7.",

In the instant case, the Respondents have established that word ‘Kirloskar’ has become a household word and their businesses cover variety of activities and that there is even a common connection with some activities of the Respondents and activities of the Appellants. In the case of Albion Motor Car Company Ltd. v. Albion Carriage and Motor Body Works Ltd. (34 RPC 257) (supra) on which reliance has been placed by Mr. Tulzapurkar, it has been held that the Defendant Company's business had not been proved to be the same class of business as that of the Plaintiff Company, yet the probability of confusion between the two companies, both being connected with the motor car industry, was proved and injunction was granted. In that case, the Plaintiff Company carried business in a large way as makers of engines and chassis of commercial and other motor-cars, their goods being identified and known to the trade by the name ‘Albion’ for which they had two Trade Marks. The defendants did not make motor cars or manufacture engines or chassis. In the action, the  plaintiffs alleged that the use of the word ‘Albion’ in the title under which the defendants company was later on incorporated was calculated to deceive and lead to the belief that the defendant Company was a branch of or connected with the plaintiff company.",

It is further held that there are names and marks which have become household word ‘Benz’ as name of a car would be known to every family that has ever used a quality car. The name ‘Benz’ as applied to a car, has a unique place in the World. Thus the boxes in which the defendant sells undergarments for men, and the representation therein is of a man with his legs separated and hands joined together above his shoulder, all within a circle indicate, the strong suggestion of a link between the three pointed star of ‘Mercedes Benz’ car and the undergarments sold by the defendant. This cannot be considered to be a ‘honest concurrent user’ by the defendant of the said symbol and hence, the defendant could be restrained from using the word ‘Benz’ with reference to any underwear which is manufactured by the defendant.”",

                        "content": "The facts of the present case prima facie lead me to hold that the trademark SOMANY has acquired distinctiveness and with the passage of time has become a household name. The averments in the plaint prima facie are clear pointers to the extensive and continuous user of the trademark as well as the reputation earned by the Plaintiff. The details furnished on record such as the annual sales turnover, expenditure incurred on promotions and advertisements, niche clientele of the Plaintiff etc. are evidence to the fact that Plaintiff has garnered huge reputation over the last 5 decades and the trademark SOMANY has become closely associated to the Plaintiff and none else. Exports to nearly 67 countries also evidences cross-border reputation. Therefore, applying the principles elucidated in the aforesaid judgments to the present case, it can be safely held that even if the Defendants’ goods are not similar/allied or cognate to those of the Plaintiff, there is a likelihood of confusion in the public that the goods emanate from the Plaintiff or there is a close connection/association between the goods and  the Plaintiff. It was observed by the Court in the case of Bata India (supra) that the argument of dissimilarity of goods in case of a reputed or prominent/well known mark, loses sight of the fact that a customer may not know that Bata was not producing foam or foam material even though the mark was well-known in the context of shoes and analogous products. Applying the same analogy to the trademark SOMANY, there is likelihood of unwary purchasers buying the goods of the Defendants with an identical mark under an impression that they are manufactured and sold by the Plaintiff or are at least associated with the Plaintiff. Therefore, there is no merit in the contention that the dissimilarity in tiles and water heaters/geysers is a singular factor which will defeat the claim of the Plaintiff for passing off, if it is otherwise able to prove so.",

Later, Plaintiff also expanded its business into selling water heaters/geysers and obtained registration on 31.07.2018. This fact is important in the context of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Laxmikant (supra), where it was held that Courts have to be mindful of future expansion of the business of a proprietor of a trademark. Plaintiff is right in its contention that merely because a trademark registration is applied for in a particular class, the proprietor is forever bound to sell only those goods. Law recognises the expansion of business into similar or cognate or allied goods and this factor is relevant for determination of a claim for passing off.",

Para 995 from Halsbury in Laws of England, Third Edition, Vol. 38, is relevant in this context and is as under:- “995. Nature of legal right. Although, apart from statute there is no property in a name or mark as such, it is a principle of law that no trader has any right to represent his goods as the goods of somebody else. As a corollary to this, no trader, who has in his hands the goods of a second trader, or his goods of a particular class or quality, has a right to represent those goods to be the goods of a third trader or of the second trader but of a different quality or belonging to a different class…………”",

                        "content": "1539, the following principles in relation to the tort of passing off have been culled out, relying on judicial precedents: - “75. From the aforenoted decisions, the following clear principles emerge:  (i)  Passing off, though an action based on deceit, does not require the establishment of fraud as a necessary element to  sustain the action. Imitation or adoption, by the defendant, of the plaintiffs trade mark, in such manner as to cause confusion or deception in the mind of prospective customers, is sufficient.  (ii)  The principles for grant of injunction, in passing off actions, are the same as those which govern the grant of injunctions in other cases, i.e. the existence of a prima facie case, the balance of convenience, and the likelihood of irreparable loss in issuing to the plaintiff, were injunction not to be granted.  (iii)  Proof of actual damage is not necessary, to establish passing off. However, proof of misrepresentation is necessary, even if intent to misrepresent is not approved. The question of intent may, nevertheless, be relevant, when it comes to the ultimate relief to be granted to the plaintiff.  (iv)  Passing off may be alleged by a claimant who owns sufficient proprietary interest in the goodwill associated with the product, which is really likely to be damaged by the alleged misrepresentation.  (v)  Grant of injunction, in cases where passing off is found to exist, is intended to serve two purposes, the first being preservation of the reputation of the plaintiff, and the second, safeguarding of the public against goods which are “passed off as those of the plaintiff.  (vi)  The ingredients/indicia of the tort of passing off are the following:  (a)  There must be sale, by the defendant, of goods/services in a manner which is likely to deceive the public into thinking that the goods/services are those of the plaintiff.  (b)  The plaintiff is not required to prove long user to prove established reputation. The existence, or otherwise, of reputation, would depend upon the volume of the plaintiff’s sales and the extent of its advertisement.  (c)  The plaintiff is required to establish  (i)  misrepresentation by the defendant to the public, though not necessarily mala fide,  (ii)  likelihood of confusion in the minds of the public (the public being the potential customers/users of the product) that the goods of the defendant are those of the plaintiff, applying the test of a person of “imperfect recollection and ordinary memory”,  (iii)  loss, or likelihood of loss, and  (iv)  goodwill of the plaintiff, as a prior user.  Elsewhere, the five elements of passing off have been identified as (a) misrepresentation, (b) made by the trader in the course of trade, (c) to prospective customers or ultimate consumers of the goods or services supplied by him, (d) calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another (i.e. that such injury is reasonably foreseeable) and (e) actual damage, or the possibility of actual damage, to the business or goodwill of the plaintiff.  (vii)  In cases of alleged passing off, the Court, while examining the likelihood of causing confusion, is required to consider, in conjunction, inter alia,  (a)  the nature of the market,  (b)  the class of customers dealing in the product,  (c)  the extent of reputation possessed by the plaintiff,  (d)  the trade channels through which the product is made available to the customer and  (e)  the existence of connection in the course of trade. The Supreme Court has also held that, in passing off action on the basis of unregistered trade marks, the Court is required to assess the likelihood of deception or confusion by examining  (i)  the nature of the marks, i.e. whether there were demands/label marks/composite marks,  (ii)  the degree of similarity between the competing marks,  (iii)  the nature of the goods,  (iv)  the similarity in nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival parties,  (v)  the class of purchasers, and the degree of care which they would be expected to exercise while purchasing the goods, and  (vi)  the mode of purchasing the goods and placing orders.  (viii)  That the defendant is not producing the goods manufactured by the plaintiff may not be relevant, where the plaintiff' s mark is found to have sufficient reputation.  (ix)  Courts are required to be doubly vigilant where passing off is alleged in respect of pharmaceutical products, in view of the possibility of adverse effects resulting from administration of a wrong drug. For the said reason, the degree of proof is also lower, in the case of alleged passing of pharmaceutical products.  (x)  Passing off differs from infringement. Passing off is based on the goodwill that the trader has in his name, whereas infringement is based on the trader's proprietary right in the name, registered in his favour. Passing off is an action for deceit, involving passing off the goods of one person as those of another, whereas an action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for vindication of its exclusive right to use the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which registration has been granted. Use of the trade mark by the defendant is not necessary for infringement, but it is a sine qua non for passing off. Once sufficient similarity, as is likely to deceive, is shown, infringement stands established. Passing off, however, may be resisted on the ground of added material, such as packing, procurement through different trade channels, etc., which would distinguish the goods of the defendant from those of the plaintiff and belie the possibility of confusion or deception.”",

                        "content": "From the conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it is clear that first and foremost in order to succeed in getting an interim injunction on the ground of passing off, Plaintiff will have to establish a prima facie case that it enjoys goodwill and reputation of such a threshold that the Defendants by their misrepresentation are likely to pass off their goods as that of the Plaintiff. In the present case, Plaintiff has averred and argued that Plaintiff is one of the leading tiles manufacturing company in India. Its shares are listed with the Bombay Stock Exchange as well as National Stock Exchange of India Limited and as on 19.10.2021 the market capitalisation was over Rs.3537 crores. Plaintiff operates from about 6 depots and about 10,000 touch points across the country, which include showrooms/display centres/dealers/sub-dealers etc. being run under Plaintiff’s brand ‘SOMANY’ exhibiting array of products. Quality of the products offered by the Plaintiff has enabled it to make reputed Institutions like Tata Projects Limited, Larsen and Toubro Limited, DLF Ltd., Ashiana Housing, Adani Township and Real Estate Co. Pvt. Ltd. Etc. its clients. Substantial amount of revenue is earned by the Plaintiff from export of its product overseas to more than 67 countries across the world. Plaintiff has emerged as the second largest tile manufacturing company in the country. Plaintiff has received two prestigious Power Brand Awards for the years 2011 and 2012, besides the ‘Spotlight Award’, Corporate Technical Achievement Award from American Ceramic Society, etc. Plaintiff has expended substantial sums of money and resources in advertising and protecting the said trademark and has eventually expanded from tiles to other cognate and allied products. The sales turnover is indicative of the extensive reputation and goodwill in the market for nearly five decades. Interestingly none of these averments have  been refuted by the Defendants except for a vague denial in the Written Statement stating that the averments made in the plaint are self-serving, boastful, devoid of merit and cooked up stories.",

                        "content": "In my prima facie view, the documents placed by the Plaintiff in support of the aforesaid averments show that the trademark ‘SOMANY’ enjoys immense reputation and goodwill in India and this apparently was a good reason for the Defendants to dishonestly adopt the trademark ‘SOMANY’ so as to encash on the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff. Before proceeding further, I may only refer to a paragraph from a judgment of Division Bench of this Court in Prius Auto Industries Ltd. (supra), which was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court and is as under:- “21. It is trite that trade marks serve the dual purpose of securing to the proprietor the benefits of a good reputation, which in turn help foster competition and innovation, while conveying product and proprietor information to the consumer. A trade mark represents facets of a business's goodwill, symbolizing inter-alia a consistent quality and a reputation for service, and this goodwill forms the primary basis for consumer choice among competing brands. Thus, what is protected under trade mark law is not the mark itself but what the mark symbolizes: a firm's goodwill. In effect, a trade mark is a distinguishing mark allowing a firm with a good reputation to intimate to consumers that a certain good belongs to them, and consequently, trade mark law seeks to prevent other firms from imitating this mark and trading on another firm's reputation. Thus, a trade mark's legal existence is inextricably entwined with the goodwill it symbolizes. As elucidated by the Supreme Court of the United States in its decision reported as 248 U.S. 90 (1918) United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., “In truth, a trade mark confers no monopoly whatever in a proper sense, but is merely a convenient means for facilitating the protection of one's good-will in trade by placing a  distinguishing mark or symbol-a commercial signature-upon the merchandise or the package in which it is sold.”",

                        "content": "Comparing the two competing marks, there is no doubt that the impugned mark is identical to the trademark of the Plaintiff. The question that needs to be posed at this stage is whether there is a valid cause of action set up in the plaint so as to show misrepresentation by the Defendants to prospective customers, in course of trade as well as an injury to the goodwill and reputation of the Plaintiff. Before proceeding further, in this context, I may refer to para 998 from Halsbury Law of England Vol. 38 (Third Edition) as under:- “998. Essentials of the cause of action. The plaintiff must prove that the disputed name, mark, sign or get up has become distinctive of his goods in the sense that by the use of his name or mark, etc., in relation to goods they are regarded, by a substantial number of members of the public or in the trade, as coming from a particular source, known or unknown; it is not necessary that the name of the plaintiff's firm should be known……… The plaintiff must further prove that the defendant's use of name or mark was likely or calculated to deceive, and thus cause confusion and injury, actual or probable, to the goodwill of the plaintiff's business, as for example, by depriving him of the profit that he might have had by selling the goods which ex hypothesi, the purchaser intended to buy. Thus, the cause of action involves a combination of distinctiveness of the plaintiff's name or mark and an injurious use by the defendant of the name or mark or a similar name or mark, how far the defendant's use of any mark, sign, picture or get-up does or does not amount to passing off is in substance a question of evidence; the question whether the matter complained of is likely to deceive is a question for the court.”",

In the absence of any plausible and satisfactory explanation by the Defendants, adoption of the trademark ‘SOMANY’ cannot in my prima facie view be held to be honest and bonafide. It is a settled law that no amount of user can be a justification or an explanation for dishonest adoption and the present case is a textbook example prima facie of a dishonest adoption, where despite having knowledge of the trademark ‘SOMANY’ used by the Plaintiff for several years and its repute in the market, Defendants chose to adopt the same. Relevant in this regard would be to refer to a judgment of this Court in  Rolex SA v. Alex Jewellery Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 1619 where the Defendant had adopted the trademark ‘ROLEX’ of the Plaintiff, who had coined the mark ‘ROLEX’ and had extensive use spanning across a century with immense goodwill and reputation. The explanation given was that ‘ROL’ is derived from Rolled Gold used for manufacturing jewellery and the suffix ‘EX’ is derived from the name of Mr. Joseph Mudailyar’s son Alex, who was the Director of Defendant No. 1. The Court finding the explanation to be false and an afterthought observed as under:  “25. …..The explanation given by defendant No. 1 about the adoption of the trade mark ROLEX to the effect that ‘ROL’ is derived from rolled gold used for manufacturing its products and ‘EX’ is derived from the suffix of Mr. Joseph Mudailyar's son Alex (Mr. Mudaliyar being the director of Defendant No. 1) is false. Such an explanation is absolutely an afterthought and without any basis and reason. The fact that ROLEX is an invented trade mark adopted and extensively used worldwide  and in India by plaintiff much prior to defendant No. 1. Such adoption/use of the trade mark ROLEX is dishonest, tainted and cannot be of any avail to defendants or justify their continued use of the trade mark/name Rolex. Using the said highly reputed trademark is a fraud itself within the knowledge of the defendants. No amount of user, justification or explanation can purify the bad intention of the defendants. It is a matter of fact that despite having knowledge of and in any event being put on notice of plaintiff's prior statutory and proprietary rights in the registered and reputed trade mark ROLEX, defendant No. 1 has with impunity continued to violate the rights of plaintiff. Such continued misuse of the defendant No. 1 is at its own peril and any claims on such basis are unsustainable. Defendant No. 1 cannot be permitted to take advantage of its dishonest adoption and continued unauthorized use of the trade mark ROLEX despite knowledge of plaintiff's rights.”",

Vide interim order dated 17th August, 2021an interim injunction was granted restraining the Defendants from using the mark •Delhi Public School•/•DPS• or any other mark which is identical or deceptively similar thereto, including the •DPIS• mark. The operative portion of the said order dated 17th August, 2021, is set out below:  •12. The Court thus finds a prima facie case in favour of the Plaintiff. They are a prior adopter, user and owner since 1948, and the prior registered proprietor of well-known trademarks 'Delhi Public School' and 'DPS'. The use of the impugned mark-'Delhi Public International School'/ 'DPIS' and the impugned logo, is deceptively similar to the mark of the Plaintiff-Society and is in breach/ violation of the decree passed by this Court against Mr. Pal. The adoption of the impugned marks is thus prima facie invalid. Besides, considering that parties are in the field of education, deliberate adoption by the Defendants of impugned trade marks and logo that are deceptively similar and/or identical to the Plaintiffs registered trade marks/names and logos can cause confusion in the minds of the parents, prospective students and staff desirous of securing admission or availing services, seeing the advertisements, promotional material, admission forms, boards/ hoardings, etc. They are bound to be misled into availing the services of the Defendant-School, under the belief that they are those of the Plaintiff-Society. Mr. Mittal has demonstrated that the Defendant-School has intentionally misrepresented itself to be in association with the Plaintiff-Society due to the prominence of 'Delhi Public School'. Further, the registered trade mark of Plaintiff-Society-'Delhi Public School'/ 'DPS' and the crest logo can be perceived by general public as indicative of the source of 'Delhi Public School' being the Plaintiff-Society.  Therefore, the Court considers it necessary to grant an interim injunction in favour of the Plaintiff-Society.",

The said order was only clarified later to the extent that the Defendants therein were allowed to use the logo they sought to do so after deleting certain words.

In fact, a representative of the Plaintiff purchased a sample product from the Defendants on 10.05.2018, which confirmed their dealing in counterfeit products bearing the Plaintiff’s trademarks.

The photographs on record clearly evidence that the intent of the Defendants was to pass off their goods as that of the Plaintiff and case of passing off stands established.

Out of the said sales, sales in Asia Pacific region alone accounted for 40 per cent sales of the Group. Defendants by their illegal acts have caused substantial loss to the Plaintiff and at the same time have earned profits to unjustly enrich themselves. PW-1 further testified that Defendants have been illegally selling the products such as men’s wallet bearing the trademark MONTBLANC in conjunction with the Star Device for Rs. 1,000/-as can be seen from PW-1/18 and PW-1/19. Even if it is assumed that Defendants sold five pieces of the said product every single day, they have illegally earned Rs. 5,000/-each day, which in a year would amount to Rs. 18,25,000/-. Since the Defendants do not invest on sourcing or production of these products, the margin of profits is extremely high and it can be assumed that at least 70 per cent of the total sale value is earned as profit, which comes to Rs. 12,77,500/-per year and therefore in two years Defendants would have earned at least Rs. 25,55,000/-. It is further deposed that Plaintiff’s wallets are priced at minimum of Rs. 20,000/-and thus Defendants have caused an incalculable loss to reputation and goodwill which can be estimated at Rs. 2,00,05,000/-.",

The comparative labels set out hereinabove show that the two products have startling similarities. Some of the features, which are similar, are set out below:  A.  The Defendant’s pillow pack is of the same blue/purple background and of the same size as that of the Plaintiffs’.  B.  The Plaintiffs’ pillow pack has a brown oval at the centre, while the Defendant has placed a diamond in brown colour at the centre.   C.  The Plaintiffs have displayed the origin of the product i.e., the name of the manufacturer as ‘CADBURY’S’ on the top left corner of the pillow pack. The Defendant has placed its name ‘NEERAJ’ in an identical manner and positioning at the top left corner, as that of the Plaintiffs.  D.  The brown oval on the Plaintiffs’ pillow pack is bordered by a blue/purple oval while the brown diamond on the Defendant’s pillow pack is also bordered with the blue/purple border.  E.  The Plaintiffs have inscribed the trade mark ‘GEMS’ in the colour white, and the Defendant has used an identical white for writing ‘JAMES BOND’.  F.  Further, the Defendant has also copied the Plaintiffs’ scripting of the trade mark ‘GEMS’ on the pillow pack. The trade mark ‘GEMS’ is written in an uneven script and the Defendant has also placed ‘JAMES BOND’ in an uneven script.  G.  Just as the Plaintiffs, the Defendant has also created a visual impression of an explosion in blue/purple colour in the middle with lines emanating from the centre and tablets flying out.  H.  The colour combination of the tablets adopted by the Defendant is also similar to that of the Plaintiffs.  I.  The Defendant has also placed half chocolate-tablets showing the chocolate centre in the exact same manner as the Plaintiffs.  J.  Additionally, the Defendant has conceptualized the impugned product ‘JAMES BOND’ by being inspired by the character  namely ‘GEMS BOND’, as used by the Plaintiffs for promotion of their ‘GEMS’ branded products, as submitted hereinabove.",

                        "content": "In two seminal judgements of the Supreme Court, the test of infringement and deceptive similarity of competing marks is well settled. The Supreme Court in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968, has observed that the said question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. It was observed that, to such a man, the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them. The relevant extracts from the judgment in Corn Products (supra) are set out below:  “18. We think that the view taken by Desai, J., is right. It is well known that the question whether the two marks are likely to give rise to confusion or not is a question of first impression. It is for the court to decide that question. English cases proceeding on the English way of pronouncing an English word by Englishmen, which it may be stated is not always the same, may not be of much assistance in our country in deciding questions of phonetic similarity. It cannot be overlooked that the word is an English word which to the mass of the Indian people is a foreign word. It is well recognised that in deciding a question of similarity between two marks, the marks have to be considered as a whole. So considered, we are inclined to agree with Desai, J., that the marks with which this case is concerned are similar. Apart from the syllable “co” in the appellant's mark, the two marks are identical. That syllable is not in our opinion such as would enable the buyers in our country to distinguish the one mark from the other.",

The Aquamatic case (Harry Reynolds v. Laffeaty's Ld.) is a recent case where the test of the commonness of the idea between two marks was applied in deciding the question of similarity between them. Again, in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks we have to approach it from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and of imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the similarity of the idea in the two marks is reasonably likely to cause a confusion between them.”",

The relevant extracts of the said judgment, which has been followed in innumerable judgments subsequently, are set out hereinbelow:  “According to Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (9th Edition Paragraph 838) “Two marks, when placed side by side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person acquainted with the one mark, and not having the two side by side for comparison, might well be deceived, if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark, into a belief that he was dealing with goods which bore the same mark as that with which he was acquainted.  It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trademarked goods, and relying, as they frequently do, upon marks, should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing. Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own.  It is therefore clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him.”",

                        "content": "Similar is the view taken by the ld. Single Judge of this Court in ITC Ltd. v. Brittania Industries Ltd. [233 (2016) DLT 259], wherein the Plaintiff sought to restrain the Defendant from violating its rights in the Plaintiff’s packaging/trade dress of ‘Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive – All Good’ biscuit by using a deceptively and confusingly similar trade dress for its ‘Nutri Choice Digestive Zero’ biscuit. On the aspect of deception and confusion, the Court placed reliance upon Parle Products (supra) and observed as under:  “36. Biscuits are normally stacked on shelves in a grocery shop or a supermarket. Usually there is an entire section where the biscuits of different manufacturers are arranged side by side. Where the product is an eatable like a biscuit, the colour and the colour scheme of the packaging plays an important role in the consumer making an initial choice and in enabling a discerning consumer to locate the particular brand of a manufacturer. The aspect of 'initial interest' was explained by this Court in Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani as under:  \"In some case, however, it is also possible that such a purchaser after having been misled into an initial interest in a product  manufactured by an imitator discovers his folly, but this initial interest being based on confusion and deception can give rise to a cause of action for the tort of passing off as the purchaser has been made to think that there is some connection or nexus between the products and business of two disparate companies.\"",

                        "content": "Therefore, when another competing variant of the biscuit is introduced six months later and a consumer on the basis of the popularity of a product that has recently been introduced makes a mistake as to which packet of biscuit he is picking up, it can be argued that the initial interest was based on confusion and deception and, therefore, gives rise to a tort of passing off. In Wal Mart (supra) it was observed that the product's trade dress can be protected only if it is shown that it had acquired a secondary meaning \"since design, like colour, is not inherently distinctive.\" However, the product in that case was a certain kind of clothing. In that context, it was said that the colour by itself does not identify the source of the product. However, that may not be entirely true when it comes to products like biscuits. The packaging of a biscuit does become associated with the manufacturer or brand. The colour on the wrapper would certainly play an important part.",

                        "content": "Similar marks or features used in wrappers of competing biscuits was the subject matter of Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J.P. & Co. (supra). The Appellants there owned certain registered trademarks one of which was \"Glucose\" and was used on their half pound biscuit packets. Another registered trade mark was a wrapper with its colour scheme, general set up and entire collocation of words. The wrapper was of buff colour and depicted a farm yard with a girl in the centre carrying a pail of water and cows and hens around her on the background of a farmyard house and trees. The Respondent's wrapper contained a picture of a girl  supporting with one hand a bundle of hay on her head and carrying a sickle and a bundle of food in the other, the cows and hens surrounding her. The trial court declined the injunction. The High Court looking at the broad features did not think that they were so similar so as to deceive an ordinary purchaser. Since it was an action for infringement, the Supreme Court declined to treat it as a case of passing off. Nevertheless, it explained that in order to come to a conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another \"the broad and essential features of the two are to be considered.\" It was further explained as under:  \"They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not identical bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the other with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens in the foreground. In the background there is a farm house with a fence. The word \"Gluco Biscuits\" in one and \"Glucose Biscuits\" on the other occupy a prominent place at the top with a good deal of similarity between the two writings. Anyone in, our opinion who has a look at one of the packets to-day may easily mistake the other if shown on another day as being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the plaintiffs goods, he might easily mistake the defendants' wrapper for the plaintiffs if shown to him some time after he had seen the plaintiffs'. After all, an ordinary purchaser is not gifted  with the powers of observation of a Sherlock Holmes. We have therefore no doubt that the defendants' wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs' which was registered.\" (emphasis supplied)",

The ‘GEMS’ product is also usually consumed by small children, both in urban and rural areas. The test in such a matter is not that of absolute confusion. Even likelihood of confusion is sufficient. A comparison of the Defendant’s infringing product and the packaging thereof leaves no manner of doubt that the same is a complete knock-off, of the Plaintiffs’ ‘CADBURY GEMS’. The significant fact is that these products are sold not only in bigger packs, but also in smaller pillow packs, due to which the mark may not even be fully visible. The smallest selling unit of the Plaintiffs’ product i.e., the pillow pack, is even available for 1 rupee to 5 rupees. Hence, the product’s get up, layout, as also, the colour combination of the packaging plays a significant role at the point of purchase. Moreover, chocolates are sold not merely in big retail stores or outlets, but also, in road side shacks, paan shops, patri vendors, kirana stores and stalls outside schools, etc. Thus, there is an immense likelihood of confusion, particularly considering the class of consumers that the product is targeted at, that is, children.",

In view of the evidence led by the Plaintiffs and the foregoing discussion as to the blatant infringement of the Plaintiffs’ trademark and copyright, the present two issues are answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, Issue Nos.1 and 2 are decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  In view of the contumacious conduct of the Defendant in infringing the well-known mark, label and packaging of the Plaintiffs, this Court is convinced that the present is a fit case for the award of damages. Accordingly, Issue No.3 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  The Plaintiffs have placed on record the certified copies of the legal proceeding certificates relating to the trade mark registrations in respect of its ‘GEMS’ product obtained in India. The same are exhibited as Ex.PW 1/3 (Colly). A perusal of the same establishes that the Plaintiffs are the registered proprietor of the marks as mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Plaint. Accordingly, Issue No.4 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  The Plaintiffs have placed on record the certified copies of the copyright registration certificates for its artistic works in respect of the character ‘GEMS BOND’. The same is exhibited as Ex.PW 1/6 (Colly). After perusing the said copyright registrations, the present issue is answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, Issue No.5 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  Issue Nos.6 and 7 are taken together. This Court has perused the ex parte evidence filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs. The discussion above clearly shows that the acts of the Defendant constitute infringement of registered trademarks of the Plaintiffs, as also, passing off. Accordingly, Issue Nos.6 and 7 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  The packaging/mark/label of the Defendant are a substantial imitation and similar to the Plaintiffs’ mark/label/packaging. The onus to prove the differences is on the Defendant. As discussed above, no substantial defence has been taken by the Defendant in its written statement, except for claiming that the Defendant’s products are different from the Plaintiffs’ product. No advertisement or other documents have been placed on record and no  evidence has been led by the Defendant. Accordingly, Issue No.8 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.  The Defendant has failed to establish that the Plaintiffs’ mark ‘CADBURY GEMS’/‘GEMS’ is common to trade. The present issue is answered in the negative. Accordingly, Issue No.9 is decided in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendant.",

In view of this finding, the Trial Court concluded that since both the parties are equally placed in terms of registration and sail in the same boat, Appellant has no prima facie case for grant of injunction. For ready reference, relevant part of the impugned order is extracted hereunder:- “21.

Raj Kumar Motan Das Ahuja who is resident of Thane (East), Mumbai and label RINGO is not registered in the name of any other person  including the plaintiff and defendant. Though the plaintiff has filed on record photocopy of legal notice issued to the defendant but from the documents it is clear that plaintiff is not registered owner of the trade mark RINGO and copy right RINGO label and he is standing on the same footing as the defendant is standing against the registered owner of the trade mark RINGO. Therefore, in my considered opinion, both the plaintiff and defendant are sailing in the same boat as both are not registered owner of the trade mark and copy right in relation to the trade mark RINGO and RINGO label.

It can hardly be disputed or debated that once a party raises and presses a claim before a Court of Law, the same is required to be determined and adjudicated upon. It was incumbent upon the Trial Court to have adjudicated the claim of passing off, before taking a decision on the  application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC preferred by the Respondent as well as application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC preferred by the Appellant. It goes without saying that had the Trial Court considered the said relief and the arguments made thereon, the decision may have been otherwise. Section 27 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 clearly provides that while no person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent infringement of an unregistered trademark, but nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect the rights of action against any person for passing off goods or services as the goods of another person or services, provided by another person. As held in Satyam Infoway Ltd. V. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC 145, expression ‘passing off’ itself suggests that it is to restrain the Defendant from passing off its goods to the public as that of the Plaintiff and is an action not only to preserve the reputation of the Plaintiff but also to safeguard public interest. In N.R. Dongre & Others v. Whirlpool  Corporation and Another, AIR 1995 Del 300, it was held that under Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, a prior user of a trademark can maintain an action for passing off against any subsequent user of an identical trademark and registration of Plaintiff’s trademark is not a sine qua non for an action based on passing off. Therefore, even if the Appellant’s trademark is unregistered, it was entitled to lay a claim for passing off and the Trial Court ought to have considered the same. A major fallacy that is glaringly noticeable in the impugned order is that the Trial Court has not even dealt with the claim of passing off, leave alone taking a prima facie view qua the said relief.",

                        "content": "Considering that the application seeking permission to file the rectification had already been moved prior to the framing of the issues in the suit, this Court is clearly of the opinion that when an application under Section 124 of the Act is filed, the Court would have to prima facie find as to whether leave is to be granted to file the rectification petition or not. Thereafter, the Court shall arrive at a finding as to whether the grounds raised by the said rectification petition are tenable or not. This is also the settled legal position, as held by the ld. Full Bench of this Court in Data Infosys Ltd. & Ors. v. Infosys Technologies Ltd., 2016 (65) PTC 209 Delhi FB. The said position was thereafter also upheld by the Supreme Court in Patel Field Marshal Agencies & Anr. v. P.M Diesels Ltd., (2018) 2 SCC 112. The relevant extract of the said decision reads as under:  “20. The issue arose once again before the Delhi High Court in Data Infosys Limited (supra) which was referred to a Full Bench, perhaps, for a closer look into the matter in view of the conflict of opinions in Astrazeneca UK Ltd. (supra) and B. Mohamed Yousuff (supra). After an elaborate consideration of the matter, the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court concluded that where registration of a trade mark is questioned after initiation of a suit for infringement it is open for the party  setting up the plea of invalidity to apply to the IPAB under Sections 47 and 57 of the 1999 Act for rectification. The High Court went on to hold that the effect of the prima facie evaluation of the tenability of the plea of invalidity does not impinge on the right of the party raising such a plea to apply to the IPAB for rectification. In other words, the right to seek rectification under Sections 47 and 57 of the 1999 Act does not stand extinguished in a situation where in a suit for infringement the plea of invalidity is found to be prima facie not tenable. The only difference according to the High Court is that while under Sections 47 and 57 of the 1999 Act, the aggrieved party can move the Registrar for rectification, in the latter situation i.e. where a suit is pending it is the IPAB which alone acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of the Registrar.  …",

The Civil Court, in fact, is not empowered by the Act to decide the said question. Furthermore, the Act mandates that the decisions rendered by the prescribed statutory authority [Registrar/High Court (now IPAB)] will bind the Civil Court. At the same time, the Act (both old and new) goes on to provide a different procedure to govern the exercise of the same jurisdiction in two different situations. In a case where the issue of invalidity is raised or arises independent of a suit, the prescribed statutory authority will be the sole authority to deal with the matter. However, in a situation where a suit is pending (whether instituted before or after the filing of a rectification application) the exercise of jurisdiction by the prescribed statutory authority is contingent on a finding of the Civil Court as regards the prima facie  tenability of the plea of invalidity.  …",

The requirement of satisfaction of the civil Court regarding the existence of a prima facie case of invalidity and the framing of an issue to that effect before the law operates to vest jurisdiction in the statutory authority to deal with the issue of invalidity by no means, tantamount to permission or leave of the civil court, as has been contended. It is a basic requirement to further the cause of justice by elimination of false, frivolous and untenable claims of invalidity that may be raised in the suit.”",

It was urged that:  (a)  Appellant falsely represented that it is the registered proprietor of the trademark ‘RINGO’, whereas as a matter of record, the application for registration of the trademark filed in the year 1999 was objected to and the rejection was communicated vide letter dated 18.12.2014 and the application is no longer pending; (b) Appellant not being a registered owner of the trademark ‘RINGO’ has no statutory rights to file the present suit;  (c)  Respondents are prior users of the trademark ‘RING’ and have been engaged in business since 2011, which is evident from the TIN No. granted to the Respondents; (d) Balance-sheets of the Appellant for the year 2012 albeit indicate some sales for an amount of Rs.10,00,000/-, but the invoices filed in support of the claim do not contain CST number, which is compulsory for a turnover of more than Rs.5,00,000/-in a year, under the sales tax regime and the invoices are thus fabricated; (e) the invoices produced by the Appellant do not contain TIN No. and even the machinery  as well as the spices are evidently purchased in the year 2015 and thus the claim to prior user from 2011, set up by the Appellant, is totally false; and  (f)  Trial Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit.",

In view of this finding, the Trial Court concluded that since both the parties are equally placed in terms of registration and sail in the same boat, Appellant has no prima facie case for grant of injunction. For ready reference, relevant part of the impugned order is extracted hereunder:- “21. On the other hand certain documents has been filed by defendant showing that application of the plaintiff has been  objected to by office of Registrar of Trade Mark and defendant has also filed on record the documents showing that the label RINGO is registered with the name of Sh. Raj Kumar Motan Das Ahuja who is resident of Thane (East), Mumbai and label RINGO is not registered in the name of any other person including the plaintiff and defendant. Though the plaintiff has filed on record photocopy of legal notice issued to the defendant but from the documents it is clear that plaintiff is not registered owner of the trade mark RINGO and copy right RINGO label and he is standing on the same footing as the defendant is standing against the registered owner of the trade mark RINGO. Therefore, in my considered opinion, both the plaintiff and defendant are sailing in the same boat as both are not registered owner of the trade mark and copy right in relation to the trade mark RINGO and RINGO label. Therefore in my considered opinion, plaintiff has no prime facie case.",

That under the facts and circumstances of the present case, the plaintiff prays that this Hon’ble Court may kindly be pleased to:  (a) .

Passing off and violation of the plaintiffs right in the trademark/label RINGO.  (ii) .

                        "content": "Trial Court has completely overlooked the fact that the Appellant has sought a relief of passing off and erred in not even dealing with the said claim. It can hardly be disputed or debated that once a party raises and  presses a claim before a Court of Law, the same is required to be determined and adjudicated upon. It was incumbent upon the Trial Court to have adjudicated the claim of passing off, before taking a decision on the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC preferred by the Respondents as well as application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC preferred by the Appellant. It goes without saying that had the Trial Court considered the said relief and the arguments made thereon, the decision may have been otherwise. Section 27 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 clearly provides that while no person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent infringement of an unregistered trademark, but nothing in the Act shall be deemed to affect the rights of action against any person for passing off goods or services as the goods of another person or services, provided by another person. As held in Satyam Infoway Ltd. V. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC 145, expression ‘passing off’ itself suggests that it is to restrain the Defendant from passing off its goods to the public as that of the Plaintiff and is an action not only to preserve the reputation of the Plaintiff but also to safeguard public interest. In N.R. Dongre & Others v. Whirlpool Corporation and Another, AIR 1995 Del 300, it was held that under Section 27(2) of the Trade Marks Act, a prior user of a trademark can maintain an action for passing off against any subsequent user of an identical trademark and registration of Plaintiff’s trademark is not a sine qua non for an action based on passing off. Therefore, even if the Appellant’s trademark is unregistered, it was entitled to lay a claim for passing off and the Trial Court ought to have considered the same. A major fallacy that is glaringly noticeable in the impugned order is that the Trial  Court has not even dealt with the claim of passing off, leave alone taking a prima facie view qua the said relief.",
