In that case, the Supreme Court held as under:  “15. The findings of the High Court raise a question of great importance to the student community. Normally, one would be inclined to the view, especially if one has been a paper-setter and an examiner, that the key answer furnished by the paper-setter and accepted by the University as correct, should not be allowed to be challenged. One way of achieving it is not to publish the key answer at all. If the University had not published the key answer along with the result of the Test, no controversy would have arisen in this case. But that is not a correct way of looking at these matters which involve the future of hundreds of students who are aspirants for admission to professional courses. If the key answer were kept secret in this case, the remedy would have been worse than the disease because, so many students would have had to suffer the injustice in silence. The publication of the key answer has unravelled an unhappy state of affairs to which the University and the State Government must find a solution. Their sense of fairness in publishing the key answer has given them an opportunity to have a closer look at the system of examinations which they conduct. What has failed is not the computer but the human system.",

The expression “demonstrably wrong” and the clapham omnibus standard or test on the second aspect (i.e. more than one correct key) is noticeably the corner stone of the said principle.

The examining body may have its reasons to support the answer as correct or most appropriate. If the Court finds the decision of the examining body to be capricious, arbitrary or actuated by malice, it would be apposite for this Court to exercise judicial review on merits. The examining body must have its full play in choosing the manner in which it conducts the examination including the evaluation criteria and process. Of course, the selection of questions and answers as well as the process in which the examination and evaluation is conducted must not be arbitrary or discriminatory. It is always possible that certain questions may have the propensity to confuse the candidates. It may also be possible to have another view regarding the correct answer.  However, the same is required to be considered by the examining body and cannot be the subject matter of review on merits.

                        "content": "It is also relevant to refer to the decision of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in H. Nowfal and Ors. v. Kerala Public Service Commission and Anr.: 2014 SCC OnLine Ker 12162. In that case, the court had highlighted the distinguishing feature between the case of Kanpur University v. Samir Gupta (supra) and other cases, where the courts had relied upon the view of the experts regarding the answer keys to examine the challenge to the evaluation, and the cases where the concerned authorities/examination bodies had adopted a procedure for inviting objections to draft answer keys and having the same evaluated by experts. In such cases, the procedure for the objections to be considered by the experts was inbuilt and therefore, would not warrant a judicial review on merits. The court held that in cases where such procedure is adopted, the scope of judicial review would be further restricted to cases where the action of the body is afflicted with palpable error or where it is found that the body of experts has not acted in a bona fide manner. The relevant observations of the court are set out below:  “11. What is a feature in the present case, which appears to us to distinguish it from the cases which are decided, is the procedure which is already put in place by the Public Service Commission. The judgments of the  Supreme Court relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner were rendered in a situation where the university and in one case the employer, conducted the examinations. There were complaints against the same which reached the courts. The courts took the views of the experts. It is relying on the decision of the experts, which were found convincing to the courts, that the courts granted relief. On the other hand, in these cases, as we have already noticed, the procedure evolved by the Commission pursuant to the direction of this Court was to publish provisional key, invite objections, get them scrutinised with the help of experts and act on the decision of the experts. Therefore this is precisely what the courts have done in the decisions which were relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners. What the petitioners would seek is a review of even the decision of experts to whom the matter is referred by the Commission under a procedure which is evolved. That, we think, may involve the court, which exercises judicial review, to sit in judgment over the experts and, more importantly, attract criticism that it is doing a review as an appellate court will do. At this juncture, it is very apposite to note that the petitioners do not have any case that the persons to whom the matter was referred by the Commission, seeking their opinion as experts, are not experts or they were in any manner actuated by malice. This means that the Commission took care by first publishing the provisional key, inviting objections, getting the objections scrutinised by the body of experts who must be treated as having acted bonafide. Further the result of that exercise, if it is sought to be subjected to further scrutiny, for the purpose of the exercise of judicial review, we would think that it may invite the criticism that the said exercise would be an appellate power exercised in disguise as judicial review. It is true that the Tribunal took the view that the Commission already having followed a procedure which is fair and which involved the scrutiny of the objections by the  Commission with reference to experts, the matter did not require interference. The Court or Tribunal doing judicial review should not reduce the exercise of judicial review power to that of appellate review and enter findings on facts for which it may not possess the expertise. If a view from among two views of the matter is taken then if it defers to one of the views this Court does not shun its jurisdiction. On the other hand it would be a restrained exercise of its discretion which would still be in exercise of its jurisdiction keeping it within the four walls of its jurisdiction.",

As is obvious, such a passing off action would be based on a plea that : the design, which is an unregistered mark, was being used by the plaintiff for the purposes of business; and that the plaintiff's goods and/or services had acquired a reputation and/or goodwill, which were identified in the minds of the consumers, by associating the design/the mark, with the goods and/or services.

The defendants had argued that the reasoning in Mohan Lal (supra) with respect to impermissibility of joinder of the claims vis-à-vis design infringement and passing off, is sound. In this regard it was argued that there are significant differences between causes of action relating to design infringement on the one hand, and those based on allegations of passing off. Defendants had argued that (i) design infringement is based on a statutory right, whereas passing off is a common law injury; (ii) the basis of the former is design of an article, for sale, whereas the latter is based on misrepresentation; (iii) Similarly, a design infringement suit alleges that the design is novel, not based on any previous publication in India, whereas the passing off suit has to establish that the shape or mark has developed substantial goodwill and reputation and adoption of a deceptively or confusingly similar design or shape by the defendant. (iv) The defenses, likewise, are entirely different, submitted counsel : whereas in design infringement suit, cancellation based on lack of novelty or existence of previous publication can be the basis of defenses, the lack of any distinctiveness (of the plaintiff's mark or design), prior user, bona fide use, or lack of plaintiff's goodwill are defenses in the passing off suit. (v) Lastly it was stated that although the court of competent jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Designs Act is identical to that in passing off, as soon as a defense of cancellation is claimed by the defendant in a design infringement suit, it has to be transferred to the High Court under Section 22(2) of the Designs Act.”",

A registered design owner, this court notices, facially satisfies the test of novelty (of the product's design) and that it was not previously published. For registration,the article must contain uniqueness or novelty in regard to elements such as  shape, configuration,pattern, ornament or composition of lines of colours applied to any article; further there must be a visual appeal to the article (i.e. the aesthetic appeal). However, if the defendant establishes that indeed there was no novelty, or that a similar design had been published earlier, in the public domain, the infringement claim would be repelled. In respect of a passing of claim, distinctiveness of the elements of the mark, its visual or other presentation and its association with the trader or owner needs to be established. The factual overlap here is with respect to the presentation -in the design, it is the novelty and aesthetic presentation;in a passing off action, it is the distinctiveness (of the mark) with the attendant association with the owner. To establish infringement (of a design) fraudulent imitation of the article (by the defendant) has to be proved. Likewise, to show passing off, it is necessary for the owner of the mark to establish that the defendant has misrepresented to the public (irrespective of intent) that its goods are that of the plaintiff's; the resultant harm to the plaintiff's reputation is an actionable claim.”",

                        "content": "In para 45 of the judgment, the FJB, rendering its opinion, held that the FB in Mohan Lal (supra), while correctly noting that registration as a design is not possible, of a trademark, however, later noted that post registration under Section 11 of the Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the design registrant for the reason that the use of a registered design as trademarkis not a ground of cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act, which was inaccurate. According to the FJB, this observation ignores the Designs Act, wherein Section 19(e) specifically exposes a registered design to cancellation, when it is not a design as defined under Section 2(d). It was held that if a registered design per se is used as a trademark, it apparently can be cancelled. What is, however, of significance for the present case, is the observation that the legal formulation  in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action, i.e., one which is not limited or restricted to trademarkuse alone, but the overall get-up or trade dress, however, is correct. Para 45 of the judgment is as under:- “45. This court is also of the opinion that the Full Bench ruling in Mohan Lal (supra) made an observation, which is inaccurate : it firstly correctly noted that registration as a design is not possible, of a trade mark; it, however later noted that “post registration under Section 11 of the Designs Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the registrant of the design. The reason being : the use of a registered design as a trade mark, is not provided as a ground for its cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.” This observation ignores that the Designs Act, Section 19(e) specifically exposes a registered design to cancellation when “(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.” The reason for this is that Section 2 of the Designs Act, defines “design” as “…the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article…….; but does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958…..” Therefore, if the registered design per se is used as a trade mark, it apparently can be cancelled. The larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action i.e one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or “trade dress” however, is correct; as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the product through its packaging and so on, given that a “passing off” claim can include but is also broader than infringement of a trademark, the cause of action against such use lies.”",

III considered by the FB in Mohan Lal (supra), constituted the subject matter of reference before the FJB in Carlsberg (supra), which was answeredby the FJB in the affirmative by holding that a composite suit that joins two causes of action, one for infringement of a registered design and the other for passing off is  maintainable. With regard to Issue numberII before the FB in Mohan Lal (supra), the Division Bench observed as under:- “22. Secondly, the sentence in para 43 of the judgment of Bhat, J. that “the larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or trade dress however, is correct” appears prima facie to place the issue beyond doubt that the FJB in Carlsberg upheld the view of the majority of the FB in Mohan Lal that a passing off action was indeed maintainable in respect of a registered design used as a trademark. To this Court is appears prima facie on a reading of the above para 43, together with the preceding and succeeding para, as a whole that the only qualification in Carlsberg was that if such registered design was used as a trademark then it can lead to the cancellation of the registration of such design. The words “as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the products through its packaging and so on” has to be seen in the context of the discussion preceding it which turns on what can be registered as a design and what cannot. Importantly,the FJB does not explicitly or impliedly overrule the FB in Mohan Lal as regards the answer to Issue II and rightly so since the FJB in Carlsberg was concerned only with Issue HI (whether a composite suit for design infringement and passing off was maintainable).",

The reasoning given by the FJB for this conclusion is simple. Definition of Design in Section 2(d) of the Act excludes any‘trademark’ as defined in Section 2(1)(v) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. However, going further, the FJB has clearly held that thelarger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra) that a passing off action i.e., one which is not limited or restrictedto trademark use alone, but the overall get-up, trade-dressetc., is correct. It was further held that as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get-up, presentation through its packaging etc. given that passing off claim can include and is also broader than infringement of a trademark, cause of action against such use lies. Seen in this light, learned Senior Counselfor DefendantNo.1 is not correct in arguing that a claim of passing off and infringement of a registered design cannot be raised simultaneously and thepleas are self-destructive. In fact, it would depend on the facts of each case whetherthere is ‘something extra’ in the product of the Plaintiff, which qualifies as a trademark and was not registered as a design as held in Dart Industries (supra) as also whether the claim of passing off is restricted to the trademark use alone or goes beyond to the overall get-up, trade dress etc. as held by the FJB in Carlsberg (supra).",

The Court then posed a question as to whether ‘something extra’ in the product of the Plaintiffs could qualify as a trademark and which was not registered as a design. Court examined the registered design andthe alleged claim for passing off and on the facts of the case, came to a conclusion that there was no difference between what was registered as a design and what was claimed as a trade dress and get-up qua which relief on the ground of passing off was sought. But the significant point is that the pleas of infringement of the registered design and passing off in “something extra” were examined in a composite suit as they are not self-destructive.

For people are likely to buy the article because of what it is, not in reliance on any belief of any particular trade origin.

According to Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading business or any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off will then lie wherever the defendant companys name, or its intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the proceedings.

Thetrim of  the ENTICER fan is a two-piece ornamentation with filleted corners with a minimalisticdesign, outlined with metallic dark tone border on its sides, while the impugned fan comprises of a marble pattern with golden intersecting lines on a grey smoky background.

Design, is not registrable inter alia if it is foundthat it has been disclosed to the publicby publication in tangible form or by use or in other way prior to the filing of the application for registration, as observed in several judgments. In other words, publication before registration defeats the proprietors right to protection. In this context, I may only refer to paras 20 and 24 from thejudgment of theCalcutta High Court in Atul Narsibhai  “20. The principle that emerges from the judicial decisions as well as from the authorities on the subject is that, in the event, it is found that the impugned design has substantial identity with the prior published design, it is liable to be cancelled. In order to claim novelty, there has to be a significant change or difference in the design, although, it may have a common source. A mere trade variant without significant and substantial noticeable features would destroy novelty. A drawing or publication of a design in any form must suggest explicitly or implicitly by context that the pattern or picture should be applied to an article.  xxx  xxx xxx 24. In Saunders v. Wiel reported in Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark, Vol. X, No. 4, Page 29, it was held that new or original design not previously published did not require novelty in the idea of the design but novelty in the application of the design to some article of manufacturer.

In order to create an aesthetic design, the creative team of the plaintiff company travels to different parts of the world to understand the various aspects of the theme, creates the mood board and then works on the design.

The law has been crystallized in a catena of judgments wherein the Courts have held that in relation designs, expression “original” includes designs which though old in themselves but were new in their application.  (a)  In Gammeter v. Controller of Patents and Designs (1918) ILR 45 Cal 606, the Court had held that the test that has to be applied to see whether a design is new or original or not is that the design must be new or original with reference to the kind of article to which it is applied. In the said case, the novelty band used by the plaintiff was held to be new and original even though the said band was similar to the bracelet produced by the defendants as the Court was of the view that the purpose and use of the band was entirely different from the purpose and use of the bracelet. It was further observed that the  said band had never been previously applied to wrist watches and the fact that it had an immediate and lucrative sale strongly indicates that the article sold was useful novelty. It was further observed that applying an old design to a new use must be protected. (Relevant paras 10, 11, 16 17).  (b)  In Gopal Glass Works v. Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs (2007) 1 Cal LT 290 (HC), the Court had observed that in order to destroy the novelty of a design registration whether by publication or use or any other way, must be of the pattern, shape and/or configuration applied to the same article. It was further observed that when the novelty of an article is tested against the prior published document, the main factor required to be judged is the visual effect and appeal of the picture illustration. Further, the Court held that such visual effect and appeal of the pattern and/or configuration must be considered in respect of the article to which it is applied. (Relevant paras 32 to 38 and 45 to 47).  (c)  In Bharat Glass Tube Limited v. Gopal Glass Works Limited AIR 2008 SC 2520, the Supreme Court had observed that the expression ‘new or original’ in the context of designs has to be construed that whether the said design has ever been produced by any third party on that particular article or not. It was held that in the registration of a design two things are required to be considered together i.e. the design and the design which is to be applied to an article. (Relevant Paras 6, 8, 10, 13, 14).  (d)  In Asian Rubber Industries v. Jasco Rubber 2013 (1) Bom CR 393, Paras 3, 13, 14, 15 & 19, the defendants had challenged the validity of the design of the plaintiff on the ground that the said design of the footwear registered by the plaintiff was not new or original as the said design was developed from ‘Padukas’ which design has been commonly available since centuries. In the said case, the Court was of the view that the plaintiff is not claiming to be the inventor of ‘Padukas’ and is not claiming exclusivity by way of a patent right. However, the plaintiff is claiming exclusivity in the ‘Creative Expression’ and the ‘Look and Feel’ of their  products. It was further observed that in the recent past, it is not known that the said look and feel of Padukas with the modification of strap to support the foot has been applied by any person to footwear. Thus, application of design of Padukas -of its ‘Look and Feel’, to footwear by the plaintiff in the recent past certainly falls within the meaning of ‘Original’ as defined in the Act and includes the cases which the old and themselves yet are new in their application (Relevant paras 3, 13, 14, 15, 19).  (e)  In Shiv Prasad Ram Dayal v. Shyamlal Bhagirath 1962 Cri LJ 551, the question that arose before the Court is that whether the general ‘get-up’ of the Katta of Bidis of the accused is a colorable imitation of the Katta of the complainant. The relevant portion of the said judgment is provided hereunder:  “In the instant case we have both the kattas of bidis before us and can decide for ourselves whether the general ‘get-up’ of the katta of the accused is a colourable imitation of the ‘Katta’ of the complainant. What is compendiously called the ‘get-up’, is the general size, shape and dress in which the goods are presented to the buyer. Size and shape are common to the trade as the Bidi kattas are usually packed in like size and shape. It is the dress the material, color and decoration of the wrapper, the motif of the trade mark label and its colour combination, the lettering and their arrangements which gives to the goods their individuality.  xxx  xxx  xxx",

At this stage, I am not delving into a comparison of the shape and configuration between the two fans as the same has been dealt with in detailin the earlier part of the judgment, for the reason that the shape and configuration of ENTICER ART-NS Stone is similar to theENTICER fans of the Plaintiff.",

In my view, the differences/dissimilarities that were attempted to be highlighted, are not sufficient to hold in favour of Defendant No.1 that therehas been noattempt to copy and misrepresent. It has been held in several judgments that if the Courts were to examine the dissimilarities with great minuteness, noPlaintiff would ever succeed in a claim for infringementor passing off as a clever Defendant, with some skill would always be in a position to make some cosmetic or minor changes and get away with deceit and/orinfringement.",

Theclaim to user in 2020, before the Plaintiff, albeit averred, was not argued and pressednor is there any material to establish the same, even prima facie. Additionally, if the intention of Defendant No.1 was not to misrepresent, the marble pattern could have been used in several other ways on the ceiling fans in terms of size, shape, placement, layout etc. The similarity in the impugned products, in my prima facie view, shows dishonest adoption of Plaintiff’s Design 2020 by Defendant No.1. The misrepresentation is with a view to deceive the public and encash on the goodwill and reputation, which inheres in the Plaintiff and which the Plaintiffhas prima facie established.",

                        "content": "The question of what tests are to be applied in deciding what constitutes an obvious imitation and/or is actionable is no longer res integra. This question has been considered in several judicial pronouncements. The leading decisions on the point are the decisions in the case of Castrol India Limited v. Tide Water Oil Co.(I) Limited and Kemp & Co. v. Prima Plastics Limited. In both the decisions, the Kolkata High Court and the Bombay High Court have laid down the following propositions as constituting the test to decide whether there is obvious imitation and/or piracy of a registered design.  (i)  The word ‘imitation’ does not mean ‘duplication’ in the sense that the copy complained of need not be an exact replica.  (ii)  The Court is required to see in particular as to whether the essential part or the basis of the Plaintiff's claim for novelty forms part of the infringing copy.  (iii)  The similarity or difference is to be judged through the eye alone and where the article in respect of which the design is applied is itself the object of purchase, through the eye of the purchaser.  (iv)  The Court must address its mind as to whether the design adopted by the Defendant was substantially different from the design which was registered. The Court ought to consider the rival designs as a whole to see whether the impugned design is substantially different from the design sought to be enforced. (The test laid down on Benchchairs Ltd. C. Chair Center Ltd. was cited with approval).  (v)  ‘Obvious’ means something which, as soon as one looks at it, strikes one as being so like the original design/the registered design, as to be almost unmistakable. Fraudulent  imitation is an imitation which is based upon, and deliberately based upon, the registered design and is an imitation which may be less apparent than obvious imitation, that is to say, one may have a more subtle distinction between the registered design and a fraudulent imitation and yet the fraudulent imitation, although it is different in some respects from the original, and in respects which render it not obviously an imitation may yet be an imitation perceptible when the two designs are closely scanned and accordingly amounts to infringement. (The test laid down in Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Golf Ball Developments Ltd. was cited with approval. Kemp & Co. v. Prima Plastics Limited: (supra)  (i)  If the visual features of shape, configuration pattern designs are similar or strikingly similar to the eye, it is not necessary that the two designs must be exactly identical and same. The matter must be looked at as one of substance and essential features of the designs ought to be considered.  (ii)  In a given case, where the registered design is made up of a pattern which has no one striking feature in it, but it appeals to the eye as a whole, it may very well be that another design may be an imitation of it which makes the same appeal to the eye notwithstanding that there are many differences in the details. (The opinion of Farwell J. in Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Golf Ball Developments Ltd. was cited with approval).  (iii)  In comparing rival designs the Court is required to see whether the impugned design/product is substantially different to the design which is sought to be enforced.",
