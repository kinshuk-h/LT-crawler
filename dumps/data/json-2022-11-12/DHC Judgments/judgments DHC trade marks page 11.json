[CS (OS) 3466/2012 decided on 20th February, 2014], which is clear to the effect that filing of ex parte evidence would not be required in all matters. Thus, this Court is of the opinion that no ex parte evidence needs to be adduced in this case. The same has been  reiterated by the Court in S. Oliver Bernd Freier GMBH & CO. KG v. Jaikara Apparels and Ors. [210 (2014) DLT 381], as also, in United Coffee House v. Raghav Kalra and Ors. [2013 (55) PTC 414 (Del)]. The relevant observations from the judgment in Disney Enterprises Inc. (supra), are as under:  “3. Though the defendants entered appearance through their counsel on 01.02.2013 but remained unrepresented thereafter and failed to file a written statement as well. The defendants were thus directed to be proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 04.10.2013and the plaintiffs permitted to file affidavits by way of ex parte evidence. 4. The plaintiffs, despite having been granted sufficient time and several opportunities, have failed to get their affidavits for leading ex-parte evidence on record. However, it is not deemed expedient to further await the same and allow this matter to languish, for the reason that I have in Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. Vs. Gauhati Town Club MANU/DE/0582/2013 held that where the defendant is ex parte and the material before the Court is sufficient to allow the claim of the plaintiff, the time of the Court should not be wasted in directing ex parte evidence to be recorded and which mostly is nothing but a repetition of the contents of the plaint.”",

The judgment relied by Ld. Counsel for defendant in Revajeetu Builders and Developers Vs. Naraina Swami and Sons & Ors. in Civil Appeal NO.6291/2009 pronounced on 09.10.2009 by the Apex Court, the judgment titled Colgate Palmolive Company & Ors. Vs. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. FAO (OS) 131/2012 decided on 19.07.2015 relied upon by Ld. Counsel for defendant are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case since the amendment sought to be made in the present case is the outcome of the written statement filed by the defendant and thus a subsequent event which could not have been known to the plaintiff as claimed, at the time of filing of the present case. The contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant that the plaintiff was aware of the said facts before the filing of the present suit is a matter of evidence.  The amendment sought to be made by the plaintiff is also necessary to decide the controversy in question completely and also to avoid the multiplicity of the litigation since admittedly the other group of companies of defendant are also dealing in the same goods under the impugned trademark SEMCO.  The plea with regard to the order dated 11.08.2020 does not come in the way of the present application since the written statement has been filed on 31.08.2020 i.e. after the clarification order was passed by Ld. Predecessor of this Court. It is also pertinent to mention here that the amendment proposed to be made does not at all change the nature of the suit. The matter is at the initial stage since the trial has yet not commenced. Hence, no prejudice shall be caused to defendant no.1 if the application for amendment is allowed.  In view of the above discussion, application under Order VI Rule 17 read with Order 1 Rule 10 and read with 151 CPC moved by plaintiff is allowed.”",

This seizure of products other than sanitizers was challenged by Defendant No.1 as being contrary to the clarification dated 11th August, 2020. Accordingly, the Commercial Court vide order dated 23rd September, 2020 directed release of masks seized, while holding that the release of the disinfectant sprays and hypochlorite solution seized would have to be decided along with the injunction application. In the meantime, Defendant No.1 had filed its written statement before the Commercial Court which stated that it was dealing in different goods and had different group entities. Accordingly, the Plaintiff moved an application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC read with Order I Rule 10 CPC, seeking to incorporate the various goods produced by the Defendants, to the list of impugned products as also to implead other group  entities of the Defendants, which was allowed by the Commercial Court vide the impugned order dated 10th January 2022. The Commercial Court allowed the applications, permitting the addition of the group companies of the Defendants to the suit pending between the parties, as also the addition of some impugned products. The relevant extracts of the impugned order are as under:  “ At the outset, there is no dispute that the amendment sought to be made is the outcome of the averments made by the defendant in the written statement and the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. Though it is averred that the plaintiff was very much aware about defendant no.1 and its group of companies from the very beginning, however, in view of the judgment in Lakha Ram Sharma's case (Supra), the question whether or not the claim made in the application is bonafide or not is to be decided at the trial of the suit.  The judgment relied by Ld. Counsel for defendant in Revajeetu Builders and Developers Vs. Naraina Swami and Sons & Ors. in Civil Appeal NO.6291/2009 pronounced on 09.10.2009 by the Apex Court, the judgment titled Colgate Palmolive Company & Ors. Vs. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. FAO (OS) 131/2012 decided on 19.07.2015 relied upon by Ld. Counsel for defendant are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case since the amendment sought to be made in the present case is the outcome of the written statement filed by the defendant and thus a subsequent event which could not have been known to the plaintiff as claimed, at the time of filing of the present case. The contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant that the plaintiff was aware of the said facts before the filing of the present suit is a matter of evidence.  The amendment sought to be made by the plaintiff is also necessary to decide the controversy in question completely and also to avoid the multiplicity of the litigation since admittedly the other group of companies of defendant are also dealing in the same goods under the impugned trademark SEMCO.  The plea with regard to the order dated 11.08.2020 does not come in the way of the present application since the written statement has been filed on 31.08.2020 i.e. after the clarification order was passed by Ld. Predecessor of this Court. It is also pertinent to mention here that the amendment proposed to be made does not at all change the nature of the suit. The matter is at the initial stage since the trial has yet not commenced. Hence, no prejudice shall be caused to defendant no.1 if the application for amendment is allowed.  In view of the above discussion, application under Order VI Rule 17 read with Order 1 Rule 10 and read with 151 CPC moved by plaintiff is allowed.”",

This seizure of products other than sanitizers was challenged by Defendant No.1 as being contrary to the clarification dated 11th August, 2020. Accordingly, the Commercial Court vide order dated 23rd September, 2020 directed release of masks seized, while holding that the release of the disinfectant sprays and hypochlorite solution seized would have to be decided along with the injunction application. In the meantime, Defendant No.1 had filed its written statement before the Commercial Court which stated that it was dealing in different goods and had different group entities. Accordingly, the Plaintiff moved an application under Order VI Rule 17 CPC read with Order I Rule 10 CPC, seeking to incorporate the various goods produced by the Defendants, to the list of impugned products as also to implead other group  entities of the Defendants, which was allowed by the Commercial Court vide the impugned order dated 10th January 2022. The Commercial Court allowed the applications, permitting the addition of the group companies of the Defendants to the suit pending between the parties, as also the addition of some impugned products. The relevant extracts of the impugned order are as under:  “ At the outset, there is no dispute that the amendment sought to be made is the outcome of the averments made by the defendant in the written statement and the application under Order 39 Rule 4 CPC. Though it is averred that the plaintiff was very much aware about defendant no.1 and its group of companies from the very beginning, however, in view of the judgment in Lakha Ram Sharma's case (Supra), the question whether or not the claim made in the application is bonafide or not is to be decided at the trial of the suit.  The judgment relied by Ld. Counsel for defendant in Revajeetu Builders and Developers Vs. Naraina Swami and Sons & Ors. in Civil Appeal NO.6291/2009 pronounced on 09.10.2009 by the Apex Court, the judgment titled Colgate Palmolive Company & Ors. Vs. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd. FAO (OS) 131/2012 decided on 19.07.2015 relied upon by Ld. Counsel for defendant are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case since the amendment sought to be made in the present case is the outcome of the written statement filed by the defendant and thus a subsequent event which could not have been known to the plaintiff as claimed, at the time of filing of the present case. The contention of Ld. Counsel for defendant that the plaintiff was aware of the said facts before the filing of the present suit is a matter of evidence.  The amendment sought to be made by the plaintiff is also necessary to decide the controversy in question completely and also to avoid the multiplicity of the litigation since admittedly the other group of companies of defendant are also dealing in the same goods under the impugned trademark SEMCO.  The plea with regard to the order dated 11.08.2020 does not come in the way of the present application since the written statement has been filed on 31.08.2020 i.e. after the clarification order was passed by Ld. Predecessor of this Court. It is also pertinent to mention here that the amendment proposed to be made does not at all change the nature of the suit. The matter is at the initial stage since the trial has yet not commenced. Hence, no prejudice shall be caused to defendant no.1 if the application for amendment is allowed.  In view of the above discussion, application under Order VI Rule 17 read with Order 1 Rule 10 and read with 151 CPC moved by plaintiff is allowed.”",

On 01.03.2011, ‘Rule’ was issued and the petition was admitted to hearing. The writ petition has remained pendingsince then and at this distant point of time, when a long period of almost 14 years has lapsed, in my view, it would be inequitable to dismiss the writ petition on the groundof lack of territorial jurisdiction.

I am also persuaded by a judgment of the High Court of Punjaband Haryana in Inder Pal Singh v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors., in Crl. Writ Petition 465/1997 decided on 17.01.2003, wherein a preliminary objection was raised before the Division  Bench that the Court had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the petition and the Petitioner had argued that when the matter was listed for final hearing, this preliminary objection could not be raised also because the  petition was admitted for regular hearing way back in the year 1996. Reliance was placed on a judgment of the Supreme Court in Dinesh Chandra Gahtori vs. Chief of Army Staff and Anr. (2001) 9 SCC 525 in this regard. Agreeing with thecontention of the Petitioner, the Division Bench held that it would not be appropriate to dismiss the writ petition at that stage in theyear 2003, on the point of territorial jurisdiction, since the matter hadremained pending for a long time.",

Going into the chronology of dates and events, it is undisputed that the impugned advertisement was published in the Mega Journal on 25.08.2003 and the trademark of Respondent No.3 was registered on 16.04.2005. As per the counter affidavit filed by Respondents No.1 and 2, the mark was renewed on 29.01.2007 for ten years, which is undisputed by thePetitioner. Petitioner hasaverred in the petition that he learnt of the registration of the mark in 2006, when the Registration Certificate was filed by Respondent No.3 along with an application for amendment in a suit pending in the District Courts, between the same parties. The application is on record and is supported by an affidavit dated 15.09.2006. The aforesaid narrative is only with a view to bring forth the fact that when the present petition was filed in theyear 2008, Petitioner was aware that the trademarkof RespondentNo.3 was registered in 2005. At this stage, the statutory remedy available to the Petitioner was to seek cancellation of the registered trademark and rectification of the Register under Section 57 of the Act. It needs to be highlighted here that Petitioner was also aware of the power of Registrar of Trade Marks, to rectify the register under Section 57 of the Act, which is reflected from the letters addressed by the Petitioner to the Registrar in the years 2006 and 2007, followed by a legal notice, wherein a request was made to takeaction under Section 57(4) of the Act. However, the Petitioner failed to take recourse to the appropriateremedyavailable to him under theStatuteand instead filed the present writ petition, for the reasonsbest known to him.",

Petitioner had filed an opposition to the registration of the trademark ‘CHAAPAT’ applied for by the Respondent on the ground that it was  identical to the trademark ‘CHAAPAT’. Subsequent to the filing of the application, Petitioner discovered that publication of the advertisement in the Journal was not proper as besides the said word, ‘CHAAPAT’, there were some other words which were not clearly visible. The application for amendment of the opposition was rejected. It is in this context that the Petitioner had assailedthe impugned order and the Court finding t hat the word ‘PRIKAS’ appearing in the advertisement was not properly visible and allowed the writ petition allowing the Petitioner to incorporateamendments in the opposition.",

It is undisputed that till date, the Petitioner has taken no steps to challenge the registration of the trademark granted in favour of Respondent No.3 in accordance with the remedies available underthe Act. Chapter-III of the Act provides the procedure for applying for registration of a trademark. Section 18 details the procedure for makingan application as well as prescribes the power of the Registrar of Trade Marks to refuse the application or accept it absolutely or subject to such amendments, modifications, conditions etc., if any, as he may think fit .  In case of refusal or conditional acceptance, the grou nds for doing so are required to be recorded in writing. Section 19 provides for withdrawal of acceptance for thereasons statedin Section 19 (a) & (b) but the withdrawal can only be before the registration of the mark. Section 20 provides for advertisement of an application, either after acceptance or before acceptance, so as to afford an opportunity to the public, to oppose the registration of the mark. Section 21 enables any person to apply for opposition to the registration, within four months from the date of advertisement or re-advertisement of the application for registration. Once the application is accepted and either not opposed or if opposed, the opposition has been rejected, the Registrar regist ers the trademark u nder Section 23 of the Act.",

Having perused the Schemeof the Act, in my view, what is discernible is that post-registration of a trademark the remedy available to any person aggrieved is to seek cancellation of the mark and rectification of the Register, under Section 57 in Chapter VII of the Act. It is evident that Petitioner was completely aware of the said remedy way-back in the year 2006, but choseto remain silent and took no steps to seek cancellation of the mark and rectification of the Register, with respect to the trademark in question. Examined from this angle, in view of the statutory remedy available underthe Act, the relief sought in the present petition cannot be granted. Entertaining the petition at this stage and quashing the advertisement, assuming the same is illegible, wouldamount to entertaining  the petition against the settled principles of law th at the High Court will ordinarily not exercisethe extraordinary writ jurisdiction if th ere exists an alternative remedy, moreparticularly, a statutory remedy. Additionally, this would amount to rendering the statutoryremedyredundant and otiose.

Petitioner admittedly took no steps to challenge the registration of thetrademark between 2005 to 2008 or at least from 2006, when according to the Petitioner, he learnt of the registration. The only explanation rendered is that the Petitioner was writing letters to the Registrar, followed by a legal notice, for redressal of his grievance. It is a settled principleof law that in a writ jurisdiction, which is an extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court, Court would not ordinarily assist those who are lethargic and indolent. If there is a delay on the part of the Petitioner, which is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may decline to exercise the writ jurisdiction. Thisprinciple applies with a greater rigour, when the Petitioner on account of its lethargy permits t ime to lapse and in the meantime, third party rights are created. It is equally well-settled that mere writing of letters or representations cannot fu rnish an adequate explanation for delay. This principle was settled way-back in KV Rajalakshmiah Setty v. State of Mysore, AIR 1967 SC 993, and was reiterated in Rabindranath Bose and Others v. Union of India and Others, AIR 1970 SC 470. The judgments, in my view, squarely apply to the  present case, where thePetitioner took no action, except to correspond with the Registrar and admittedly in the meantime, statutory rights have accrued in favour of Respondent No.3.

Affidavits have also been filed by some of these  officials, explaining the reasons why the Court was not informed that more than 7000 oppositions were filed and taken on record, beyond the period of limitation. While reading the affidavits, the impression that the Court gets is that there has been a clear lack of communication between the various officers in the CGPDTM and conflicting notices were issued in respect of acceptance of oppositions. It is also submitted by the officers that they were not in the CGPDTM in the capacity of hearing officers and were therefore unaware of any oppositions being accepted beyond the limitation period.
