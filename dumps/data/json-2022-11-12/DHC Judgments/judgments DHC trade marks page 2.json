Therefore, registration of a mark does not bar initiation of a passing off action by the aggrieved party. Further, Section 34 of the Act stipulates that nothing shall entitle a registered proprietor to interfere with the rights of a prior user. This principle has also been expounded by the Supreme Court.7 In S. Syed Mohideen (supra) the Court examined the contours of above-noted Sections 27, 28 and 34, and also approved the reasoning in N.R. Dongre (supra). The relevant portion of the said judgment is extracted below:  •30.1. From the reading of Section 27(2) of the Act, it is clear that the right of action of any person for passing off the goods/services of another person and remedies thereof are not affected by the provisions of the Act.

Conjoint reading of Sections 34, 27 and 28 would show that the rights of registration are subject to Section 34 which can be seen from the opening words of Section 28 of the Act which states •Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the registration of a trade mark shall, if valid, give to the registered proprietor....• and also the opening words of Section 34 which states •Nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of registered trade mark to interfere...• Thus, the scheme of the Act is such where rights of prior user are recognised superior than that of the registration and even the registered proprietor cannot disturb/interfere with the rights of prior user. The overall effect of collective reading of the provisions of the Act is that the action for passing off which is premised on the rights of prior user generating a goodwill shall be unaffected by any registration provided under the Act. This proposition has been discussed in extenso in N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn. [N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corpn., 1995 SCC OnLine Del 310 : AIR 1995 Del 300] wherein the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court recognised that the registration is not an indefeasible right and the same is subject to rights of prior user.

However, if the objection of invalidity is raised by the opposing party, a subsisting trademark registration does not preclude the Court from forming a prima facie view on the objection, even at the interlocutory stage. In this regard, it would be pertinent to note that Division Bench of this Court in Marico Limited v. Agro Food Limited, 8 while examining the interplay between Sections 28, 31 and 124 of the Act, held that it would be permissible for Courts to prima facie examine validity of registration for the purposes of deciding interlocutory applications.

The invoice issued in favour of WIT Buildtech Pvt. Ltd, on the face of it, mentions the sale of •GeoCrete ST/ InfraCrete ST• products; however, claim of sale of •GeoCrete• products is uncorroborated. To refute the invoice, TIMAB drew attention of the Court to Agreements dated 8th February, 2011 and Supplementary Agreement dated 18th October, 2012 entered into between WIT Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. and CCL International Ltd. (contractual partner of Shamrock Geoscience Pvt. Ltd.) that pertain to sale of •InfraCrete and German Technology•.11 Upon a closer scrutiny of said agreements, it transpires that WIT Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. was engaged in import, marketing, selling and manufacturing of •InfraCrete• products, and not •GeoCrete• products. That apart, TIMAB also raised certain objections qua the use •InfraCrete• mark by SHAMROCK. It was submitted that use of •InfraCrete• mark is questionable considering the letter issued by one InfraCrete GmbH to CCL International Ltd. in 2013, stating that till date, no InfraCrete products have been supplied by it in India. It has further been pointed out that it was only after the afore-said communication that Mr. Korytowski adopted and commenced usage of the •EvoCrete• mark. These objections find favour with the Court, and therefore, the invoice referred above cannot be considered as a proof of prior use.",

The German Appellate Court vide order dated 16th October, 2009 in an appeal by SHAMROCK (Defendants therein), made following observations (as per translated copy) qua the Supply Contract and Supply License Agreement:  •The defendants cannot rely on the conclusion of the •delivery contract for soil solidification additives• concluded between the applicant and the defendant for 1st and 2nd /18.7.2007 (Appendix Ast 5) the use of the trademark •GeoCrete• is permitted and therefore does not use the domain names in question within the meaning of Art. 9 para. 1 sentence 2 of GMV would use •without consent•. Although it is true that, according to S 3 of the contract, the applicant is obliged to manufacture, deliver to the products •GeoCrete ST• and •GeoCrete IM• for the defendants to 1st and 2nd and to label the products in accordance with S 9 with the trademark •GeoCrete,• the applicant owns in accordance with Contract only the distribution rights for the countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as well as Equatorial Guinea, otherwise distribution will take place via the defendant to 2. It can be deduced from this by interpretation (SS 133, 157 BGB) that the defendants should be entitled to distribute the contract products produced and delivered by the applicant under the trademark •GeoCrete! To market. In fact, however, the defendants no longer have the products manufactured by the applicant due to disputes since 2008.  xx  • xx  • xx  For the same reason, the defendants cannot rely on the supply agreement between the applicant and the defendant for the 2nd delivery agreement concluded on August 12, 2005 (Appendix VB 9). Even under this contract, the defendant should be solely obliged and entitled to use the name •GeoCrete• when selling her products manufactured using the special binders manufactured by the applicant. Such products are no longer undisputedly distributed by the applicants. In this context, therefore, it is not necessary to decide whether the contract of 12.8.2005 with a view to the subsequent agreement of July 18, 2007 (Appendix Ast 5) still exists at all.•  [Emphasis Supplied]",

A prima facie analysis of the documents relied upon depicts that SHAMROCK•s claims of use/prior use of the impugned mark in India is not supported by any credible material; SHAMROCK has failed to prove the adoption and use of the •proposed to be used• mark in India. Neither has there been actual sale of goods to which the impugned mark is applied, nor any proof of non-sales activities such as promotion/ advertisement of the impugned mark has been shown. The documents referred above demonstrate that the limited use of the impugned mark by SHAMROCK was consequent to express authorisation or licensing by TIMAB, and not vice versa. SHAMROCK had no independent right to use the impugned mark which belongs to TIMAB. Mere registration of a mark by the Trade Mark Registry does not prove its use by the proprietor in whose name the said mark was registered. Due to lack of documentary proof and inability of SHAMROCK to sustain its claim of use in India, its registration of the impugned mark and the rights flowing therefrom become subservient to superior rights of prior user i.e., TIMAB, which are discussed in later segments of this judgement. The Court is unable to agree that SHAMROCK has been sufficiently using the impugned mark in India entitling it to seek an injunction against TIMAB.

Further, Mr. Chandra had also emphasised that the Courts in Germany have not taken into consideration or have not interpreted the agreements that existed between Van Mannekus and/ or GCBV and Mr. Korytowski and his companies. He further attempted to  highlight that the Courts in Germany refrained from taking into consideration the registration of the impugned mark in Switzerland and Africa in the name of GCC, as the same was not deemed to be relevant for the purpose of said proceedings. In the opinion of the Court, Mr. Chandra•s contention is incorrect. The orders of the Courts in Germany cannot be brushed aside lightly. The Courts in Germany have examined and interpreted the contracts, contrary to Mr. Chandra•s assertion. At this interim stage, the view taken by the Courts in Germany relating to the impugned mark on the basis of contractual rights arising from agreements, which were also cited before this Court, is therefore certainly persuasive. It is not disputed by SHAMROCK that it does not have any manufacturing facility in India and the goods are being imported from Germany, where presently, in terms of order passed by Courts in Germany, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark. On a pointed query of the Court, Mr. Chandra conceded that, at the place of origin of the goods, SHAMROCK cannot use the impugned mark on the goods. Thus, the use of the impugned mark by SHAMROCK, if at all, is being done after import of goods in India.  16 As recorded in order dated 24th February, 2009 of the Hamburg Regional Court.",

                        "content": "Contentions raised on behalf of the Plaintiff can be summarised as follows:  a)  The impugned trademarks NUAPPLEPLANT / , are identical/deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s trademark APPLESTREE and Defendant has also slavishly copied the packaging/get-up/trade dress. The rival products are identical i.e. Abrasive Papers, Abrasive Sand, Abrasive Rolls, Abrasive Paper/Paste etc. and the trade channels being identical and the class of consumers being same, there is every likelihood that consumers will be confused into believing that the products of the Defendant emanate from the Plaintiff, amounting to passing off and violation of Plaintiff’s common law rights.  b)  The trademark NUAPPLEPLANT is phonetically, visually and structurally similar to Plaintiff’s trademark APPLESTREE (word per se) and all the essential and distinguishing features of the label mark have been slavishly copied by the Defendant. The word ‘PLANT’ conveys the same meaning as ‘TREE’ and thus, there is an idea similarity between the two trademarks, which will create an impression that the two trademarks are connected and associated.  c)  Defendant has lifted the entire artwork, layout, get-up, colour scheme, pattern and individual features in toto from Plaintiff’s prior adopted and launched packaging of APPLESTREE. Being in the trade of identical products, Defendant was fully aware of Plaintiff’s prior use of the trademark and sale of the products under it and, therefore, adoption of similar trademark, get-up etc. is a fraudulent and dishonest adoption. It is obvious that Defendant wants to encash on the enormous reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff, for illegal gains.  d)  General public, traders and consumers who are well aware of the reputation of the Plaintiff and the quality of the goods sold under the trademark APPLESTREE would continue to buy the products of the Defendant under the assumption that they emanate from the Plaintiff and in case any defect is found in the impugned products, it would lead to loss of reputation and goodwill of the Plaintiff, which is a very important asset. Use of the trademark NUAPPLEPLANT by the Defendant will lead to dilution of Plaintiff’s trademark APPLESTREE and will blur the association  between the competing products. Defendant’s acts are contrary to honest practices in the commercial domain and the misrepresentation is deliberate and calculated to cause injury and irreparable loss to the Plaintiff.  e)  The packaging of the Plaintiff’s products is an ‘artistic work’ under the Copyright Act, 1957, having been created/authored by late husband of the Plaintiff in the year 2008. Plaintiff is thus entitled to protection and any unauthorized use is infringement under Section 51 of the said Act.  f)  Learned counsel for the Plaintiff relied on the following judgments:  I.  Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s Allied Blender & Distillers Pvt. Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 10164 and Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., AIR 1960 SC 142, for the proposition that two marks are deceptively similar if they convey the same meaning or idea i.e. semantic similarity.  II.  Corn Products Refining Co. (supra): Mere presence of trademark on the trademark register does not prove user or that the mark is common to trade.  III.  Anil Verma v. R.K. Jewellers SK Group and Others, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8252: Defendant is estopped from arguing that Plaintiff’s marks are descriptive/generic as Defendant has himself applied for registration of the trademark NUAPPLEPLANT.  IV.  Pankaj Goel v. Dabur India Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 1744, to argue that in the absence of any material on record to show that any third party is using the mark for its product, it cannot be urged by the Defendant that the mark ‘Apple’ is common to trade.  V.  Century Traders v. Roshan Lal Duggar & Co., 1977 SCC OnLine Del 50: In a passing off action, Court has to only consider who is the prior user.  VI.  M/s. Hindustan Pencils Private Limited v. M/s. India Stationary Products Co. & Another, 1989 SCC OnLine Del 34: Injunction should be granted against Defendant in public interest, particularly, when adoption by the Defendant is dishonest.  VII.  Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhai Shah and Another, (2002) 3 SCC 65: Plaintiff does not have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing off and likelihood of damage is sufficient.  VIII. Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. and Another v. Sudhir Bhatia and Others, (2004) 3 SCC 90: Grant of injunction becomes necessary if it prima facie appears to the Court that adoption of the trademark was itself dishonest.",

                        "content": "Per contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant raised the following defences:  a)  Plaintiff is not entitled to equitable relief of injunction as material facts have been concealed from this Court. It is claimed in the plaint that Plaintiff is using the trademark APPLESTREE since  the year 2008, which is false and also contrary to the record in the Trade Marks Registry. Some of the invoices placed on record indicate that user of the trademark commenced only in the year 2018, since the first invoice on record is dated 09.03.2018.  b)  There is concealment of fact that Plaintiff has filed several trademark applications for registrations of various formatives of the trademark APPLESTREE, i.e. device mark/with suffix or prefix, in which user has been claimed from 2017, which itself evidences that the user of the trademark APPLESTREE by the Plaintiff or her predecessor cannot be prior to the said year. Although in the trademark application bearing No. 3463220, Plaintiff has claimed user since 15.02.2008, it is not understood why the application has been filed only on 21.01.2017. Two trademark applications filed by the Plaintiff in the year 2021, bearing Nos. 5216185 and 5216186 for registration of the trademark APPLESTREE (device mark) as well as three other applications bearing Nos. 5216187, 5216188 and 5216189 for the trademark ‘APPLES ABRASIVE PAPER’, all for registrations in Class 03 reflect that Plaintiff started using the trademark either in the year 2017 or 2018 albeit invoices filed by the Plaintiff show that prior to the year 2018, the trademark did not exist. As per the records available on the trademarks website, the Registrar of Trade Marks while issuing the examination report in four of the aforesaid applications filed by the Plaintiff, cited similar trademarks used by other persons/entities and significantly in the reply, Plaintiff has taken a stand that the cited marks, i.e., APPLE  (Device), APPLE (Label), APPLE WASH, APPLE DETERGENT CAKE and APPLE UNISEX SALON, are not similar to Plaintiff’s trademark. Present suit is filed under the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 and is required to be accompanied by statement of truth, wherein the party is under a mandate to truthfully disclose all facts and documents in its power, possession, control or custody. Hence, the present suit, wherein false averments are made in the plaint, deserves to be dismissed on this ground alone.  c)  Defendant bonafidely adopted the trademarks NUAPPLEPLANT/  (device mark) and started using the same from the year 2019, which was within the knowledge of the Plaintiff. User by the Defendant has been open and without any hindrance/ objection from the public, including the Plaintiff/her predecessor, who have acquienced in its use. In any event, the trademarks (word/label) are distinct, both visually and phonetically and it cannot be contended that they are identical/similar. There is no similarity in the packaging, trade dress and/or layout, as alleged by the Plaintiff and there can be no likelihood or possibility of any confusion or deception amongst the consumers and members of the trade. The fact that the rival  trademarks are dissimilar is evident from their pronunciation, pictorial representation, overall packaging and trade dress.  d)  In any case, no monopoly/exclusivity can be claimed by the Plaintiff in the trademark APPLESTREE as the mark ‘APPLE’ is generic in nature and cannot be termed as distinctive so as to identify the products sold under it as originating from the Plaintiff’s house. Marks which are generic, descriptive or suggestive have lower degree of legal protection as compared to marks which are arbitrary or fanciful. It is settled law that a person/entity who adopts a mark, which is a generic/descriptive, runs the risk of vulnerability of the mark. ‘APPLE’ is clearly a generic word and there are several persons/entities who use the word APPLE by itself or along with suffix/prefix and have been so using prior to the Plaintiff.  e)  Defendant is not new to the business in sale of products relating to Abrasive Papers etc. in class 03. In the year 1963, predecessors of the Defendant, namely, Mr. Jai Chand Arora and Mr. Om Prakash Arora started the business of marketing and selling abrasive strips, paper, rolls etc. in the name of M/s Kwality Paints and Hardware Store. In 1980, the partnership firm was dissolved and subsequently, father of the Defendant entered in the business and started his firm in the name and style M/s. Kwality Paints Industries. In the subsequent years, new firms were started after dissolving the earlier ones. In 2015, Defendant and his mother incorporated a company, which started the business of marketing and selling abrasive paper etc. and in 2019, in order to expand his  business, Mr. Amit Arora conceived and adopted the trademark/ device NUAPPLEPLANT and applied for registration of the mark on 07.02.2019 in class 03, with respect to the said goods on a ‘proposed to be used basis’. The trademark has been registered in favour of the Defendant with no opposition by any party. On 04.08.2021, Defendant has filed another application for registration of the device/mark NUAPPLEPLANT, claiming user since 07.02.2019, which is opposed by the Plaintiff. Defendant is a bona fide user of the trademarks and has no intent to copy the trademarks or the packaging of the Plaintiff and least of all to encash on Plaintiff’s goodwill/reputation.  f)  There are several judicial precedents which hold that the trademark has to be compared as a whole and should not be dissected into individual components, while considering the question of identity or deceptive similarity and this is the position adopted by the Plaintiff herself in the reply filed in response to the examination report and thus, cannot be permitted to change her stand before this Court.  g)  Learned counsel for the Defendant relied on the following judgments:  I.  Cadila Health Care Ltd. v. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (2001) 5 SCC 73.  II.  Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980.  III.  S.M. Dyechem Ltd. v. Cadbury (India) Ltd., (2000) 5 SCC 573.  IV.  Kishore Samrite v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others, (2013) 2 SCC 398.  V.  Amritdhara Pharmacy v. Satya Deo Gupta, AIR 1963 SC 449.",

                        "content": "Responding to the contentions raised by the Defendant, learned counsel for the Plaintiff in rejoinder contended as follows:  a)  Defendant has admitted that Plaintiff is the prior user of the trademark and packaging, at least from the year 2017 and since the admitted user of the Defendant is from the year 2019, the suit deserves to be decreed in view of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’) and Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment in view of Order XIII-A CPC, as amended by the Commercial Courts Act, 2015. Moreover, this is a suit for passing off and not for infringement of trademark and once the Defendant admits that Plaintiff is the prior user, a decree ought to be passed under Order XII Rule 6 of CPC.  b)  Defendant having sought registration of the impugned trademark NUAPPLEPLANT, is estopped from contending that Plaintiff’s mark is generic.  c)  Contention of the Defendant that Plaintiff has made an attempt to misguide the Court by predicating the case on user from 2008, is wholly misconceived. In the pending trademark applications bearing Nos. 5216185, 5216186, 5216187, 5216188 and 5216189, Plaintiff has filed affidavits in support of the use of the trademark since 2008 and has also given sales figures to evidence the user, which is consistent with the averments in the plaint and significantly, the affidavits are prior to filing of the present suit.  No doubt, in the applications as well as in reply to the examination report, Plaintiff has inadvertently claimed user from 2017, but this is only a typographical error and Plaintiff has already taken steps to cure the same and documents in that regard have been filed before this Court also. Defendant has mischievously filed only selected documents without disclosing the complete facts.  d)  In Anil Verma (supra) and The Financial Times Ltd. v. The Times Publishing House Ltd., 2016 SCC OnLine Del 5510, the Courts have held that in infringement and passing off cases, it is only the Court which has to decide whether two marks of the parties are deceptively similar or not and therefore, any stand taken by the Plaintiff before the Trade Marks Registry that the mark has to be seen as a whole, is irrelevant. In any case, there cannot be any debate on the proposition of law that a trademark has to be seen as a whole but it is equally settled that the Court can while examining similarity in rival marks look into the dominant/ essential part of the trademark.",

In the replication, however, a categorical stand is taken that the present suit is for passing off and not for infringement of the trademarks and apparently, the change in the stand of the Plaintiff, is in the wake of the Defendant being a registered proprietor of the trademark  NUAPPLEPLANT. Even during the course of arguments, it was canvassed by learned counsel for the Plaintiff that the argument was restricted to infringement of copyright and passing off. In this view of the matter, this Court need not detain itself with the aspect of infringement of the trademark  APPLESTREE.",

Plain reading of Section 28(3) of the Act shows that between two persons who are registered owners of the trademarks there is no exclusive right to use the trademark against each other, i.e. both have concurrent right to use the registered trademark in their favour. It is a matter of commonsense that Plaintiff cannot say that its registered trademark is infringed when the Defendant is also enjoying registration in the trademark with respect to their respective goods for which they are registered. This law is clearly well-settled and reference is made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in S. Syed Mohideen v. P. Sulochana Bai, (2016) 2 SCC 683 and of this Court in Rana Steels v. Ran India Steels Pvt. Ltd., 2008 SCC OnLine Del 399. Thus, the Plaintiff has rightly canvassed that the suit is for passing off and not infringement of the trademark.",

                        "content": "The question that arises is whether Plaintiff can make a claim of passing off against the Defendant in view of the latter being a registered proprietor of the impugned trademark. This position of law is no longer res integra. The Supreme Court in S. Syed Mohideen (supra), while deciding  the interplay of Section 27(2) and Section 28(3) of the Act has held that the answer to the question would be in the affirmative. The reasons postulated by the Supreme Court while coming to the said conclusion can be summed up as: (a) conjoint reading of Sections 27, 28, 29 and 34 of the Act would show that rights conferred by registration are subject to rights of the prior user of the trademark; (b) right of action of any person for passing off the goods/services of another person and remedies thereof are not affected by the provisions of the Act, since rights of passing off emanate from common law and are not statutory; (c) rights of registration are subject to Section 34, which is evident from the opening words of Section 28 and Scheme of the Act is such where rights of prior user are recognised as superior than those of a registered proprietor, as an action for passing off is premised on the rights of a prior user generating a goodwill; (d) passing off is a common law right for protection of goodwill in business against misrepresentation, caused in the course of trade and is an action in deceit, predicated on the general principle that no person is entitled to represent his or her business as business of another person; and (e) registration is no defence to passing off action and the rights conferred under Section 28 are subject to provisions of Section 27(2), since registration merely recognises the rights which are already pre-existing in common law and do not create any rights. Therefore, registration of the trademark of the Defendant is irrelevant in an action for passing off. In the light of this binding dictum of the Supreme Court, in my view, Plaintiff is entitled to file a suit alleging passing off against the Defendant independent of and de hors the fact that Defendant is a registered proprietor of the impugned mark NUAPPLEPLANT.",

In N.R. Dongre & Others v. Whirlpool Corporation and Another, (1995) SCC OnLine Del 310, one of the questions before the Division Bench of this Court was whether the Respondent therein, who had brought an action for injunction against the Appellants, on the ground of passing off, could maintain such an action against the Appellants, who were also registered proprietors of the trademark ‘WHIRLPOOL’ in India. The Division Bench of this Court, relying on the judgment of another Division Bench of this Court in Century Traders (supra), answered the question in the affirmative. Construing Sections 27(2) and 106 of the Act, the Court in Century Traders (supra), emphasised on the requirement of establishing ‘prior user’ and relevant para is as follows:  “14. Thus, the law is pretty well-settled that in order to succeed at this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is irrelevant in an action passing off and the mere presence of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the registered trade marks. In our opinion, these clear rules of law were not kept in view by the learned Single Judge and led him to commit an error.”",

The Court, however, overruled the contention and observed that the judgment in Century Traders (supra) held the field and there was no judgment of a Division Bench or a larger Bench of this Court taking a contra view. It was held that no one can be permitted to trade by deceiving or misleading the purchasers or to unauthorizedly divert to itself the reputation and goodwill of others. Under Section 27(2), an action for passing off against registered user of a trademark is maintainable at the instance of a ‘prior user’ of a trademark, which is identical or deceptively similar thereto.

Relevant would it be in this regard to refer to the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Consolidated Foods Corporation v. Brandon & Co. Private Limited, 1961 SCC OnLine Bom 55, wherein it was observed as under:  “50. ........ To summarise, therefore, a trader acquires a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with his goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade. The trader who adopts such a mark is entitled to protection directly the article having assumed a vendible character is launched upon the market. As between two competitors who are each desirous of adopting such a mark, “it is, to use familiar language, entirely a question of who  gets there first.” (Gaw Kan Lye v. Saw Kyone Saing [[1939] A.I.R. Ran. 343, F.B.]). Registration under the statute does not confer any new right to the mark claimed or any greater rights than what already existed at common law and at equity without registration. It does, however, facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout the State and it establishes the record of facts affecting the right to the mark. Registration itself does not create a trade mark. The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute. Common law rights are left wholly unaffected. Priority in adoption and use of a trade mark is superior to priority in registration.”",

This cannot be considered satisfactory evidence at this stage of user since 2008. Learned counsel for the Defendant is right in pointing out that user has to be in  relation to the trademark used for the goods in question and mere invoices are not enough.

Plaintiff has taken a categorical stand before this Court in the replication and has also placed additional documents on record that the dates of user in some of these applications, i.e., the first five in the table above, have been erroneously mentioned on account of a typographical error and steps have been taken before the Registrar of Trade Marks for rectification.

                        "content": "The next and the only question that requires consideration is if the Plaintiff has prima facie established her claim of passing off against the Defendant. Passing off is a common law remedy and is founded on desirability of preventing commercial immorality or dishonesty by a trader, who by using a particular mark, whether registered or unregistered, falsely represents that his goods are goods of someone else so as to take undue and unfair advantage of the reputation of the other person, as held in Delco Engineering Works v. General Motors Corporation, 1971 SCC OnLine P & H 337. Since passing off, which is a common law tort, does not owe its origin to a Statute, it is not corseted by the provisions under the Act with respect to infringement. The necessary ingredients required to be established for passing off have been laid down in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), viz. (a) misrepresentation by a trader in the course of trade to prospective customers; and (b) deliberate and calculated intent to encash upon and cause damage to the reputation and goodwill of the other trader. In Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC 145, it  was held that for establishing passing off, there must be sale by the Defendant of its goods/services in a manner which is likely to confuse and deceive the public into thinking that goods or services are of the Plaintiff. Plaintiff has to establish goodwill and reputation as well as the loss or likelihood of loss. ‘Confusion’, as held in several judgments, is a state of mind of a customer who, on seeing the mark thinks that it differs from the mark on the goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful whether the impression is not due to imperfect recollection. With respect to the parameters of passing off, I may refer to the judgment in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), para 35 whereof is as follows:  “35. Broadly stated, in an action for passing-off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally for deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors are to be considered:  (a)  The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite marks i.e. both words and label works.  (b)  The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.  (c)  The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.  (d)  The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders.  (e)  The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using the goods.  (f)  The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.  (g)  Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity between the competing marks.”",

                        "content": "Going by the broad parameters set out in the aforesaid judgment, Court would now require to examine the nature of the trademarks, i.e., APPLESTREE and NUAPPLEPLANT. A perusal of the rival marks, in my prima facie view, shows that APPLE is a prominent part of the trademark of the Plaintiff and copying the prominent part, especially when the competing products are identical, would lead to deceptive similarity. Defendant has copied the essential part of Plaintiff’s trademarks and has merely added the suffix PLANT as well as a prefix NU thereto. Relying on the judgment of this Court in Goenka Institute of Eduation & Research v. Anjani Kumar Goenka & Anr., 2009 SCC OnLine Del 1691, a Division Bench of this Court in M/s Kirorimal Kashiram Makreting & Agencies Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. Shree Sita Chawal Udyog Mill, 2010 SCC OnLine Del 2933, held that no one can copy an essential part or predominant part of a trademark and benefit of prior use doctorine will also be available to an essential or prominent part of the trademark. In the said case, the registered trademark of the Plaintiff was ‘Double Deer’ and it had sought a restraint against the Defendant from use of the mark ‘Golden Deer’. After analysing the judgment of the learned Single Judge who had come to a finding that there was no chance of confusion, the Division Bench observed that ‘Deer’ was a prominent part of the trademark of the Appellant and copying the same would lead to deceptive similarity, particularly when the products were same. The mark was arbitrary in respect of the product rice and was entitled to a high degree of protection. Another judgment which is of relevance in the instant case is in the case of M/s. Amar Singh Chawal Wala v. M/s. Shree Vardhman Rice and Genl. Mills, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 1690, where the registered trademarks of the Plaintiff were ‘GOLDEN QILLA’, ‘LAL  QILLA CHAPP’, ‘LAL QILLA’ and ‘NEEL QILLA’ and the trademark sought to be injuncted was ‘HARA QILLA’ with the product in question being rice. The Division Bench held as follows:- “15. The submissions of the parties have been considered. It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff has in its favour registration of the four marks and devices as noticed hereinbefore. The suit filed by the Plaintiff is essentially one for infringement in respect of the Plaintiffs trade mark on the ground that the use by the Defendants of the mark and device HARA QILLA and QILLA respectively would cause confusion and deception among the users and the trade in general. The distinction between a suit based on infringement and that based on passing off was explained by the Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durea Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, AIR 1965 SC 980. It was explained that “while action for passing off is a common law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another, that is not the gist of an action for infringement. The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the ‘exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods.’ The use by the Defendant of the trade mark of the Plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement.” It was further noticed that “where the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of a registered trade mark, the essential features of both the actions might coincide, in an action for infringement, the Plaintiff must, no doubt, make out that the defendant's mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court should reach the conclusion that there is an imitation” in which event it would be established that the Plaintiffs rights are violated. The Supreme Court went on to further explain that “if the essential features of a trade mark of the Plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get up, packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sales show  marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the Plaintiff.”  xxx  xxx  xxx",

                        "content": "In the instant case as far as the registered marks in favour of the Plaintiff are concerned, applying the test laid down in Kaviraj Pandit it is seen that the essential feature of the mark is the word ‘QILLA’. Whether the word is spelt as QILLA or K.ILLA, or even written in a different style or colour combination. To the customer who seeks to purchase the QILLA brand rice both names would sound phonetically similar. The customer is likely to ask the retailer: “Can I have the QILLA brand rice?” In the considered view of this Court, it is this essential feature of the Plaintiffs mark, i.e. the word QILLA, which has been adopted by the Defendant No. 1. That the defendants have also used a pictorial representation of the device in the form of a fort also indicates that the Defendants too intended the same meaning to be assigned to the word, which is an Urdu one meaning “fort”. Therefore, though the device QILLA is depicted in a slightly different way by the defendant, it is deceptively similar to the device used by the Plaintiff. Further the use is in respect of the same commodity, rice. Therefore there is every possibility f there being a confusion created in the mind of the purchaser of rice that the product being sold by the Defendant is in fact a product that has emanated from or has been manufactured by the Plaintiff.",

                        "content": "It is not possible to agree with the reasoning of the learned Single Judge that the word QILLA is not associated with rice and therefore no ordinary purchaser of rice would associate the Defendant's mark as that of the Plaintiffs. It is plain from the pleadings that the Plaintiff has been using the words QILLA consistently in connection with the rice being sold by them with only the first word indicating the colour viz., GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA. It must be held that the Plaintiff has been able to prima facie show that it has developed a ‘family of  marks’ and that by merely changing the first word from GOLDEN, LAL or NEELA to the word HARA there is every possibility of confusion being caused both in trade and in the mind of any person desiring to purchase rice. Likewise the use of the picture or depiction of a fort in the background on the label/packing of the rice is also likely to cause confusion in the mind of the purchaser and in the trade that the product being sold by the Defendants are in fact those manufactured by the Plaintiff.”",

In Greaves Cotton Limited v. Mr. Mohammad Rafi & Ors., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 2596, this Court held that neither deletion of a part of a registered trademark nor the prefix or suffix of another word to it would validate the use of a trademark by an unlicensed user, as this would not even be in the interest of a consumer who would buy the product under an impression that both products emanate from the same source, more particularly, where the quality of the product is different. In K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Shri Ambal and Co., Madras and Another, (1969) 2 SCC 131, the question before the Court was whether the two marks ‘Sri Andal’ and ‘Sri Ambal’ were deceptively similar. Noting that the word ‘Ambal’ was an essential feature of the trademarks, the Court was of the view that the name ‘Andal’ proposed to be used by the Appellant would not cease to be deceptively similar only because it was used in conjunction with a pictorial device. Judged on these judgments, in my view, the impugned mark NUAPPLEPLANT is deceptively similar to Plaintiff’s mark APPLESTREE when compared and seen visually.",

                        "content": "In my prima facie view, learned counsel for the Plaintiff is also right in contending that not only there is a visual similarity in the competing marks but the two are also similar in idea i.e. semantic similarity. The concept of semantic similarity was brought forth by the Supreme Court in the case of Corn Products Refining Co. (supra), wherein it was held that ‘Gluvita’ was likely to cause confusion with the mark ‘Glucovita’ as both conveyed the same idea of glucose and vitamins. In Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. (supra), a Division Bench of this Court observed that in a discussion pertaining to similarity between word marks, a semantic understanding of how commonness of idea is conveyed through the use of words is relevant. In semantics, there are broadly three sense relations: ‘Hyponyms’, ‘Synonyms’ and ‘Antonyms’. Examining in detail the three concepts the Division Bench posed a question whether the words ‘Officer’ and ‘Collector’ were deceptively similar and in this context observed that similar ideas are associated in the brain and this association plays an important role at the time of retrieval of information. The Court referred to the book on Cognitive Psychology, Solso Et. Al Ed. VIII relating to various theories on how knowledge is stored in the human mind and the crux was that similar words, concepts and items that are linked by association are grouped together in the brain. After cogitating on the issue, the Court observed as under:- “57. So, when a consumer has to make a decision regarding a purchase, and is confronted with the product of the appellant with the mark ‘Collector's Choice’, the word ‘Collector’ shall bring to his mind the cue ‘Person holding an office of authority’ which is related to the word ‘Officer’ since both trademarks in the present case are used in the same context for whisky. As discussed above, this cue may guide the consumer in confusing  the appellant's whisky with that of the respondent or may generate a false memory that will lead to confusion.",

                        "content": "In my prima facie view, the present case completely fits into the facts and enunciation of law in the aforesaid judgment. Study of semantic theory goes back to the founder of common linguistics, W. Hunbodt. The theory suggests that the words in the English language system are so related that  they form a complete lexical system and a grouping, i.e., genus and species. As an illustration, under this concept, purple, pink, white, brown, violet etc. would fall under the genus ‘colours’ and similarly, knives, spoons, forks would have a semantic relationship with the genus ‘cutlery’. Synonymy would cover the semantic field where words have nearly the same meanings such that they can be interchanged in some degree and most common cases under this head are of relative synonymy as it is difficult to find words which are absolute synonyms of each other. The words PLANT and TREE, in my view, are a classic example of synonymy where reading one would bring to the mind of a purchaser the other, which he may have seen as a part of the trademark on an earlier occasion but is unable to decipher the difference on account of imperfect recollection. This confusion will be enhanced where the two trademarks are used for identical products and class of purchasers and trade channels are identical, as in this case. No purchaser, while buying the products such as Abrasive Paper, will dissect the trademark to find a scientific (botanical) difference between a PLANT and TREE, especially when both are even otherwise synonymous to each other. A purchaser with average intelligence and imperfect recollection would go by the overall and first impression of the trademark and the similarity in idea is likely to cause confusion.",

Defendant has carefully and consciously chosen to adopt the impugned trademark in the year 2019, while for several years, he was selling the same products under a different name. The concidence does not stop at using a deceptively similar mark or the point in time when the user started but also overlaps with the manner in which the mark is used. A comparative  of the packaging/label/outer carton of the Plaintiff’s product with that of the Defendant’s product would show that the background of both is a dark pink color, the color combination is pink and white, both have image of an apple on the label and in my view, the similarities outweigh the trivial dissimilarities. This Court is also of the prima facie view that the adoption of the impugned trademark by the Defendant is dishonest. Defendant has been unable to give a plausible explanation as to how he came across and decided to use the mark APPLE as a part of its trademark, considering that Apple has no association with the products, such as, Abrasive Papers etc. By his own showing, Defendant has been in the business of the said products since the year 2015 under a different name and there cannot be a sudden and automatic association of the word APPLE with the product, such as, Abrasive Paper. A comparative of the two is as under:- Plaintiff’s packaging/label  Defendant’s packaging/label",

                        "content": "Viewing the two trademarks, the prima facie conclusion that this Court draws is that an attempt has been made by the Defendant to pass off  his goods under the impugned trademark by coming as close as possible to the Plaintiff’s packaging/label in terms of colour combination, background colour, graphics, etc. In Colgate Palmolive Company & Another v. Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd., 2003 SCC OnLine Del 1005, this Court has emphasized on the significance of trade dress and colour combination, observing that the two elements are so important that in some cases even single colour has been taken to be a trademark to be protected in a passing off action, save and except, in exceptional cases, where colours cannot be protected, such as blue colour for ink and red colour for lipstick. In the said case, despite the fact that the words “Colgate” and “Anchor” were distinct with not even an iota of similarity, either in look or in sound, the Court found that the ingredients of trade dress, get up, colour combination, layout of the packing were significant and relevant factors for determining passing off. The Court observed that this criteria flows from the concept of action of passing off developed over the years that it is the similarities and not the dissimilarities which determine whether the action for passing off is made out or not. If similarities of trade dress are substantial from the look of the two goods, it was held that it comes within the mischief of passing off. In Slazenger & Sons v. Feltham & Co. (1899) 6 RPC 531, Lord Lindely, LJ observed ‘One must exercise one’s common sense, and, if you are driven to the conclusion that what is intended to be done is to deceive is possible, I do not think it is stretching the imagination very much to credit the man with occasional success or possible success. Why should we be astute to say that he cannot succeed in doing that which he is straining every nerve to do?’ In Munday v. Carey, (1905) R.P.C. 273, Kekewich, J. Observed, ‘Where you see dishonesty, then even though the similarity were less than it is here, you  ought, I think, to pay great attention to the items of similarity, and less to the items of dissimilarity.’",

In the written statement, Defendant has not seriously traversed the averments or the sales figures and has simply denied the same for want of knowledge. At this prima facie stage, the veracity of the sales figures brought forth by the Plaintiff is not required to be gone into and would be a subject matter of trial. Prima facie case of reputation and goodwill has been established by the Plaintiff and given the fact that Defendant has adopted a deceptively similar mark for the same products, which are sold through identical trade channels with same consumer base, misrepresentation by the Defendant is likely to cause confusion amongst the purchasers and the members of the trade.

In my prima facie view, the argument does not aid the Defendant. The latter contention can be straightaway rejected on account of the fact that Defendant has not placed any material on record to show actual user by third-parties of the trademarks alleged to be similar to the Plaintiff’s  trademark. Learned counsel for the Plaintiff is also right in urging that it is not open to the Defendant to even raise a plea that the word APPLE is generic or descriptive as he has himself applied for its registration. This proposition flows from the judgments in Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan & Anr., 1999 SCC OnLine Del 27 and The Indian Hotels Company Ltd. v. Ashwajeet Garg and Ors., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 2826. The relevant observations in Automatic Electric Limited (supra) are as follows:- “The defendants got their trade mark “DIMMER DOT” registered in Australia. The fact that the defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary right and monopoly in “DIMMER DOT”, it does not lie in their mouth to say that the word “DIMMER” is a generic expression. User of the word “DIMMER” by others cannot be a defense available to the defendants, if it could be shown that the same is being used in violation of the statutory right of the plaintiff.”  In The Indian Hotels Company Ltd. (supra), the Court held as under:- “It was next argued by Mr. Rohtagi that the word ‘JIVA’ is a descriptive word which cannot be protected as a trade mark by a Civil Court. We do not think so, the appellant has itself applied for registration of the Jiva as a trade mark and cannot, Therefore, argue that the mark is descriptive. In Automatic Electric Limited. v. R.K. Dhawan 1999 PTC (91) 81 this court has in similar circumstances repelled the contention and held that since the defendant had itself sought to claim a proprietary right and monopoly in “DIMMER DOT”, the disputed trade mark it did not lie in its mouth to say that the said mark was a generic expression.”",

As noted above, the matter is pending before the Registrar and it would not be only premature but would also be inappropriate at this stage to give any finding in this regard, least of all a finding of concealment/misrepresentation as alleged by the Defendant.

As we said in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd. [(1960) (1) SCR 968] the question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara” is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two composite words “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. We do not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, split the name into its component parts and consider the etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite words as “current of nectar” or “current of Lakshman”. He would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see the difference between “current of nectar” and “current of Lakshman”. “Current of Lakshman” in a literal sense has no meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the inference that the “current or  stream” is as pure and strong as Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. He would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.",

                        "content": "We agree that the use of the word “dhara” which literally means “current or stream” is not by itself decisive of the matter. What we have to consider here is the overall similarity of the composite words, having regard to the circumstance that the goods bearing the two names are medicinal preparations of the same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to be refused, because unusually stupid people, “fools or idiots”, may be deceived. A critical comparison of the two names may disclose some points of difference, but an unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two names having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat vague recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name. The trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be considered. In the case of the application to register “Erectiks” (opposed by the proprietors of the trade mark “Erector”) Farwell, J., said in William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52 RPC 137] : “I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a part of the other word; one word must be considered as a whole and compared with the other word as a whole…. I think it is a dangerous method to adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a portion of the other word.”  (Emphasis supplied)",

The impugned order is a cryptic and non-reasoned order as a bare reading of the same would reflect. It is the statutory obligation of the Respondent to pass a reasoned and speaking order furnishing reasons for declining to grant the patent. Respondent has failed to appreciate that present invention meets the requirements of inventive step and without considering that the claimed medicament combination is not known from any of the prior arts or its combinations, Respondent has rejected the  application. Elaborating the arguments, it is submitted that Respondent failed to support his conclusion by showing that a skilled person would be able to arrive at the claimed invention based on the cited prior art D1 to D4 and wrongly applied hindsight analysis to pick and choose from numerous possibilities, without looking to the fact that synergy is an unpredictable phenomenon. This approach is against the decision by the Board of Appeals of the European Patent Office T-0970 dated 15.09.2004 ruling that prior disclosure must not be distorted or misinterpreted based on hindsight knowledge. In F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. & Anr. v. Cipla Ltd., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13619, this Court has held that hindsight is impermissible while conducting an enquiry into obviousness and the legal conclusion must be reached on the basis of facts gleaned from the prior art and should not include knowledge from patent disclosure.",

D1 discloses a compound in a Markush-type claim, including Brexpiprazole, for use and treatment of Central Nervous System disorders, but does not disclose that synergistic effects can be obtained by combination use of Brexpiprazole with other drugs. Moreover, D1 does not disclose that Brexpiprazole can be used in combination with other drugs. D4 relates to Aripiprazole and does not disclose that Brexpiprazole can be used in combination with other drugs or the synergistic effects shown by combination of Brexpiprazole and other drugs. Aripiprazole and Brexpiprazole are structurally different and these differences have a huge impact on the receptor binding profile and consequently, on the physiological effects of the drugs.

Section 3(d) is meant to prevent ever-greening of patents. Impugned order is based on application of incorrect standards for determining inventive step requirement.

The patent application is a mere combination of Brexpiprazole with already known drugs only with new therapeutic uses. There is no inventive step as the compositions and combinations of products are known in the cited prior art documents. Subject matter of claims 1 to 6 lack inventive step under Section 2(1)(ja) of the Act, in view of documents D1 to D4, with regard to efficacy over the parent/base compound and the data provided is not sufficient to establish significant improvement in properties over the prior art parent compounds. Insofar as the contention of the Appellant that documents D2 and D3 which were never cited in the hearing notice, have been considered by the Respondent while finally adjudicating the matter, is concerned, Mr. Harish fairly concedes that this is an error on the face of the record.",

There is no mention of D2 and D3 as rightly pointed by learned counsel for the Appellant. Relevant part of the hearing notice is extracted hereunder:- “The reply submission by the applicant is not persuasive as D4 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising: (i) at least onecarbostyril derivatives (i.e. i.e. aripiprazole) in combination with (ii) at least one serotoninreuptake inhibitor, and (iii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (p. 6, line 6-11). It also discloses that the serotonin reuptake inhibitor can be fluoxetine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline and escitalopram, and salts thereof (p.7, line 22-26). D4 also discloses a method for treating major depressive disorder by administering to a patient with major depressive disorder said composition (p.12, line 19-25). D1 discloses a heterocyclic compound of formula (I) or salts thereof, which the preferable compound (I) is 7-[4-(4-benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl-piperazin-1-yl)butoxy]-1 H-quinolin-2-one (p.12, line 10-14: see Compound (1)). D1 discloses that the above compound of formula (I) can be provided in a pharmaceutical composition as an active ingredient mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the treatment or prevention of central nervous system disorders, i.e. major depression (p. 13, line 16-23; & p. 14, line 4 ). A person skilled in the art would have been motivated to combine the teachings of D1 with D4 to produce a new composition for use in the very same treatment of major depressive disorder, and it is prima facie obvious to combine two compositions each of which is taught by the prior art to be useful for the same purpose, in order to form a third composition to be used for the very same purpose. Hence the subject matter of claims 1-8 lacks inventive step u/s 2(1)(ja) of the Patents Act, 1970 in view of the prior art D1 and D4.”",

In yet another matter in Resprotect GmbH vs The Controller of Patents & Designs & Anr., IPAB Case No. OA/23/2010/PT/DEL, it was held that the Patent Office while dealing with grant of patent, exercises quasi-judicial power and a quasi-judicial authority is not an adversary of the patent applicant.

This action of the Respondent is clearly in the teeth of the doctrine of audi alterem partem and is sufficient to remand the matter for fresh adjudication. This Court also finds that the Appellant had specifically objected to application of Section 3(d) of the Act in determining claims 1 to 6. However, the impugned order shows that the Respondent has not dealt with the arguments made by the Appellant or the judgments cited in this context. Respondent has come to a conclusion on non-patentability under Section 3(d) of the Act by simply observing that claims 1 to 6 are mere new use of known substances, with no significant difference with regard to efficacy over the parent/base compound. No reasons are discernible in the order which weighed with the Respondent to arrive at the said conclusion and the impugned order cannot be termed anything but cryptic and unreasoned.",

The invention sought to be patented by the Appellant is based on the finding that synergistic effects can be obtained by the combination of ‘Component-1’: 7-[4-(4-benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl-piperazin-1-yl) butoxy]-lH-quinolin-2-one (hereinafter Brexpiprazole) or a salt thereof and  ‘Component-2’: at least one drug selected from the group consisting of (i) serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); or (ii) a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); or (iii) an anti-anxiety drug selected from diazepam or a salt thereof. D1 and D4 were cited as prior art. Appellant had brought out that D1 does not disclose that synergistic effects can be obtained by combination use of Brexpiprazole with other drugs and also does not disclose that Brexpiprazole can be used in combination with other drugs. D4 related to Aripiprazole and it was brought out that D4 does not disclose that Brexpiprazole can be used in combination with other drugs. Moreover, D4 does not disclose synergistic effects by the combination of Brexpiprazole and other drugs. In order to distinguish the prior art, Appellant had categorically pointed out that Aripiprazole and Brexpiprazole are structurally different on three points, viz: (1) the presence or absence of a double bond in the carbostyril structure; (2) the substituent on the Piperazine ring (phenyl group in Aripiprazole vs. Benzothiophene in Brexpiprazole); and (3) the presence or absence of the substituents on the substituent (2) above (2,3-dichloro-substituted in Aripiprazole vs. unsubstituted in Brexpiprazole) and also that such differences have a large impact on the receptor binding profile and consequently, on the physiological effects of the drugs.",

It was thus the stand of the Appellant that Brexpiprazole is functionally different from Aripiprazole and, therefore, synergistic effects of the combination of Brexpiprazole with  a serotonin reuptake inhibitor; or a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; or an anti anxiety drug, cannot be expected in view of D4 disclosing Aripiprazole, which is structurally and functionally different from Brexpiprazole.

Non-recording of reasons could lead to dual infirmities, firstly, it may cause prejudice to the affected party and secondly, hamper proper administration of justice. A judgment without reasons causes prejudice to the person against whom it is delivered as the litigant is unable to know the grounds which weighed with the Court in rejecting his claim as also caused impediments in his taking adequate and appropriate grounds before the higher Court in case of challenge to the judgment.

                        "content": "From a holistic understanding of the opposing stands of the respective parties, gathered from the present application, which has sketchy pleadings, brief note of arguments submitted on behalf of the Defendant and the arguments canvassed in Court, the contentions raised can be summarized as follows:- A.  Learned counsel appearing for the Defendant/applicant contended:  (a)  Defendant is a registered proprietor of the impugned trademark JIWAN DHARA under No.624249 in Class 29 dated 04.04.1994 and the registration is valid and subsisting. Thus, no suit for alleged infringement of a registered trademark can lie against the Defendant by virtue of provisions of Sections 28(3) and 30(2)(e) of the Act. Being barred by law, the plaint deserves to be rejected at the threshold. By virtue of Section 29 of the Act, the suit would be barred not only against a registered proprietor but also against a “Permitted User”. This position is further fortified from the provisions of Section 29 of the Act which postulates that a trademark is infringed by a person who is not a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use and Section 30(2)(e) which provides that a registered trademark is not infringed where the use of the said mark is in exercise of the right to use, given by registration under the Act. In view of these statutory provisions, Plaintiff cannot claim the relief of infringement against the Defendant and the suit deserves to be dismissed.  (b)  Filing of an application by the Plaintiff under Section 124 of the Act is of no consequence and cannot come to the aid of the Plaintiff. Reading of Section 124(1) with Section 28(3) and Section 29(1) & (2) makes it explicitly clear that Section 124(1) comes into play when on the date of the filing of the suit for infringement, it is the Plaintiff who is the registered proprietor and the Defendant is neither a registered proprietor nor a permitted user. Section 124(1)(b) contemplates three separate and distinct alternatives, viz. (i) Defendant becomes a registered proprietor during the pendency of the suit; (ii) during the pendency of the suit, Defendant approaches a separate registered proprietor ‘X’ and obtains a permitted use from him; and (iii) during the pendency of the suit, Defendant approaches another registered proprietor ‘X’ and obtains a permitted use from him against whom Plaintiff has already filed a cancellation petition before the appropriate Forum. Therefore, if prior to the filing of the suit, either the Defendant or the Plaintiff has filed a cancellation petition against the other, as envisaged in situation (iii), the suit shall be stayed. If subsequent to filing of the suit, alternative (ii) occurs and/or Defendant has not filed any prior cancellation petition before the suit, Section 124(1)(b)(ii) comes into play. Therefore, provisions of Section 124 of the Act would only come into play subsequent to a suit for infringement having been filed against the Defendant, who on the date of filing of the suit is neither a registered proprietor nor a permitted user.  Since the Defendant was a registered proprietor before the filing of the suit, which fact has been concealed by the Plaintiff, provisions of Section 124 of the Act cannot be invoked by the Plaintiff. In any case, Plaintiff has not pleaded invalidity of registration of Defendant’s trademark and, therefore, Section 124 is even otherwise inapplicable.  (c)  Learned counsel has relied on the judgments in S. Syed Mohideen v. P. Sulochana Bai, (2016) 2 SCC 683, N.R. Dongre And Others v. Whirlpool Corporation And Another, 1995 SCC OnLine Del 310, and in M/s Satyadeva Bokaro & Anr. v. M/s Sachdeva College Limited, FAO(OS) No.116/2016, dated 01.08.2016, for the proposition that a registered proprietor cannot assert infringement against another registered proprietor and the suit must fail.  (d)  Reliance was placed on the judgments of the Supreme Court in State of Haryana v. Suresh, (2007) 15 SCC 186; Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab, (2014) 3 SCC 92 and Rohitash Kumar v. Om Prakash Sharma, (2013) 11 SCC 451 to argue that one of the basic principles of interpretation of Statutes is to construe them according to plain, literal and grammatical meaning of the words used by the Legislature. Plaintiff has relied on several judgments for the proposition that a harmonious construction must be given for the purpose of interpreting Sections 28(3), 29(1) and (2) of the Act on one hand and Section 124 of the Act on the other. The judgments are wholly inapplicable to the present case, as the rule of  harmonious construction would only apply if there is a conflict between provisions, whereas in the present case, there is no conflict between the said provisions.  B.  Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Plaintiff per contra contended as follows:- (a)  Contention of the Defendant that the present suit is not maintainable and the plaint deserves to be rejected on the ground that one registered proprietor cannot sue the other registered proprietor, is wholly misconceived. It is wrong to contend that the relief of infringement of the impugned trademark, sought by the Plaintiff, is barred under law. Submission of the Defendant is contrary to the Scheme of the Act including Section 124 thereof. Whenever in any suit for infringement, a plea regarding invalidity of the registration of the Plaintiff or Defendant’s trademark is raised, which is prima facie found to be tenable, the Court frames an issue and adjourns the case for three months to enable the party concerned to apply for cancellation of the trademark and rectification of the Register.  (b)  It is a settled law that where in a suit for infringement of registered trademark, Defendant raises a defence under Section 30(2)(e) of the Act and Plaintiff questions the validity of the registration of Defendant’s mark, an issue as to invalidity of registration has to be framed and the suit has to be stayed for determination of the issue of invalidity by the appropriate Forum. If the suit is dismissed at the threshold, as  urged by the Defendant, no occasion would arise for filing of an application under Section 124 of the Act and framing of issue on invalidity, which would deprive the concerned party of resorting to remedies available in law for seeking cancellation of the registered trademark of the opposite party.  (c)  Learned Senior Counsel relied on the following judgments, which shall be adverted to in later part of the judgment:- (i)  Dabur India Limited v. Alka Ayurvedic Pvt. Ltd., 2017 SCC OnLine Del 7268;  (ii)  Raj Kumar Prasad and Another v. Abbott Healthcare (P) Ltd., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 7708;  (iii) Clinique Laboratories Llc and Another v. Gufic Limited and Another, 2009 SCC OnLine Del 751;  (iv) Dabur India v. Real Drinks Pvt. Ltd. and Anr., 2014 SCC OnLine Del 23; and  (v)  Singer Company Limited & Anr. v.

If the registration is invalid, it would be invalid ab initio i.e. no registration though declared to be so later and a plaintiff who pleads so cannot be deprived of suing for infringement. It is however axiomatic that if such a plaintiff fails before the Registrar of Trade Marks or the IPAB, as the case may be, in  establishing invalidity, his suit for infringement which under Section 124 has to be stayed, would fail. However, if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing invalidity, then he would be entitled to proceed with the suit for infringement.",

Registration has been made only prima-facie evidence of the registration otherwise being in accordance with the Act under Section 31(1) as contended by senior counsel for plaintiff but I find that even Section 28(1) while being subject to other provisions of Act, further provides that “registration of the trademark, if valid, give to the registered proprietor” exclusive right to use the trademark. Thus the validity of registration can be gone into, wherever permissible under the Act. Section  124(1)(b) also indicates that it was within the contemplation of the legislature that there could be a suit for infringement of trademark where the defendant takes a plea under Section 30(2)(e) i.e. that use by him is not infringement because of his mark being also registered. The legislature while further providing for stay of suit in such cases, in sub Section (5) expressly provided that such stay would not preclude the court from making any interlocutory order. Section 31 r/w the scheme of 124 leads to an un-escapable conclusion that (A) there can be a suit for infringement against the registered proprietor (B) that upon the defendant taking the plea of his registration and of there being thus no infringement, such suit has to be stayed awaiting the rectification proceedings and (C) the court is empowered in such case to pass any interlocutory order. The court while passing interlocutory order will necessarily have to prima facie adjudicate the validity of the two competing registrations. Upon inquiry, it was informed that the Registrar while trying the rectification application has no power to grant interim relief. The legislature under Section 124(5) has thus empowered the court under Section 124(5) to grant injunction against use of a registered trademark also if the court is satisfied of the invalidity thereof. Though in view of Section 31, the test would be much stricter;",

In fact, sub-clause (i) of 124(1) shows that the suit can be instituted even where the rectification proceedings are pending i.e. where the plaintiff is even at the time of institution of the suit aware of the defendant having a registered trademark.",

Section 31(2) suggests that the court notwithstanding registration being prima-facie evidence of validity as provided in Section 31(1) can hold the registered trademark to be invalid. The court can hold the registration to be invalid, on any ground or for non compliance of any of the conditions for registration provided under the Act. It further provides that if the invalidity of registration is averred for the reason of non compliance of Section 9(1), i.e. of evidence of distinctiveness having not been submitted before the Registrar, then the party pleading validity of registration shall be entitled to give evidence in legal proceedings where validity is challenged, of the mark having acquired distinctiveness on date of registration. Section 32 permits evidence of acquisition of distinctive character within the meaning of Section 9(1) post registration, also being led in such proceedings. It follows that where validity of registration is challenged on grounds other than provided in Section 9(1) of the Act, the test is whether the criteria laid down in such other provisions of the Act, for registration has been satisfied or not. Since, Section 124 otherwise provides for stay of proceedings in such suit and only permits passing an interlocutory order, such finding of invalidity naturally has to be on the touchstone of principles for interlocutory order only and not as at the time of final decision of the suit, in as much as the finding in the rectification proceedings has been otherwise made binding in the suit and on all aspects of validity i.e. under Section 9 as well as under Section 11.",

The question that arises next is whether Section 28(3) of the TM Act bars the Plaintiff from suing Defendant No. 1 for infringement, since both are the registered proprietors of identical marks. In the first place, it must be noted that under Section 28 read with Section 31 of the TM Act, the protection to a mark is conditional upon its validity. Further, Section 124 applies to a situation where the Plaintiff may not have challenged the validity of the registration of the rival mark at the time of filing the suit, but does so subsequently. In the instant case, the Plaintiff has applied for rectification of the mark of Defendant No. 1 and the proceedings arising therefrom is pending before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (TRAIT). Therefore, it is possible for the Plaintiff to contend that the question whether Section 28 (3) of the TM Act precludes the Plaintiff from seeking to restrain Defendant No. 1 from infringing its mark will have to await the decision of the IPAB on the Plaintiff's challenge to the validity of the registration in favour of Defendant No. 1. That stage is yet to be reached. Therefore, the fact that Defendant No. 1 is a registered proprietor of an identical mark in the same class cannot preclude the Plaintiff from seeking to restrain Defendant No. 1 from using the mark ‘REAL’.”",

One of the grounds raised by the Defendants was that no suit for infringement is maintainable against the Defendants in view of Section 30(2)(e) of the Act. Examining the provisions of Section 124 of the Act, Court was of the prima facie view that the plaint could not be rejected at the threshold and the suit can lie though it may have to be stayed depending upon the defence raised by the Defendants. At this stage, I may also refer to a judgment of the High  Court of Allahabad in Rohit Surfactants Private Limited NOW RSPL Limited v. Manodia Salt Company Private Limited and Another, 2013 SCC OnLine All 14666. The Court was dealing with a revision petition directed against an order passed by the learned Trial Court whereby it had directed that the application filed by the Plaintiff under Section 124 of the Act would be decided after the application of the Defendant under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. The contention of the Petitioner before the High Court was that when a plea regarding invalidity of the registration of either the Plaintiff or the Defendant’s trademark is raised, which is prima facie tenable, Court has to frame an issue and adjourn the case for three months to enable the party concerned to apply for rectification of the Register and, therefore, if the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is heard first and the plaint is rejected, the occasion to examine the plea raised under Section 124 would not arise, which is exactly the plea raised by the Plaintiff in the present case. Dealing with the contention, the Court held as under:  “8. Clearly the provisions of Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the Trade Marks Act would precede consideration of an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure for rejection of the plaint for the reason that when no such proceeding is pending and there is prima facie satisfaction of the court under Section 124(1)(b)(ii) of the Trade Marks Act than the court in the suit has to raise the issue and adjourn the case for rectification in the register. Such order would send the rectification matter within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Board. It is only there after that the application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure would became maintainable.",

In Dabur v. Alka (supra), this Court also observed that Section 28(3) of the Act does not prohibit a suit for infringement if the mark of the Defendant is also registered. Section 28(1), by a plain reading, vests in the registered proprietor of the trademark, the exclusive right to use the mark in any manner provided by the Act. Thus, the exclusive right vested in the registered proprietor is subject to the other provisions of the Act and to the registration being valid. As a corollary, if there is another provision in the Act not vesting such an exclusive right in the registered proprietor or if the registration is invalid, such exclusive right would not vest in the registered proprietor of the mark. It was further observed that the words ‘the exclusive right to the use of any of those trademarks’ in Section 28(3) would have to take colour from the exclusive right conferred under Section 28(1) which would not accrue if the registration is invalid.",

Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff has rightly contended that the contentions of the Defendant are based on a misreading of the provisions of the Act, as none of these provisions bar filing of a suit for infringement against a registered proprietor and to the contrary, Section 124 of the Act is an enabling provision which contemplates the filing of such a suit and the course of action that needs to be adopted during the pendency of the suit where the Defendant raises a defence under Section 30(2)(e) of the Act that its mark is also registered and Plaintiff pleads invalidity of the Defendant’s mark. No doubt, if the registration is found to be invalid, it would be invalid ab initio, but if the Plaintiff fails in the cancellation proceedings in establishing invalidity, the suit would fail. This, however, cannot imply that at the outset, the Plaintiff should be deprived of an opportunity to establish the invalidity by dismissing the suit. This view is fortified by Section 124(5) of the Act which goes a step further and gives discretion to the Court to make an interlocutory order even while staying the proceedings in the suit. In the absence of any specific or explicit bar excluding the Court’s jurisdiction from entertaining such a suit, this Court finds no reason to reject the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 CPC in the light of the statutory provisions and scheme of the Act as well as plethora of judicial precedence, aforementioned.",

                        "content": "It also needs a mention that Plaintiff has already filed an application under Section 124 of the Act which is pending consideration and if the plaint is rejected at this stage, Plaintiff would be deprived of its right under Section 124 of the Act to plead invalidity of the registration of the impugned  mark and this would render Section 124 of the Act redundant, which would be against the settled principles of law that every phrase, sentence and word used by the Legislature must be given effect to. This Court also finds no merit in the contention of the Defendant that Plaintiff has not raised a plea of invalidity of registration of Defendant’s trademark, as a mere reading of the application under Section 124 of the Act, being I.A. 2946/2018, shows to the contrary.",

In any case, the goods of the defendant no.1 are in Classes 24 and 25, in which the plaintiff does not have any registration.",

                        "content": "Keeping in view the above parameters, in my view, the plaintiff has not been able to make out a prima facie case for grant of prohibitory interim injunction against the defendant no.1. As noted hereinabove, the registration and use of the mark of the plaintiff is in a device of it, though ‘VASUNDHRA’ is a predominant part. Equally, ‘VASUNDHRA’ is a common name in India and an exclusive right to use the same cannot be granted to the plaintiff. The goods of the plaintiff and the defendant no.1, though cognate, are distinct. Presently, the plaintiff has not even contended that it has plans of trade progression, that is, to expand its  business to other goods including those of the defendant no.1. The area of operation of the plaintiff and the defendant no.1 is also distinct; with the plaintiff being in Delhi, while the defendant no.1 being predominantly in the State of Gujarat. The defendant no.1 also has developed suitable goodwill of the mark in its favour, as is evident from its claim of having a gross sale of Rs. 13.30 Crore approximately between the period of December, 2020 to April 2022. Merely because the plaintiff deals in jewellery items, which by themselves are more costly thereby resulting in a higher turnover for the plaintiff, will not give a better right to the plaintiff over an otherwise a common name in India.",
