The said affidavit stated that the proceedings on 26th February, 2020 were handwritten and counter signed by advocates for both parties. The said affidavit also stated that the impugned order was uploaded on 11th June, 2020. On the next date before the Court, i.e., 6th October, 2020, after perusing the affidavit filed on behalf of Respondent No.1, it was found that the same was not satisfactory and, further directions were issued  to Respondent No.1 to answer specifically the following questions:  •9. It is noticed that even as on today, the evidence purported to have been filed under Rule 45/Rule 47 by the Respondent/Opponent is not available online on the TMR•s website. This Court is of the opinion that the affidavit of the Registrar of Trade Marks is clearly not in compliance with the order passed by this Court on 10th June, 2020. It is the duty of the Registrar of Trade Marks to comply with the order both in letter and in spirit. The dates on which the exact evidence was filed by the opponent had to be clarified in the affidavit, which the affidavit clearly does not. Under these circumstances, it is deemed appropriate to direct that the affidavit shall be filed by Shri. Hoshiar Singh, the Head of Trademark Registry, Delhi office, after enquiring into the matter fully, within a period of two weeks giving the following specific details:  a)  Whether any documents were uploaded on behalf of the Opponent in all four oppositions under Rule 45, and if so on which date and how many pages were there?  b)  Whether any documents were uploaded on behalf of the Opponent under Rule 47 in all four oppositions, and if so on which date and how many pages were there?  c)  Whether the evidence by way of affidavit of Mrs. Kalpana Umakanth running into 12 pages in all the four opposition proceedings was uploaded online on 5th August, 2019 or not and if so what is the proof thereof?  d)  Reason, if any, as to why the Certificate issued by Mr. Chandrakant S. Uchil, Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks & GI, Mumbai working as System Administrator describes the number of pages uploaded on 5th August, 2019 as being one page each and not the 12 pages which are annexed with the said Certificate.  e)  The provision of law under which purported  online filing on 5th August, 2019 has been considered by the Trade Marks Registry.•",

                        "content": "On the one hand, the stand of the Applicant is that there is a clear doubt as to whether the evidence was filed within time. Mr. Siddhant Goel, ld. Counsel for the Applicant submits that the evidence was not even served upon the Applicant. To support this contention, he makes the following  submissions:  (i)  Section 21(4) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter •Trademarks Act•) specifically provides that the evidence has to be filed in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time. The same should be read along with Rule 45 (1) of the TM Rules, to interpret the prescribed manner and time as 2 months, with service to the Applicant and Registry.  (ii)  Since the period for filing of the evidence is mandatory and is not condonable, the oppositions should be taken to have been abandoned. The same is the usual practice of the Trademark Registry, as per various orders in other matters.  (iii)  Vehement reliance is placed on Rule 112 of the TM Rules as per which if there is any detriment that would be caused to any party, the Registrar cannot exercise the discretion even to obviate the irregularities in any procedure.  (iv)  Rule 14 (3) of the TM Rules provides the manner in which service is to be effected and as per this provision, if the letter was put in post, it is sufficient. In this case, the evidence was put in post for being delivered to the Applicant only on 9th August, 2019, after the time of 2 months had expired. Thus, the deeming provision has to be triggered.  (v)  In fact, the portal of the IPO does not permit or accept online filing once the time for filing has expired and that explains why the physical filing was done by the Opponent.  (vi)  Reliance is placed upon Surinder Corporation v. Hindustan Level  Limited & Anr., 2007 (35) PTC 388 (Del), to submit that the  Registrar has no discretion to even condone the delay. Though, the said judgment was under the old Rule 50 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2002, wherein 2+1 (i.e., a maximum period of 3) months was the period for filing of evidence in support of oppositions, the ld. Single Judge had held clearly that there is no discretion of the Registrar to extend the period for filing the same.  (vii)  Since, there is no discretion vested in the Registrar to condone the delay, following similar provisions under the Patents Act, 1970, the delay cannot be condoned. Reliance is placed on Nippon Steel Corporation v. Union of India [W.P. (C) 801 of 2011, decided on 8th February 2011].",

However, in the present case, since Respondent No.1 itself submitted that the evidence was filed under Rule 45 on 5th August, 2019 and at best, there must have been some delay in the dispatch of the final documents which were received on 13th August, 2019, this is not a case where the evidence can be held to have not been filed under Rule 45. There is some doubt as to why the evidence were not served upon the Applicant initially, and some documents were finally served in hardcopy upon the Applicant only on 17th August, 2019, as per the Opponent•s affidavit. However, the doubt which has arisen here cannot result in a situation where the legal rights of the parties are prejudiced in a manner so as to render the oppositions themselves as having been abandoned.",

(supra) has held that a well-known trade mark is a mark which is widely known to the relevant general public and enjoys a comparatively high reputation amongst them. It further held that when a person uses another person‟s „well-known trade mark‟, he tries to take advantage of the goodwill that such a „well-known trade mark‟ enjoys. Such an act constitutes as unfair competition. It also causes dilution of a „well-known trade mark’ as it loses its ability to be unique and distinctively identified and distinguish as one source and consequent change in perception which reduces the market value or selling power of the product bearing the well-known mark. The Court further laid down the factors that a Court needs to consider for determining whether the trade mark is a „well-known trade mark‟ or not, as under:  “13. Trademarks Act, 1999 does not specify the factors which the Court needs to consider while determining whether a mark is a well known mark or not, though it does contain factors which the Registrar has to consider whether a trademark is a well known mark or not. In determining whether a trademark is a well known mark or not, the Court needs to consider a number of factors including (i) the extent of knowledge of the mark to, and its recognition by the relevant public; (ii) the duration of the use of the mark; (iii) the extent of the products and services in relation to which the mark is being used; (iv) the method, frequency, extent and duration of advertising and promotion of the mark; (v) the geographical extent of the trading area in  which the mark is used; (vi) the state of registration of the mark; (vii) the volume of business of the goods or services sold under that mark; (viii) the nature and extent of the use of same or similar mark by other parties; (ix) the extent to which the rights claimed in the mark have been successfully enforced, particularly before the Courts of law and trademark registry and (x) actual or potential number of persons consuming goods or availing services being sold under that brand. A trademark being well known in one country is not necessarily determinative of its being well known and famous in other countries, the controlling requirement being the reputation in the local jurisdiction.”",

The use of the same or similar domain name may lead to a diversion of users, which could result from such users mistakenly accessing one domain name instead of  another. Therefore, a domain name may have all the characteristics of a trade mark and could found an action for passing off. While registration of a domain name with such Domain Name Registrars may not have the same consequences as registration under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, nevertheless, it at least evidences recognised user of a mark. Referring to the Uniform Domain Name Disputes Resolution Policy, the Supreme Court observed that the said Rules grant protection to intellectual property in a domain name. A prior registrant can protect its domain name against the subsequent registrants. The confusing similarity in domain names may be a ground for complaint, and similarity is to be decided on the possibility of deception amongst potential customers. The defences available to a complaint are also substantially similar to those available to an action for passing off under trade mark law.",

The action for passing off is premised on the right of the prior user generating goodwill and shall remain unaffected by any registration provided under the Act. The mere fact that both the prior user and the subsequent user are registered proprietors is irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging the goodwill and reputation of the prior right holder/former user.

It is not permissible to draw any inference as to the user of the mark from its mere presence in the register of the Trade Mark. [Ref.: Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) 1 SCR 968]. In fact, in the present case, the application seeking registration of the trade mark by the defendants was filed with the declaration that the mark was proposed to be used. The defendants cannot wash away such a declaration by putting the blame on  their attorney. In terms of Rule 25 of the Trade Marks Rules, 2017, read with Note (d) to Clause 9 of TM-A, such declaration is final.",

Apart from the fact that it is similar to that of the plaintiff, the defendant no. 2 is an „internet marketing service‟ and, therefore, can be presumed to have knowledge of the existence of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has also produced on record the material to show that the websites of the defendants, namely, „SARKARIRESULT.INFO‟ and „SARKARIRESULTS.INFO‟, were available for sale. Though the defendants have filed documents to show their subsequent protest on such an offer of sale, which they claim to be unauthorised, at least prima facie, this would require them to lead evidence to prove that the same was, indeed, put up for sale unauthorisedly. The fact that the defendants are using the domain name, „SARKARIUPDATE.COM‟, is also relevant for deciding the relative balance of convenience between the parties and the honesty of adoption of the impugned domain names by the defendants. The same clearly tilts the balance in favour of the plaintiff. Where the adoption of the mark is itself dishonest, an injunction must follow. The subsequent user of a mark dishonestly adopted is equally tainted and totally immaterial. The party who has stolen the mark cannot claim the benefit of a concurrent user because the governing principle of concurrent user lies on account of honesty. [Ref.: Innovolt Inc. v.

The said affidavits having been given up, the same could not have been relied upon by the Opposition Board in its recommendation.  iii)  The second recommendation of the Opposition Board dated 16th February, 2022 is almost identical to the first recommendation which was earlier submitted on 21st August, 2019. A tabular chart is referred to establish this allegation. Thus, there has been gross non-application of mind by the Opposition Board in the second round.  iv)  That the representations, despite the orders passed by the Court, have not been properly decided by the Patent Office and this by itself would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.  v)  The two affidavits of Mr. John F. Carpenter and Ms. Dorthe Kot Engelund filed on behalf of the Patentee have not been  considered by the Opposition Board.  vi)  The recommendation of the Opposition Board dated 16th February, 2022 referred to an affidavit of Ravindra Agarwal dated 29th September, 2014 whereas no such affidavit has been filed on record.",

Rules 55A to 63 govern post-grant oppositions. Prior to the constitution of the Opposition Board under Rule 56, the following steps are to be followed:  i)  The Opponent has to file the written statement of opposition (`Opposition•) along with his evidence; ii)The Patentee, if it wishes to contest the opposition has to file the reply statement (`Patentee•s Reply•) along with its evidence within a period of two months after receiving the opponent•s opposition. If the patentee does not contest or file a reply/ evidence, the patent would be deemed to be revoked;  iii)  Upon the Patentee filing its reply statement, the opponent has the opportunity to file the reply evidence (hereinafter •Opponent•s Rejoinder•) within one month upon receiving the patentee•s reply. However, the said rejoinder would have to be strictly confined to the matters which have been raised in the patentee•s evidence. Thus, there is no permissibility for the opponent to expand the scope of the rejoinder beyond the reply filed by the Patentee;  iv)  The Opposition Board constituted under Rule 56 would then consider all the documents filed by the parties and submit a report along with its joint recommendation to the Controller.  Thus, the scheme of the Rules envisages that the Opposition Board ought to consider all the pleadings and documents prior to giving its recommendations. Further, the timelines which have been stipulated in the Rules also show that the same ought to be followed  strictly.

The Supreme Court in Cipla (supra) has held as under:  •The aforesaid provisions indicate that the Opposition Board has to conduct an examination of notice of opposition along with the documents filed under Rules 57 to 60 and then to submit a report with reasons on each ground taken in the notice of opposition. The Opposition Board has, therefore, to make recommendation with reasons after examining documents produced by the parties as per Rules.  Section 25 (4) of the Act says that on receipt of the recommendation of the Opposition Board and after giving the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard, the Controller shall order either to maintain or to amend or to revoke the patent. The  procedure to be followed by the Controller is provided in Rule 62 of the Rules, which reads as follows:•",

                        "content": "The Supreme Court has also considered the manner in which the powers of the Controller are to be exercised in post-grant opposition proceedings and has laid down as under:  •Sub-rule (1) of Rule 62 confers power on the Controller to require members of Opposition Board to be present in the hearing after receiving recommendation of the Opposition Board. The Controller, after hearing the parties if they so desire and after taking into consideration the recommendation of the Opposition Board, has to decide the opposition giving reasons. Provisions of the Act and the Rules, therefore, clearly indicate that the Opposition Board has to make its recommendations after considering the written statement of opposition, reply statement, evidence adduced, by the parties with reasons on each ground taken by the parties. Rule 62 also empowers the Controller to take into consideration the reasons stated by the Opposition Board in its Report. In other words, the Report of The Opposition Board has got considerable relevance while taking a decision by The Controller under Section 25 (4) of the Act read with Rule 62 (5) of the Rules.  The Opposition Board in a given case may make recommendation that the patent suffers from serious defects like lack of novelty, lack of inventive steps etc., so also it can recommend that the patent shall be granted since the invention has novelty, inventive steps etc. Such recommendations are made after examining the evidence adduced by the parties before it. Unless the parties are informed of the reasons, for making such recommendations they would not be able to effectively advance their respective contentions before the Controller. Section 25 (3) (b) read with Rule 56 (4)  cast no obligation on the Opposition Board to give a copy of the Report to either of the parties. So also no obligation is cast under Section 25(4) or under Rule 62 on the Controller to make available the report of the recommendation of the Opposition Board. But considering the fact that the Report of the Opposition Board can be crucial in the decision making process, while passing order by the Controller under Section 25 (4), principles of natural justice must be read into those provisions of the Report/recommendation of Opposition Board, therefore, should be made available to the parties before the Controller passes orders under Section 25(4) of the Act.•",

Since the Opposition Board is to be constituted of three members, there is no reason whatsoever as to why the names of members of the Opposition Board should either be masked or missing from the said recommendation. As is seen in the present case, the initial recommendation of the Opposition Board did not contain the names of the members constituting the Board. Their signatures were also not visible in the document. In the final recommendations which are on record, only the name of Chairperson of the Opposition Board has been mentioned. This would be completely nontransparent and would result in proceedings being filed and challenges being made to the recommendation. Moreover, in order to preserve the integrity of the recommendation of the Opposition Board, it is necessary to ensure that the names of the members constituting the Opposition Board are clearly reflected both on the cover page and on the final page where the members should append their signatures to the recommendation. It is, accordingly,  directed that henceforth the ld. Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks (CGPDTM) shall ensure that the names of the members constituting the Opposition Board are clearly mentioned on the cover page and the recommendations are duly signed by the members of the Opposition Board.",

The Court below had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, which was barred under the provisions of Rent Control Act and also in view of Section 19 of the Slum Areas Act, as the requisite permission mandated therein was admittedly not obtained by the respondent.  ii.  It was wrongly held that the suit premises were let out for residential purpose. The Trial Court has ignored the fact that the plan filed by the respondent as Ex. PW 1 / 2 did not reflect the premises to be residential in nature. The purpose of letting was also not specified in the rent note Ex. PW1/3 propounded by the respondent.  iii.  The Trial Court discarded the documents/evidence tendered by the appellants that unequivocally prove the existence of the firm M/s Mehlu Mal Laxman Dass at the suit premises, and that the said firm was registered and carried on business from the suit premises.  iv.  The appellants have inherited tenancy rights, and therefore were protected from eviction both under the Rent Control Act, and also under the provisions of Slum Areas Act.  v.  The respondent admittedly had been collecting the rent of the premises till 1998 and had also increased the rent. Therefore, the appellants could not be treated as tresspassers and as such, they could not be ordered to be evicted without the permission of the Competent Authority under the Slum Areas Act. In any case, the definition of „tenant‟ contained in the Rent Control Act could not be applied to the provisions of the Slum Areas Act.  vi.  The Court below ought to have held the suit barred by time, as Laxman Dass is alleged to have died in 1950 while Mehlu Mal died in 1957. Therefore, suit filed in 2008 was hopelessly barred by time.  vii.  The respondent had not proved her legal ownership to the property, and the gift deed allegedly executed by her husband in her favour in 2002, could not be said to be legally executed and proved, without proof of the title of the person making the alleged gift.",

Tenancy protected by statute is statutory tenancy, which is heritable in the absence of any succession law incorporated in the Act. Therefore, the tenancy of Mehlu Mal is heritable, and on his demise, the tenancy was inherited by the appellants and the daughter of Mehlu Mal, along with other heirs under the succession law.

However, no reason has been given as to why the rent collector was not examined.  iv)  It describes the accommodation as a balakhana.  v)  The writing on the counterfoil is by a third person, though it bears the signature of Mohd. Haroon. Such third person has not been examined.  vi)  The receipt number of Ex. PW-1/DX, which has been admitted starts with the letter „A‟, the initial of Amtul Malik. Ex.

Even if the suit property, rented out for residential  purpose, was being used for commercial purpose, the same would not change the nature of the tenancy in view of the settled law as noted by the Trial Court also, which I reproduce as under:  “14. In the same manner in Smt. Tressa Nair (supra), it has been held that the premises give for residential purposes but premises used for residential cum commercial purposes by tenant without the consent of the landlord, therefore, premises is used incidentally for commercial or other purposes, the tenancy was to be held for residential only. In Joginder Singh (supra) it has been held that no convincing evidence oral or documentary to prove the purpose of letting has been placed on record therefore, the purpose of tenancy is to be inferred from the circumstance, nature of premises, extent of accommodation, location and dominant use besides other relevant factors. In Jagmohan Singh Wadhera (supra), it has been observed that non mentioning of letting purpose in rent receipt cannot lead to conclude that letting was residential cum commercial and in the absence of any document as to when the alleged business was carried out, the dominant use for which the tenanted premises were used were held to be residential. In Kuldeep Baj (supra) it has been observed that if a premises is residential and dominant use by the tenant is residential and tenant begins using a portion of the premises for commercial use without consent of the landlord than purpose shall remain residential. In Smt. Satya Malhotra (supra), it has been observed that putting of sign board on premises for receiving business correspondence at the address does not make out the letting out purpose as composite and tenant residing in the premises therefore, purpose of letting is held to for residential purposes. In Salek Chand Jain (supra), it has been observed that the tenant had not produced any employees register, cash book or ledger or any other document usually kept for commercial activities and there is no evidence that any customer had ever visited the premises, therefore, in those circumstances letting purpose could not be termed as residential cum commercial for the nature of user. In Kisan  Lal (supra) it has been observed that, if a tenanted premises is house it means that letting out was for residing and house means a dwelling place, therefore, if tenant gives address of his house for commercial purpose or correspondence, then it cannot mean for commercial user. Mere increase or reduction of rent does not necessarily import creating of new tenancy as held in Goppu Lai vs. Thakur Ji in view of 1969 RCR 300.”",

The said plea was rejected by the Trial Court precisely on the ground that the tenancy is residential and as such, the amendment as referred to above shall come into play. The Trial Court in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the impugned Judgment, has held as under:  “20. It may be noted that suit property was rented out to Mr. Mehlumal and Laxman Dass as joint tenant in terms of rent note Ex. PW 1/ 3 and after the death of Laxman Dass, Mehlumal was occupying the suit property as tenant and not  in any other independent right to the suit property. The said tenancy was for residential purposes only at a monthly rent of Rs.45/-excluding property taxes for a fixed period of 11 months and after expiry of the fixed period of the lease, the tenants become statutory tenants as Sh. Laxman Dass had expired issueless in the year 1950 and by virtue of provision of Delhi Rent Control Act, which was amended with retrospective effect in 1976, the status of defendant Mehlumal was that of a statutory tenant and notwithstanding the expiry of the tenancy by afflux of time, the plaintiff/landlord could not proceed against Mehlumal being statutory tenant. Mehlumal and his family were living at KU-1, Vishakha Enclave, Pitam Pura, Delhi and the suit property is lying unused, unoccupied and locked for the last couple of years. None of the defendants or any of their family members are residing in the suit property as admitted by defendants. No suggestion has been given to PW-1 that defendants or Mehlumal were residing in the suit property. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that tenancy was created in favour of joint tenants Mehlumal and Laxman Dass and after the death of Laxman Dass the said tenancy devolved upon Mehlumal and after the expiry of the lease deed the said Mehlumal became statutory tenant. The plaintiff is landlady of the defendant as rent is admittedly paid to her predecessor in title i.e. Ms. Amtul malik, the mother-in-law of plaintiff. 21. From the above discussions, I am of the opinion that tenanted premises was rented out for residential purpose only. So far as, the ratio of Gian Devi (supra) is concerned, the same is to the effect that commercial tenancy is heritable by the legal representative of the statutory tenant and has no applicability to the facts of the present case.”",

His plea is that the Act of 1952 in terms of Section 13 renders protection to a tenant whose tenancy has expired by efflux of time or by termination of contract. Therefore, the tenancy of Mehlu Mal is heritable on his demise, and as such, the tenancy has been inherited by the appellants and the daughter of Mehlu Mal along with other heirs under succession law.",

                        "content": "At the outset, I may state that this submission of Mr. Thareja, though looks appealing on a first blush, but on a closer examination, I find no such plea was taken by the appellants before the Court below and even in this appeal. This plea was put forth for the first time, in the written submissions with no opportunity to the respondent to answer/contest the same. Even otherwise, this plea is contrary to his earlier submission wherein he  attempted to show that the tenancy being commercial in nature, is heritable. The said submission of Mr. Thareja was despite knowing the fact that under the Rent Control Act, the tenancy for residential purposes has limited heritability. In effect, his stand now is that the Rent Control Act is not applicable to the tenancy in question as the tenancy has been inherited on the demise of Mehlu Mal in 1957, i.e., before the Rent Control Act was enacted. This new plea raised for the first time in appeal, warrants no consideration, as the same cannot be decided without further investigation into the question of facts. This I say so, because the appellants have not substantiated/corroborated their claim that Mehlu Mal died in 1957, by way of any documentary evidence. Even the answer of DW-1 Litesh Jeswani to question No.31 in his Cross-Examination states that Mehlu Mal died in 1956, not in 1957 as contended by the counsel for the appellants before Trial Court and even this Court. No death certificate has been annexed/exhibited by the appellants, even after DW-1 claiming that there is an entry of Mehlu Mal‟s death with the pandits in Haridwar, which evidence is held to be credible evidence by the High Court of Lahore in the case of Balak Ram High School & Ors. v. Nanu Mal, AIR 1930 Lah 579, which was followed by this Court in the case of Mahesh Dhingra v. Kamla Dhingra and Ors., CS (OS) 325/1984. Per contra, PW-1, Mohd. Haroon has stated in his Examination-in-Chief that Mehlu Mal had died a couple of years prior to 2007. Needless to say, even this claim of the respondent has not been corroborated by any documentary evidence. As both the parties have failed to substantiate their respective claims, and in the absence of any other evidence, the year/time of death of Mehlu Mal remains a disputed fact. There is nothing on record for this Court to  conclusively find that Mehlu Mal had, in fact, died in 1957, before the commencement of the Rent Control Act. In view thereof, this Court does not deem it appropriate to go into the submissions of Mr. Thareja regarding the devolution of tenancy in favour of the heirs of Mehlu Mal by virtue of general law of succession before the commencement of the Rent Control Act. In support of this conclusion, I may refer to paragraph 7 of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Karpagathachi & Ors. v. Nagarathinathachi, AIR 1965 SC 1752 wherein the Supreme Court has held as under:  “7. The second contention of Mr Viswanatha Sastry must also be rejected. A partition may be effected orally. By an oral partition, the two widows could adjust their diverse rights in the entire estate, and as part of this arrangement, each could orally agree to relinquish her right of survivorship to the portion allotted to the other. In the trial court, the suit was tried on the footing that the partition was oral, and that the two partition lists were merely pieces of evidence of the oral partition, and no objection was raised with regard to their admissibility in evidence. In the High Court, the appellants raised the contention for the first time that the two partition lists were required to be registered. The point could not be decided without further investigation into questions of fact, and in the circumstances, the High Court rightly ruled that this new contention could not be raised for the first time in appeal. We think that the appellants ought not to be allowed to raise this new contention.”  (emphasis supplied)",

Mr. Narula submits that tenant contemplated by Section 19 is a person in occupation or a person likely to be evicted, if permission is granted to institute eviction proceedings or execute an order of eviction. We do not agree. The protection contemplated is for a tenant is recognized by law. A mere occupier cannot be equated to a tenant. An occupier may be a trespasser or a licensee or a tenant. The concept of welfare state cannot extent to giving protection to the trespassers or person who have no right of occupation. Therefore, when the  Legislature used the term 'tenant' in Section 19 as well as Harish Chander Malik Vs. Vivek Kumar Gupta (G.S.Sistani.J.).\"",

Essentially and in a nutshell, the case set up by the Defendants is that pursuant to and in furtherance of MoU-2 dated 26.06.1995, the ‘Centre’ was constituted as a Trust with six lifetime Trustees, divided into two groups. MoU-2 regulated the manner of granting licenses for use of the trademark RATHI. ‘Centre’ has a separate registration for the said trademark and is entitled to its exclusive use. There is no family settlement or an overarching agreement between the ‘Centre’ and the ‘Foundation’ authorising or permitting the members of the ‘Foundation’ to regulate the use and licensing of the mark RATHI by the ‘Centre’. A new Trust Deed dated 06.11.2020 has been executed by the ‘Centre’, incorporating Clause (n) which permits grant of license for use of the trademark RATHI to other companies/firms/persons, not owned by the Members/Trustees whose names appear in the MoU-2 dated 26.06.1995, provided the grant is by a unanimous Resolution, in writing, by all six Trustees of the ‘Centre’ and signatories of the MoU-2. Pursuant thereto, Defendants have been assigned the user licenses to lawfully use the trademark RATHI for specified periods mentioned in the Agreements and limited to the products provided therein and subject to geographical restrictions.

It is further averred that the issue of validity of Clauses of the new Trust Deed dated 06.11.2020, including Clause 3(n), as well as the validity of the Trademark Assignment Agreements, entered into between the ‘Centre’ and the Defendants, cannot be settled without making Members/Trustees of the ‘Centre’ as parties to the suit. It is pleaded that in order to effectively adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the present suit, Members/Trustees of the ‘Centre’ are ‘necessary parties’ and the Members of the ‘Centre’ as referred to in para 9 of the application be impleaded, in the interest of justice. Relevant paras of the application are as under:- “7. Due to such disclosure of facts and circumstances by the Defendants, which the Plaintiff was not earlier aware of, it is imperative that the members/trustees of the Rathi Research Centre may be made a party to the present suit. It is the claim of the Plaintiff that the clause ‘3(n)’ of the new trust deed and the trade mark agreements with the Defendants to use the trade mark RATHI are contrary to the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding of the Rathi Research Centre and as such amounts to misuse of the trade mark RATHI. Since the Plaintiff’s trust is also the proprietor of the trade mark RATHI and the Plaintiff also has a vested interest in the same, the misuse of the trade mark RATHI will also impact the rights of the Plaintiff and the other trustees/beneficiaries.",

These are as under:  “(1) If, for the adjudication of the “real controversy” between the parties on record, the presence of a third party is necessary, then he can be impleaded;  (2)  It is imperative to note that by such impleading of the proposed party, all controversies arising in the suit and all issues arising thereunder may be finally determined and set at rest, thereby avoiding multiplicity of suits over a subject-matter which could still have been decided in the pending suit itself;  (3)  The proposed party must have a defined, subsisting, direct and substantive interest in the litigation which interest is either legal or equitable and which right is cognisable in law;  (4)  Meticulous care should be taken to avoid the adding of a party when the addition is intended merely as a ruse to ventilate certain other grievances of one or the other of the parties on record which is neither necessary or expedient to be considered by the Court in the pending litigation; and  (5)  It should always be remembered that considerable prejudice would be caused to the opposite party when irrelevant matters are allowed to be considered by Courts by adding a new party whose interest has no nexus to the subject-matter of the suit.”",

Both the petitioners are politicians of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (hereinafter “CPI(M)”). As per the contents of the petition, Petitioner No. 1 is a member of the Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) and a former Member of Parliament. Petitioner No. 2 is a member of the Central Committee of the CPI(M), in addition to being the Secretary of Delhi State Committee of CPI(M).  b.  It is the petitioners’ case that on 27th January 2020, Mr. Anurag Thakur, a Union Minister and Member of Parliament, allegedly made a hate speech at a rally in Rithala shouting the slogan “desh ke gaddaron ko'' and exhorting the crowd to respond with “goli maaron saalon ko”.  c.  It is further alleged that on 28th January 2020, Mr. Parvesh Verma, Member of Parliament from West Delhi Lok Sabha Constituency, made inflammatory hate speeches while campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (hereinafter “BJP”). Allegations are also levelled against him qua his interview to ANI, wherein he is stated to have threatened use of force to remove protestors at Shaheen Bagh and promoting hatred and enmity by portraying them as invaders.  d.  As per the petition, the petitioners on 29th January 2020 made a complaint against Mr. Anurag Thakur and Mr. Parvesh Verma to the Commissioner of Police, Delhi asking for registration of FIR against the two alleging them of having committed serious cognizable offences of inciting communal enmity, extending threats and making statements prejudicial to national integration.  e.  In furtherance of the said complaint, on 31st January 2020, another letter was addressed to the Commissioner stating therein that because of inaction of police over  their complaint has led to an incident wherein, according to the letter, an armed man shot at protesting students. In this second letter the petitioners again urged the Commissioner to take immediate action, file FIRs and take preventive steps against Hindu Sena.  f.  On 2nd February 2020, the petitioners, by way of a letter addressed to the SHO, Parliament Street Police Station, New Delhi, made a request to immediately file FIRs against Mr. Anurag Thakur and Mr. Parvesh Verma, enclosing therein the two aforementioned representations made earlier to the Commissioner.  g.  Subsequently, on 5th February 2020, the Petitioners filed an Application under Section 156(3) of Code seeking registration of FIR before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (I), Rouse Avenue Courts, Delhi, which was registered as Ct. Case No.04/2020. The Application, inter alia, sought for registration of FIR against the accused persons for offences under Sections 153A/153B/295A/298/504/505/506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  h.  ATR was called from the DCP District New Delhi. Subsequently, as per the record of the proceedings of the Court below, on 11th February 2020, ATR was filed by the Special Investigation Unit of Crime Branch and was taken on record. On the said date, the Crime Branch was  directed to expedite the preliminary inquiry and file the detailed ATR in next 15 days.  i.  In the proceedings dated 26th February 2020, the status report was filed by the investigating agency, wherein it was recorded that on the basis of allegations levelled in the complaint, prima facie no cognizable offence was found to be committed. The Copy of the Status Report was supplied to the other side and arguments were heard. The matter was posted for orders on 2nd March 2020.  j.  On 2nd March 2020, the Court of ACMM-I was informed that a WP (CRL) 565/2020 titled as “Harsh Mander and Another v. GNCTD and Others” was pending before this High Court containing the same averments and seeking the same relief as was being made in the petitioners’ application. In view of the fact that the High Court was already seized of the matter and had listed the matter for 13th April 2020 giving the opportunity to the Union of India for filing its response, the ACMM chose not to pass any order in the application till the outcome of the said writ petition.  k.  On 26th August 2020, the ACMM dismissed the Petitioners’ Application under Section 156(3) of the Code, recording the finding that the application was not tenable in the eyes of law on the ground that there was no previous sanction obtained by the  complainants/petitioners from the competent authority to prosecute the named individuals for the offences alleged in the complaint.  l.  Aggrieved by the said Order, the petitioners have approached this Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India read with Sections 482/483 of the Code praying inter alia for setting aside of the impugned Order.",

Ashok Kumar Aggarwal (2014) 14 SCC 295. The following extract is indicative of the burden that would be placed on a member of the general public prior to sending a request for sanction:  “8. In view of the above, the legal propositions can be summarised as under:  (a)  The prosecution must send the entire relevant record to the sanctioning authority including the FIR, disclosure statements, statements of witnesses, recovery memos, draft charge sheet and all other relevant material. The record so sent should also contain the material/document, if any, which may tilt the balance in favour of the accused and on the basis of which, the competent authority may refuse sanction.  (b)  The authority itself has to do complete and conscious scrutiny of the whole record so produced by the prosecution independently applying its mind and taking into consideration all the relevant facts before grant of sanction while discharging its duty to give or withhold the sanction.  (c)  The power to grant sanction is to be exercised strictly keeping in mind the public interest and the protection available to the accused against whom the sanction is sought. The order of sanction should make it evident that the authority had been aware of all relevant facts/materials and had applied its mind to all the relevant material.  (d)  In every individual case, the prosecution has to establish and satisfy the court by leading evidence that the entire relevant facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority and the authority had applied its mind on the same and that the sanction had been granted in accordance with law.”",

A bare reading of Anil Kumar & Ors. v. M.K. Aiyappa & Anr. (2013) 10 SCC 705, and of Manju Surana v. Sunil Arora, (2018) 5 SCC 557, would indicate that the requirement of prior sanction even at the stage of adjudication of an Application under Section 156 (3) of the Code, was in  order to prevent vexing public servants. The following extracts indicate the same:  “13. …We find it difficult to accept that contention. Subsection (3) of Section 19 has an object to achieve, which applies in circumstances where a Special Judge has already rendered a finding, sentence or order. In such an event, it shall not be reversed or altered by a court in appeal, confirmation or revision on the ground of absence of sanction. That does not mean that the requirement to obtain sanction is not a mandatory requirement. Once it is noticed that there was no previous sanction, as already indicated in various judgments referred to hereinabove, the Magistrate cannot order investigation against a public servant while invoking powers under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C.”  “… Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General sought to canvas the view taken in the last two judgments referred to aforesaid to submit that application of mind was necessary to exercise power under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C. and that credibility of information was to be weighed before ordering investigation (Ramdev Food Products (P) Ltd. v. State of Gujarat). It was, thus, submitted that allegation against a public servant under the P.C. Act offences are technical in nature and would require a higher evaluation standard and thus the Magistrates ought to apply their mind before ordering investigation against public servant. The consequences of starting investigation under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C., it was submitted, would result in the police registering an FIR (Suresh Chand Jain v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Mohd. Yousuf v. Afaq Jahan). Thus, a situation may arise where a Magistrate may exercise his power under Section 156(3) of the  Cr.P.C. in a routine manner resulting in an FIR being registered against a public servant, who may have no role in the allegation made.”",

Raju (2006) 6 SCC 728 that application of mind for ordering an investigation under Section 156(3) would not amount to taking cognizance. The judgment in Pastor P. Raju (supra) in fact holds as under:  “A plain reading of this provision will show that no Court can take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 153-B or sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of Section 505 of Indian Penal Code or a criminal conspiracy to commit such offence except with the previous sanction of the Central Government or of the State Government or of the District Magistrate.

There is no bar against registration of a criminal case or investigation by the police agency or submission of a report by the police on completion of investigation, as contemplated by Section 173 Cr.P.C. If a criminal case is registered, investigation of the offence is done and the police submits a report as a result of such investigation before a Magistrate without the previous sanction of the Central Government or of the State Government or of the District Magistrate, there will be no violation of Section 196(1-A) Cr.P.C. and no illegality of any kind would be committed.”",

But it is important to understand that such discussions are not a routine aspect of deciding cases in the law of negligence, and are unnecessary when existing principles provide a clear basis for the decision, as in the present appeal. I would not agree with Lord Hughes’s statement that they are the ultimate reason why there is no duty of care towards victims, suspects or witnesses imposed on police  officers engaged in the investigation and prevention of crime. The absence of a duty towards victims of crime, for example, does not depend merely on a policy devised by a recent generation of judges in relation to policing: it is based on the application of a general and long-established principle that the common law imposes no liability to protect persons against harm caused by third parties, in the absence of a recognised exception such as a voluntary assumption of responsibility.[ ...]  (4)  The distinction between careless acts causing personal injury, for which the law generally imposes liability, and careless omissions to prevent acts (by other agencies) causing personal injury, for which the common law generally imposes no liability, is not a mere alternative to policy-based reasoning, but is inherent in the nature of the tort of negligence. For the same reason, although the distinction, like any other distinction, can be difficult to draw in borderline cases, it is of fundamental importance. The central point is that the law of negligence generally imposes duties not to cause harm to other people or their property: it does not generally impose duties to provide them with benefits (including the prevention of harm caused by other agencies). Duties to provide benefits are, in general, voluntarily undertaken rather than being imposed by the common law, and are typically within the domain of contract, promises and trusts rather than tort. It follows from that basic characteristic of the law of negligence that liability is generally imposed for causing harm rather than for failing to prevent harm caused by other people or by natural causes. It is also consistent with that characteristic that the exceptions to the general non-imposition of liability for omissions include situations where there has been a voluntary assumption of responsibility to prevent harm (situations which have sometimes been described as being close or akin to contract), situations where a person has assumed a status which carries with it a responsibility to prevent harm, such as being a parent or standing in loco parentis, and situations where the omission arises in the context of the defendant’s having acted so as to create or increase a risk of harm”.",

Whatcott 2013 SCC 11, succeeded in bringing out the “human rights” obligations leading to control on publication of “hate speeches” for protection of human rights defining the expression “hate speech” observing that the definition of “hatred” set out in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, (1990) 3 SCR 892, with some modifications, provides a workable approach to interpreting the word “hatred” as is used in legislative provisions prohibiting hate speech. Three main prescriptions must be followed. First, courts must apply the hate speech prohibition objectively. The question courts must ask is whether a reasonable person, aware of the context and circumstances, would view the expression as exposing the protected group to hatred. Second, the legislative term “hatred” or “hatred or contempt” must be interpreted as being restricted to those extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words “detestation” and “vilification”. This filters out expression which, while repugnant and offensive, does not incite the level of abhorrence, delegitimization and rejection that risks causing discrimination or other harmful effects. Third, the Courts must focus their analysis on the effect of the expression at issue, namely – whether it is likely to expose the targeted person or group to hatred by others. The repugnancy of the ideas being expressed is not sufficient to justify restricting the expression, and whether or not the author of the expression intended to incite hatred or discriminatory treatment is irrelevant. The key is to determine the likely effect of the expression on its audience, keeping in mind the legislative objectives to reduce or eliminate discrimination.",

It was held as under:  “8. Hate speech is an effort to marginalise individuals based on their membership in a group. Using expression that exposes the group to hatred, hate speech seeks to delegitimise group members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing and acceptance within society. Hate speech, therefore, rises beyond causing distress to individual group members. It can have a societal impact. Hate speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on 26 vulnerable sections that can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide. Hate speech also impacts a protected group’s ability to respond to the substantive idea under debate, thereby placing a serious barrier to their full participation in our democracy.”",

Once it has been established that there has been an interference with freedom of expression, the courts resort to a three-fold analysis to determine the legitimacy of such interference:  (a)  Is the interference prescribed by law? The law that allows limitation of article 10 of ECHR must be prescribed by the statute and must be precise so that the citizens can regulate their conduct in accordance with the law and foresee the consequences of the impermissible conduct.  (b)  Is the interference proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued? It has been opined by the court in Handyside v. United Kingdom,49 that the restrictions imposed by the State under article 10(2) on freedom of expression must be ‘proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.’  (c)  Is the interference necessary in a democratic society? This test requires a careful examination of the fact to determine whether the freedom was limited in pursuance of a legitimate social need and in order to protect the principles and values underlying ECHR.

Paras Nath Singh [(2009) 6 SCC 372 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 200] , and this Court expressed the following view: (SCC pp. 375, para 6)  “6. … ‘10. … And the jurisdiction of a Magistrate to take cognizance of any offence is provided by Section 190 of the Code, either on receipt of a complaint, or upon a police report or upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his knowledge that such offence has been committed. So far as public servants are concerned, the cognizance of any offence, by any court, is barred by Section 197 of the Code unless sanction is obtained from the appropriate authority, if the offence, alleged to have been committed, was in discharge of the official duty. The section not only specifies the persons to whom the protection is afforded but it also specifies the conditions and circumstances in which it shall be available and the effect in law if the conditions are satisfied. The mandatory character of the protection afforded to a public servant is brought out by the expression, ‘no court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction’. Use of the  words ‘no’ and ‘shall’ makes it abundantly clear that the bar on the exercise of power of the court to take cognizance of any offence is absolute and complete. The very cognizance is barred. That is, the complaint cannot be taken notice of. According to Black's Law Dictionary the word ‘cognizance’ means ‘jurisdiction’ or ‘the exercise of jurisdiction’ or ‘power to try and determine causes’. In common parlance, it means taking notice of. A court, therefore, is precluded from entertaining a complaint or taking notice of it or exercising jurisdiction if it is in respect of a public servant who is accused of an offence alleged to have been committed during discharge of his official duty.’ [Ed.: As observed in State of H.P. v.

What is relevant for our purposes is that this section bars taking cognizance of an offence.

State of Karnataka, 2014 SCC OnLine Kar 12287], that bar is from taking cognizance which would not apply at the stage of investigation by the investigating officer.

State of Himachal Pradesh 2021 SCC OnLine SC 334, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated and summarized the principles governing the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court in the presence of an alternate remedy. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed:  “28. The principles of law which emerge are that:  (i)  The power under Article 226 of the Constitution to issue writs can be exercised not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but for any other purpose as well;  (ii)  The High Court has the discretion not to entertain a writ petition. One of the restrictions placed on the power of the High Court is where an effective alternate remedy is available to the aggrieved person;  (iii)  Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of a fundamental right protected by Part III of the Constitution; (b) there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice; (c) the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction; or (d) the vires of a legislation is challenged;  (iv)  An alternate remedy by itself does not divest the High Court of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in an appropriate case though ordinarily,  a writ petition should not be entertained when an efficacious alternate remedy is provided by law;  (v)  When a right is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had to that particular statutory remedy before invoking the discretionary remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience and discretion; and  (vi)  In cases where there are disputed questions of fact, the High Court may decide to decline jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the High Court is objectively of the view that the nature of the controversy requires the exercise of its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily be interfered with.”",

Thus, it does not amount to commission of any cognizable offence as alleged by the complainants.  b.  Qua the allegations regarding Mr. Verma, it is stated that the speaker has only stated his position on the erstwhile protest ongoing in Shaheen Bagh, and not any specific community or its members. It is further recorded by the agency that no provocation whatsoever has been made instigating the crowd to riot or for taking any retaliatory action against the protestors.  c.  Regarding other allegations of incidents of violence being inspired by the speeches of the two leaders, it has been recorded in the Status Report that first, separate FIRs had been lodged against the accused in those cases, second, the cases had been referred to Crime Branch for further investigation, third, none of the accused as alleged of having committed the acts of violence had attributed their actions to either of the speeches made, and fourth, there was no connection whatsoever to the speeches in question and the acts of violence.  In light of the aforesaid, it has been recorded in the Status Report that on the basis of allegation levelled in the complaint, prima facie no cognizable offence has been found to be committed.",

It was held as under: - “The subsequent judgment in Manju Surana (supra) case has referred the issue to a Larger Bench but did not declare the ratio laid down in the earlier two judgments as either per incuriam or a bad law. To that extent the submission of the learned Advocate General that an issue which could not be decided subsequently by the Hon’ble Supreme Court cannot be decided by a High Court on the mere asking of the petitioner, cannot be brushed aside. The submission of the learned Advocate General that in case a reference has been made on a point of law then the last of the judgment which is authority on the point would be valid is the correct proposition to be followed by this Court, as was held in M.S. Bhati Vs. National Insurance Company Ltd., (2019) 12 SCC 248; P. Sudhakar Rao & Ors. Vs U. Govinda Rao & Ors. (2013) 8 SCC 693; Ashoke Sadarangani & Anr. Vs.

Having regard to the subject matter by way of which the petitioner has attempt to invoke the provisions of Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure against the public servants this Court is of the opinion that as the provision of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been incorporated in the statute, the same has been for a meaningful purpose of allowing the public servants to discharge their duties without fear or favour or without any anticipation of being harassed because of the rigors of law. Therefore, ordinarily a valid sanction would be required in a proceeding where the provisions of Section 156(3) Cr. P.C. are invoked against public servants. However, in this case substantive offences as alleged have not been made out, so the issue of sanction is an additional consideration.”",

I have studied B.Com (Hons.) from Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, University of Delhi. Since 1988, I have been engaged in automobile parts business but due to losses I have closed it down. I used to have some automobile parts and electronics business in relation to which I frequently travelled to China.  I have filed a total of 416 trademark applications. I was told by some lawyers that if I register these marks I could do business using them on products from China. The lawyers who gave me this advice are Mr. Anand Shanker Gupta and Mr. Bansal. The said lawyers came to my office. I started filing these trade mark applications in 2015. Several of these marks have been registered by the Trademark Registry. One of the brands registered by me called •Green Fire Off• was sold by me to one Mr. Sandeep Sharma. I was paid Rs.5,00,000/-plus GST as consideration. I have spent more than Rs.20,00,000/-in filing these trade mark applications.  I have not used any of the brands for which I have applied. I was under legal advice that if I register these  marks, I will be entitled to use them and, therefore, I applied for these marks. I am willing to withdraw all the trademark applications which I have filed except those which are not violating any third party rights. I was earlier the owner of the property located at 13/78, West Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi -110026. This property has now been sold by me as of March, 2022 due to losses. I undertake not to adopt/apply for registration of any third party trademarks, including the mark •OSRAM• and •HENGST•, in future or use the same for business.

I have also studied B.Com (Hons.). We had an automobile parts business in which we also manufactured coolants, filters, etc. The said business has been closed with effect from 31st March, 2022. I was contacted by the Plaintiff•s representatives and I entered into negotiations with them. Both my father and myself met the representative of the Plaintiff. When the Plaintiff contacted us, we did not agree to give up the mark •OSRAM• as we were under legal advice. However, now we have taken a decision to withdraw the applications and give up the mark. In April and May 2022, we have already withdrawn the trademark applications for the mark •OSRAM•. We have never used the said mark. I undertake not to adopt/apply for registration of any third party trademarks, including the mark •OSRAM• and •HENGST•, in future or use the same for business.•",

This position has been upheld by various decisions such as:  (i) Kirloskar (supra);  (ii)  Fine Footwear (supra);  (iii)  Bharat Bhogilal (supra);  (iv)  Neelkanth Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. v. Neelkanth Healthchem, AIR 2018 Raj 67, AIR 2018 Raj 67; and  (v)  Ambala Sarabhai Enterprises Limited v. K S Infraspace LLP and Anr., 2020 (15) SCC 585.  •  While, initially, prescribing the ‘specified value’ of commercial suits at Rs.1 crore, and thereafter, reducing the same to Rs.3,00,000/-vide the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Act, 2018 (hereinafter “2018 Amendment”), the Legislature was conscious of the value of the dispute and, thus, the same cannot be ignored.  •  Reliance is placed upon Section 134 of the Trademarks Act and provisions of the CCA to submit that the provisions of the two statutes ought to be harmoniously construed to arrive at the forum which will have jurisdiction in such matters. Thus, the definition of ‘specified value’ cannot be ignored.  •  In this endeavor, the Court ought to examine the question as to whether a particular suit has been valued arbitrarily. The Delhi High Court has clearly held in Subhashini Malik v. S.K. Gandhi & Ors., (2016) 233 DLT 83, that the plaintiff being the dominus litis has a choice to choose the forum and remedy. However, the valuation of the IPR suits below Rs.3 lakhs, has led to a situation where the plaintiff is not only exercising the right to choose the Court before which the matter would be listed, but is also avoiding the rigors of the substantial provisions of the CCA. According to Ms. Sukumar, the  CCA is not merely a procedural law as various substantial provisions may affect the manner in which ‘commercial disputes’ are adjudicated.  •  This raises the issue of two competing factors: (i) the twin test of pecuniary and subject matter jurisdiction that has to be satisfied by a suit for applicability of CCA; and (ii) public policy considerations which prohibit forum-shopping and habitual undervaluation of suits.  •  Notably, the repercussions of undervaluation of suits are high and it would defeat the very purpose of the CCA. Thus, the Court ought to lift the veil on the valuation made by plaintiff in such matters and the plaintiff’s right is not unfettered.  •  In light of the above, it is clear that the valuation ought not to be whimsical or arbitrary and if it is, then the Court ought to intervene.  •  Ms. Sukumar, places reliance on the following decisions to support her submissions that the Court is entitled to examine the valuation and the manner in which it may do so:  (i)  Meenakshisundaram Chettiar v. Venkatachalam Chettiar, (1980) 1 SCC 616;  (ii)  Abdul Hamid Shamsi v. Abdul Majid, (1988) 2 SCC 575;  (iii)  Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. All India Bharat Sanchar Nigam Executives’ Association (Regd.) & Ors. (2006) 130 DLT 195; and  (iv)  Lalit Babbar v. Ramson Prime Technologies Pvt. Ltd., [CS(Comm.) 1857/2020, decided on 23rd December, 2020].  •  The guidance for estimating the value of the suit, may be drawn from the CCA. Under Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA, where the relief sought  in a suit, appeal or application relates to any intangible right, the market value of the intangible right is to be looked at. Thus, the valuation of a suit in intellectual property matters can be made more stringent, by requiring the plaintiff to furnish information on the market value of the right.  •  Further, in the case of trademarks, by a mere assessment of the period for which the brand has been used, the Court can assess the market value of the intangible right. Similarly, royalty rates may be required to be disclosed along with total expected royalty amount.",

There is no repugnancy between the provisions of the IPR statutes and the CCA.  •  However, since in Delhi the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Courts is Rs.3 lakhs and above, and the same also matches with the ‘specified value’ for the ‘commercial disputes’ at the District Court level, the IPR disputes which have to anyway be listed only before the District Judges, may be placed before the District Judge (Commercial). This is in view of the fact that under Article 236 of the Constitution, the District Judge includes the Judge of a City Civil Court, ADJ, etc. Thus, both the ADJ (non-Commercial) and ADJ  (Commercial), would constitute the District Court. Further, as held in  Kesavarapu Venkateswarlu & Ors. v. Sardharala Satanaryana & Ors., AIR 1957 AP 49, a Superior Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of a dispute maintainable before an Inferior Court, as the Superior Court would not lack inherent jurisdiction, as long as it has subject-matter jurisdiction.  •  Consequently, both District Judges – Commercial and non-Commercial – have subject matter jurisdiction over IPR disputes, but neither has the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction as the pecuniary jurisdiction of District Courts, even for ordinary civil suits, starts at Rs. 3 lakhs.  •  Therefore, since ADJs have to hear IPR matters irrespective of their value, administratively, the matters can be listed before the ADJs holding Commercial Courts.  •  He underscores his submissions with the caveat that Delhi stands in a peculiar position to use this interpretation, in as much as in case of IPR suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, there are no District Judges/ADJs who have the pecuniary jurisdiction to hear the same.",

Therefore, it would not oust the jurisdiction of higher Courts (such as Commercial Courts), which have substantive jurisdiction over the subject matter.  •  In view of this legal position, Mr. Chopra, ld. Counsel, emphasizes, the fact that in IPR cases, the policy decision of the Legislature is to have the same adjudicated upon by the District Courts, irrespective of a lower pecuniary value. To support this contention, Mr. Chopra relies upon the various notifications and provisions of the IPR statutes. According to him, pecuniary value of an IPR suit is irrelevant.  •  Reliance is also placed upon Dashrath B. Rathod v. Fox Star Studios India Pvt. Ltd. (2017 SCC OnLine Bom 345), where the Bombay High Court has clearly held that monetary value is inconsequential in an IPR dispute.  •  An analogy is drawn with arbitration cases relying upon Rahisuddin v. Gambit Leasing & Finance Pvt. Ltd., 2011 (176) DLT 696, where the Court held that a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ought to be filed before a Court not inferior to  a District Court in terms of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act.  •  He also points out that in most IPR statutes like patents/designs, when a cancellation/revocation of patent/design is sought, the matters are automatically listed before the High Court irrespective of pecuniary valuation.1  •  Further, in so far as the ‘specified value’ under the CCA is concerned, the important features of the provisions of the CCA have been considered by the Supreme Court in Ambalal Sarabhai (supra). He seeks to distinguish the decision in Soni Dave (supra) by arguing that the said judgment was in the context of immovable properties not used in trade or commerce. Since not all categories of immovable properties constitute ‘commercial disputes’, the Court had to adjudicate as to which kind of cases would be construed as ‘commercial disputes’. The said decision would not be applicable in case of IPR disputes.  •  In Super Cassettes Industries Pvt. Ltd. M/s Goldy Industries Pvt. Ltd. [CS(COMM) 775/2016, decided on 17th August, 2016], the Court was merely interpreting the first proviso to Section 7 of the CCA as to whether suits, which are valued below the ‘specified value’, ought to be permitted to be filed in the High Court or not. At the time of the said case, the 2018 Amendment reducing the pecuniary value of the ‘commercial disputes’ from Rs.1 crore to Rs.3 lakhs was yet to be introduced. Therefore, the Super Cassettes (supra) decision would be inapplicable in adjudicating the issue currently being  decided by the Court.  •  Allowing an interpretation contrary to the above submissions, and the manner in which IPR suits are now sought to be adjudicated in two parallel streams, one under the CCA and one under the CPC, would be improper and contrary to the intention behind the enactment of the CCA. The plaintiff ought not to be permitted to escape the rigorous of the CCA by merely valuing the suit at less than Rs.3 lakhs in an arbitrary and whimsical manner.  •  Therefore, though the plaintiff has the right to value a suit in terms of the Full Bench decision in Subhashini Malik (supra), since IPR litigation is treated as a separate class of litigation, the plaintiff ought not to be permitted to escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA simply due to valuation of the suit being below Rs. 3 lakhs.  •  Reliance is placed upon the order passed by the Commercial Court in Delhi in Lalit Babbar (supra) which held that the provisions of the CCA have to be read harmoniously with the Court Fees Act, 1870 (hereinafter “Court Fees Act”) and the Suits Valuation Act, 1887 (hereinafter “Suits Valuation Act”).",

Vimani Pannalal, (1988) SCC 423, to argue that the plaintiff has the freedom to make a reasonable assessment and value the suit, but the same cannot be arbitrary.  •  In Kalla Yadagiri v. Kotha Bal Reddy, (1999) 1 ALD 222 (FB), the Andhra Pradesh High Court has held that the value of the subject matter of the suit would be the value of the relief claimed. The said decision reads as under:  “25. As noted above, clause (i) of Section 2 of the Act defines “Specified Value”, in relation to a commercial dispute, shall mean the value of the subject matter in respect of a suit as determined in accordance with section 12 [which shall not be less than three lakh rupees] or such higher value, as may be notified by the Central Government”.

Thus, such suits would should automatically be filed and listed before the Commercial Courts.  •  In any event, the question of ‘specified value’ ought not to be given so much importance so as to control the jurisdiction of the Commercial Courts itself. A mischief ought not to be allowed by having two sets of jurisdictions under two separate substantive provisions, basis pecuniary value. Accordingly, IPR statues and CCA provisions have to be harmoniously construed. In this regard, Section 21 of the CCA has an overriding effect and therefore, the objective of speedy resolution of disputes is to be given importance.  •  Finally, even if Commercial Courts do not have jurisdiction over an IPR dispute with a ‘specified value’ of less than Rs.3 lakhs, in V Ramamirtham v. Rama Film Service, AIR 1951 Mad 93, it has been held that while a Court does not have a jurisdiction to try a suit valued above its maximum pecuniary jurisdiction, the converse may not be true.

Such procedures are case management hearings, truncated trials, summary judgments, etc. The following, as submitted by Mr. Dushyant K. Mahant, ld. Counsel, is an illustration of the difference in the provisions between the CPC and CCA, which is to enable the speeder disposal of ‘commercial disputes’:  (ii)  Thus, litigants in civil suits being ‘commercial disputes’ but not of ‘specified value’, are not governed by the CCA, and would not be able to take the benefit of the unique procedures provided in the CCA. This of course, in effect, has a negative  impact on the speedy adjudication of IPR disputes themselves.  (iii)  Even in the Statement of Object and Reasons, as cited by Ms. Sukumar, ld. Amicus, the purpose behind the 2018 Amendment is borne out as under:  “2. The global economic environment has since become increasingly competitive and to attract business at international level, India needs to further improve its ranking in the World Bank 'Doing Business Report' which, inter alia, considers the dispute resolution environment in the country as one of the parameters for doing business. Further, the tremendous economic development has ushered in enormous commercial activities in the country including foreign direct investments, public private partnership, etc., which has prompted initiating legislative measures for speedy settlement of commercial disputes, widen the scope of the courts to deal with commercial disputes and facilitate ease of doing business. Needless to say that early resolution of commercial disputes of even lesser value creates a positive image amongst the investors about the strong and responsive Indian legal system. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015.  xxx xxx xxx",

I also find merit in the contention that the provisions of the Commercial Courts Act and the Court Fees Act should be interpreted harmoniously. Section 27 of the Court Fees Act deals with suits for injunction. As per Section 27(c), where the subject matter of the  suit has a market value or not, fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint or on Rs.500/-whichever is higher. The relief in the instant suit is for a decree of mandatory injunction directing the defendant to quit from the building described in plaint A and B schedules with damages for loss of user and occupation at the rate of Rs.10,42,125.00 per month from the date of suit till delivery of possession and the petitioner has paid court fees under Section 27(c). In a suit for injunction simplicitor, it is the value of the relief claimed and not the value of the property involved that determines the jurisdiction. \"Subject matter\" is the substance for adjudication and has reference to the right which the plaintiff seeks to enforce and the valuation of the suit depends upon the value of the subject matter. Similar question was considered by the High Court of Delhi in Mrs.Soni Dave (supra). After careful scrutiny of Section 12 of the Act and the relevant provision of the Court Fees Act, it was held as follows;  \"27. In my view Section 12 of the Commercial Courts Act providing for determination of specified value as defined in Section 2(i) thereof is not intended to provide for a new mode zof determining the valuation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction and court fees.

The twin requirements of this Act are that a dispute has to be a commercial dispute, and secondly, it must be of certain pecuniary limit, namely Rs.3,00,000/-or above. The term commercial dispute has been defined in Section 2(c) of the Act. Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) clearly deals with the intellectual property rights relating to registered, and unregistered trademarks. Undoubtedly, the present case deals with a trademark the usage of trademark by the appellant, which according to the respondent plaintiff is an illegal usage. Thus, the subject matter of the dispute does relate to intellectual property rights. Hence, the dispute is a commercial dispute as defined by Section 2(1)(c)(xvii) of the Act. 9. The Karnataka Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act deals with the calculation of Court Fees. Section 26 of the said Act clearly states that in a suit for injunction, whether the subject-matter of the suit has a market value, or not, the fee shall be computed on the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint, or on rupees one thousand whichever is higher. Therefore, a distinction has to be made between the value of the subject-matter, and the calculation of Court fees. According to Section 26(c), the Court fee shall be based on the relief sought, and the value of the relief mentioned in the plaint. Admittedly, in the present case, in the plaint, the relief sought was valued as Rs.3,000/-. But nonetheless, the value of the subject-matter, that is the infringement of the trademark, has not been stated. But considering the fact that the dispute relates to the infringement of trademark that too by a company, the value of the subject matter can safely be taken to be more than Rs.3,00,000/-.”",

In my view, literally interpreting Section 16, the interpretation that follows is that the amendments introduced by Section 16 apply only to Commercial Disputes of a Specified Value and not Commercial Disputes not of a Specified Value. This is the letter of  law. Section 16, as it reads currently ought to be interpreted literally. In Kanai Lal Sur vs. Paramnidhi Sadhukhan, it was held by the Apex Court that if the words used are capable of one construction only then it would not be open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical construction on the ground that such construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the subject Act. Further, the Apex Court, in its decision rendered in Commr. of Customs v. Dilip Kumar & Co.,34 has held thus:  \"21.The well-settled principle is that when the words in a statute are clear, plain and unambiguous and only one meaning can be inferred, the courts are bound to give effect to the said meaning irrespective of consequences.

The question had arisen in the context of a communication received from the ld. District & Sessions Judge, Mr. Dinesh Kumar (as he then was), relating to the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts. In the said letter, the concerned ld. District Judge had brought to the notice of the Committee, the confusion that had arisen in respect of transferring of IPR cases to Commercial Courts. The Committee, consisting of then Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.S. Endlaw and Hon’ble Mr. Justice Yogesh Khanna, considered the said communication and, in its minutes dated 4th February, 2020, directed as under:  “Considered and discussed. Section 134 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 states that no suit for the infringement or relating to any right in a registered trademark or for passing of regarding any trademark “shall be instituted in any court inferior to a District Court having jurisdiction to try the suit.” The words “inferior to a District Court” have been interpreted and held to mean the court of a District Judge and not the Court of the Senior Civil Judge or the Civil Judge. Therefore, matters pertaining to trademark in which the relief even if valued less than Rs.3,00,000/-can be entertained only by the courts of District Judge/Additional District Judge at the District Court level.  The question whether a suit within the meaning of Section 134 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 can at all be permitted to be valued at less than Rs.3,00,000/-which court fees paid on valuation below Rs.3,00,000/-is maintainable or not may be left to be decided on the judicial side by the court of the District Judge  As regards the previous notification of this Court nominating all courts of District Judge/Additional District Judge as Commercial Courts, in view of establishment of dedicated courts of District Judge (Commercial Court), the Committee recommends that the order No. 58/DHC/Gaz/G-1/VI.E2(a)/2018 dated 7.7.2018 vide which all the District Judge/Additional District judges were designated as Commercial Courts be withdrawn with immediate effect.”",

The legal position as to suit valuation, choice of forum, payment of Court fee, etc., both before and after the enactment of the CCA, as emerging from various judicial decisions, is summarized below:  (i)   To decide the valuation and Court fee payable in a case, the Court should look into the allegations in the plaint and examine the substantive reliefs. Mere astuteness in drafting the plaint will not be allowed to stand in the way of the Court to look into the substance of the relief sought. Whimsical valuation is thus not permitted.  (ii)  Valuation of a suit has to be adequate and reasonable. The plaintiff cannot deliberately/arbitrarily undervalue the relief. There must be a genuine effort by the plaintiff to estimate the relief. [Meenakshisundaram Chettiar v. Venkatachalam Chettiar, (1980) 1 SCC 616];  (iii)  If the valuation given by the plaintiff is arbitrary and  unreasonable, the Court may reject the same and permit the plaintiff to correct the valuation or have the plaint rejected. The valuation must not be arbitrary or manifestly inadequate. [Abdul Hamid Shamsi v.  (iv)   The plaintiff cannot whimsically choose a ridiculous figure for filing the suit in an arbitrary manner where there are positive materials or objective standards of valuation of the relief, on the face of the plaint. [Commercial Aviation & Travel Company v. Vimani Pannalal, (1988) SCC 423]  (v)   The plaintiff has to give definite reasons for not ascertaining the exact value of the relief. If the exact valuation is not done, on the basis of certain basic requirements, the plaintiff’s discretion would become arbitrary. Lack of bonafides would also cloud the right of the plaintiff to value the suit as per its own will. The Court can then compel the plaintiff to examine the plaint and would require the plaintiff to pay the requisite ad valorem Court fee. [Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. v. All India Bharat Sanchar Nigam Executives’ Association (Regd.) & Ors. (2006) 130 DLT 195]  (vi)   The plaintiff being the dominus litis, can choose its forum. However, this prerogative or convenience for the plaintiff cannot eclipse the requirement of justice. The right to choose the forum is not an absolute one and can be taken away. [Subhashini Malik v. S.K.  (vii)   A court of a higher grade does not lack inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute which could have been entertained by a lower court, whereas the same would not hold good in the reverse situation.  (viii)   There are three categories of jurisdiction: (i)Territorial jurisdiction; (ii)Pecuniary jurisdiction; and (iii)Subject matter jurisdiction. It is only if the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, that it would lack inherent jurisdiction. [Harshad Chiman Lal Modi  v. D.L.F. Universal Ltd. And Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 791 and Mantoo Sarkar v Oriental Insurance Company Limited & Ors., (2009) 2 SCC 244]  (ix)  The intention of the underlying statutes has to be considered and given effect to, unless it leads to an absurdity. The construction of a statute ought to be such as to advance the intention of the legislation and remedy any mischief. [Glaxo Laboratories v. Presiding Officer, AIR 1984 SC 505]  (x) When there are multiple suits which could govern any subject matter, the endeavour of the Court ought to be to apply a harmonious construction to the said provisions, especially when there is no repugnancy or inconsistency.

Whenever reliefs are sought of damages or rendition of accounts, the suit is valued on a monetary basis by the plaintiff using a rough estimate and Court fee is paid on the said basis. It is very unlikely that the valuation in suits where one of the reliefs sought is for damages and/or rendition of accounts, is less than Rs.3 lakhs. However, even in some cases where damages or rendition of accounts is sought, the ingenuity of lawyers and litigants does lead to suits being valued at less than Rs.3 lakhs. In such cases, the relief of injunction is also valued at Rs.200/-or any other amount less than Rs.3 lakhs and minimal Court fee is paid, despite the intellectual property -which is the subject matter of the suit -being of a very high value.",

The turnover of the Plaintiff as pleaded in the suit and as per the CA Certificate placed on record dated 5th August, 2021, is approximately Rs.67306 lakhs over the last three financial years, i.e., 2018-2021. Moreover, the Plaintiff has stated in its plaint that it has “commanded handsome sales running into Billions of Rupees”. It is also stated to have spent “enormous amounts of money” in advertising and publicity. The said mark, including the label, is stated to have extensive goodwill and reputation, having been adopted in 1988, with copyright and trademark  registrations dating back to 2006. The Plaintiff has stated that it has reputed clients such as Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam, NTPC, BSNL, MTNL, L&T, etc., across India and worldwide. The Plaintiff is also stated to have extensive reach and online presence through both its website and third-party sites like IndiaMART, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. The Plaintiff also has numerous quality certifications and recognitions, including ISO, BIS, and One Star Export House (recognized by the Director General of Foreign Trade). Despite all these facts, it is puzzling that the reliefs of injunction as also delivery-up, are valued at Rs. 200/-each for Court fee and jurisdiction, which is much below Rs.3 lakhs. The Court fee paid is Rs.100/-for such reliefs. Additionally, the relief of rendition of accounts is valued at Rs. 1000/-and Court fees of Rs. 150/-is paid for the same. Such a course of action appears to be quite unusual and quixotic, as there is no basis in the suit as to why a trademark suit of a brand having such a huge turnover is sought to be valued at such a low threshold. Moreover, the suit in the present case does not mention the ‘specified value’ at all, but merely the value of reliefs sought.",

                        "content": "To answer the above, first, the discussion in paragraph 25 above is pertinent, as it clearly shows that IPR disputes are a set of disputes which lie only before the District Court. Thus, in that sense, such disputes are an exception to the rule of institution of cases at the Court of the lowest level having jurisdiction. With the enactment of the CCA, the subject-matter jurisdiction over IPR disputes now vests with the Commercial Courts, at the District Court Level. Therefore, can litigants and lawyers escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA by valuing the suits below Rs.3 lakhs? The answer ought to be a clear ‘NO’. This is due to the following reasons:  (i)  The application of the judicial principles that the plaintiff is dominus litis and is free to value the suit in the manner it so chooses, has to be in the context of enactment of the CCA. The principles cannot be stretched to justify undervaluation of IPR disputes and payment of lower Court fee.  (ii)  Not ascribing a ‘specified value’ in the suit would be contrary to the scheme of the CCA which requires every suit to have a ‘specified value’, if the subject matter of the suit is a ‘commercial dispute’. A perusal of Section 12(1)(d) of the CCA does offer some guidance, that the ‘specified value’ in case of intangible rights would be the market value of the said rights as estimated by the plaintiff.  (iii)  In IPR disputes, the relief of injunction or damages may be  valued by the plaintiff, at an amount lower than the sum of Rs.3 lakhs and Court fee may be paid on that basis. If such valuation is permitted, despite some objective criteria being available for valuing IPR -in the CCA -it would defeat the very purpose of the enactment of special provisions for IPR statutes and the CCA. These statutes would have to be harmoniously construed i.e., in a manner so as to further the purpose of the legislation and not to defeat it. Thus, it would be mandatory for IPR suits to be ascribed a ‘specified value’, in the absence of which the valuation of the suit below Rs.3 lakhs would be arbitrary, whimsical and wholly unreasonable. In this view, intellectual property rights being intangible rights, some value would have to be given to the subject matter of the dispute as well. The Court would have to take into consideration the ‘specified value’ based upon not merely the value of the relief sought but also the market value of the intangible right involved in the said dispute.  (iv)  The subject matter of IPR disputes is usually trademarks, rights in copyrightable works, patents, designs and such other intangible property. The said amount of Rs.3 lakhs is the estimation of the legislature as being the lowest threshold in any ‘commercial dispute’ in India which deserves to benefit from speedier adjudication, owing to the economic progress in the country. The intention of the Legislature in keeping a lower threshold in a ‘commercial dispute’ of Rs.3 lakhs cannot be rendered meaningless. It would only be in exceptional cases that valuation of IPR disputes below Rs.3 lakhs could be justified. Accordingly, Section 12(1)(d) has been included in the CCA, where the subject matter of “intellectual property” has been  contemplated by the Legislature to be an intangible right, in respect of which the market value has to be estimated by the plaintiff, for determining the ‘specified value’.  (v)  The average Court fee paid in Delhi in any civil suit is approximately 3% to 1% of the pecuniary value ascribed to the suit. In fact, Delhi is one of the territories where ad valorem Court fee is paid beyond a particular threshold. When seen from this perspective, i.e., that at Rs.3 lakhs, the Court fee payable is minimal, it is apparent that the only reason for which IPR disputes may be valued below Rs.3 lakhs by litigants or lawyers would be to indulge in forum shopping and bench hunting and not merely to exercise the option of the forum where relief is sought. The purpose would also be to escape the rigors of the provisions of the CCA. Such a practice would constitute abuse by plaintiffs of their rights, at the very least.  (vi)  Usually, IPR disputes are filed by business entities. However, considering the Court fee payable even if such suits are valued at a minimum of Rs.3,00,000/-, even individual IPR owners would be easily able to afford the Court fee at the rate of 1-3%. There thus appears to be no valid or justifiable cause to value an IPR suit below Rs.3 lakhs except for oblique motives. Thus, the discretion vested in the plaintiff to value the suit as it pleases, ought not to be extended or stretched to an extent that it encourages malpractice, misuse, abuse and forum shopping.",

However, acknowledging the plaintiff’s reasonable discretion in valuing its suit, it is held that in case a plaintiff values an IPR suit below the threshold of Rs.3 lakhs, such suits would be listed before the District Judge (Commercial) first, in order to determine as to whether the valuation is arbitrarily whimsical or deliberately undervalued.",

All IPR suits to be instituted before District Courts, would therefore, first be instituted before the District Judge (Commercial).  (ii)  In case of any IPR suits valued below Rs. 3 lakhs, the Commercial Court shall examine the specified value and suit valuation to ensure it is not arbitrary or unreasonable and the suit is  not undervalued.  (iii)  Upon such examination, the concerned Commercial Court would pass appropriate orders in accordance with law either directing the plaintiff to amend the plaint and pay the requisite Court fee or to proceed with the suit as a non-commercial suit.  (iv)  In order to however maintain consistency and clarity in adjudication, even such suits which may be valued below Rs.3 lakhs and continue as non-commercial suits, shall also continue to be listed before the District Judge (Commercial), but may not be subjected to the provisions of the CCA.  (v)  All pending IPR suits before the different District Judges (non-Commercial) in Delhi shall be placed before the concerned District Judges (Commercial) for following the procedure specified above. plaintiffs who wish to amend the Plaint would be permitted to do so in accordance with law.",
