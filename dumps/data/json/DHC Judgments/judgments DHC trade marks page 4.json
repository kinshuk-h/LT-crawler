In fact, in para 4 of the impugned order, the Trial Court has noted the argument with respect to the claim of the Appellants in the original ‘artistic work’ and in para 7, it is stated that the Appellants in the suit seek permanent injunction premised on passing off and infringement under Section 51 of the Copyright Act, 1957. Despite this, the Trial Court has not even dealt with and addressed the two vital issues, which would have had a significant  bearing on continuation or vacation of the ex-parte ad interim injunction order.",

Predicating its decision on these two factors, vide the impugned order, the Trial Court erroneously vacated the interim injunction qua the Respondent’s product ‘footwear’ under the impugned trademark VINTEX.

Therefore, an infringement action would lie even when the goods are dissimilar as clearly contemplated in Section 29(4) of the Act. Appellants had raised a plea under Section 29(4) of the Act and argued that the Respondent can be injuncted even in respect of totally different goods as the Appellants have huge reputation and goodwill  in their trademark for which necessary details were furnished in the plaint. The argument is noted by the Trial Court in para 10 of the impugned order and yet in the entire order, there is no discussion on the said issues.

In the said case, based on material on record which included the search results, it was evident that the mark ‘CANON’ was adopted by several entities other than the Plaintiff and even prior to the registration of the Plaintiff. Another factor that weighed with the Court to come to a conclusion against the Plaintiff therein was that the Defendants therein had been using the mark for the past many years and had been participating in various exhibitions and openly using CANON as a part of their trading name and style as also the fact that despite registration of the mark CANON in respect of goods in Class 6, Plaintiff it had not used the said mark on any goods falling in the said Class.

Appellants are right in urging that the Trial Court has not even dealt with these issues and this, in my view, has caused prejudice to the Appellants inasmuch as the ex parte ad interim injunction granted initially in their favour stood partially vacated by the impugned order.

The Trial Court has rejected the claim of infringement set up by the Appellants, qua the footwears of the Respondent primarily on the ground that the goods are dissimilar and in different classes and has totally overlooked the plea under Section 29(4) of the Act. Had the Trial Court taken into consideration this argument of the Appellants, the claim of infringement qua the footwears may have sustained in favour of the Appellants. Trial Court has also completely overlooked the arguments made by the Appellants with respect to copyright infringement and passing off. It is a settled law that infringement is a statutory right while passing off is a common law right and while the former may fail, Plaintiff may succeed in proving the latter. Appellants had set out a case of passing off based on similarity of trademarks, reputation and goodwill etc. and ought to have been dealt with by the Trial Court. However, the order reflects that no finding has been returned qua the relief of passing off. The mandate of Section 27(2) of the Act is clear that relief of passing off is uninfluenced and independent of the other provisions of the Act. It is also settled that common field of activity is not conclusive for deciding a claim based on passing off, as the real question is whether as a result of misrepresentation there is a likelihood of confusion and deception amongst the public that the goods of the Defendant emanate from the Plaintiff, resulting in consequential injury to the Plaintiff and is based on the principle that no entity or person can be permitted to sell its goods as that of the other.",

Dinakaran Nair & Ors., 2006 SCC OnLine Del 459 has held as under:- “13. The only other question to be examined is the claim of damages of Rs. 20 lakh made in para 48(iii) (repeated) of the plaint. In this behalf, learned Counsel has relied upon the judgments of this Court in Relaxo Rubber Limited v. Selection Footwear, 1999 PTC (19) 578; Hindustan Machines v. Royal Electrical Appliances, 1999 PTC (19) 685; and CS (OS) 2711/1999, L.T. Overseas Ltd. v. Guruji Trading Co., 123 (2005) DLT 503 decided on 7.9.2003. In all these cases, damages of Rs. 3 lakh were awarded in favour of the plaintiff. In Time Incorporated v. Lokesh Srivastava, 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del) apart from compensatory damages even punitive damages were awarded to discourage and dishearten law breakers who indulge in violation with impunity. In a recent judgment in Hero Honda Motors Ltd. v. Shree Assuramji Scooters, 125 (2005) DLT 504 this Court has taken the view that damages in such a case should be awarded against defendants who chose to stay away from proceedings of the Court and they should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of evasion of Court proceedings. The rationale for the same is that while defendants who appear in Court may be burdened with damages while defendants who chose to stay away from the Court would escape such damages. The actions of the defendants result in affecting the reputation of the plaintiff and every endeavour should be made for a larger public purpose to discourage such parties from indulging in acts of deception.",

The relevant extract of the impugned order reads as under:- •So, when we compare the trade mark of the plaintiff LETROZ and that of the defendant LETERO, it is clear that there is no deceptive similarity which can confuse the doctor or the chemist. Admittedly, there is huge difference in the prices of the medicines. The composition are totally similar as reflected clearly on the boxes. However, the maximum retail price over the medicine of the plaintiff is reflected as Rs.187.80/-, whereas the medicine of the defendant, costs Rs.60/-which is more than thrice of the defendant. Meaning thereby, the plaintiff intends to get enrichment at the cost of general public. The pronunciation of the trade mark i.e. LETERO and that of LETROZ is totally different. The names of both are also different.  It is beyond understanding as to how the plaintiff can stop the defendant from using Ist two alphabets when he himself is using all the 6 alphabets LETERO of the generic name i.e LETEROZOLE.  Hence, on the basis of the pleadings and also the documents placed on record by the parties, no prima-facie case is made out in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. The balance of convenience also does not lie in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. Hence, the application is dismissed.•",

Alkem Laboratories Ltd.:  2009  SCC OnLine Del 3886, a Coordinate Bench of this Court upheld the order passed by the learned Single Judge declining to grant an injunction to the plaintiff, who had filed a suit for infringement of its marks •TEMODAL• and •TEMODAR•, in relation to its pharmaceutical products containing •TEMOZOLOMIDE• as the API. The drug in question is used for the treatment of brain cancer. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant•s marks, •TEMOKEM• and •TEMOGET• were deceptively similar to its trademarks and therefore, the defendant was required to be interdicted from using the said trademarks. The said contention was not accepted. It was held that the marks were not identical and there was no phonetic or visual similarity between them. The trademarks were derived from the drug •TEMOZOLOMIDE• and the suffix, •KEM• and •GET•, are entirely different and distinct from the suffix •DAL• and •DAR•. Both were Schedule H drugs and could be sold in retail but only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. The Court observed the fact that the product in question is a highly specialized drug and used for specific treatment of brain cancer was an important factor in considering whether the trademarks are deceptively similar and can cause confusion. The Court also took note of the fact that there was an immense price difference between the products of the appellant and that of the respondents.",

The relevant extract from the said decision is set out below:  •108. These may be some of the grounds for the appellants to fail in their action against the respondents, but these are not the only grounds why the Court would deny interim relief of injunction in cases like these. For the appellants to succeed, they must also establish that the respondents have no right to use the generic name/abbreviation of the compound •TEMOZOLOMIDE• in their drugs, and that the appellants have an exclusive right in this regard. This, unfortunately for the appellants, they have failed to show. In our view, for the appellants to fail it is enough that the appellants' trademark have been coined by combining the publici juris abbreviation TEM/TEMO for TEMOZOLOMIDE with the suffix •DAL• in one case and •DAR• in the other case, the marks of the appellants are descriptive, and the marks of the respondents do not bear phonetic or visual similarity which could be said to be deceptive or confusing for the purchasers of the drugs in question.",

An appeal against exercise of discretion is said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not reassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the court below if the one reached by that court was reasonably possible on the material.

The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles Fifth Edition 2002, Vol. 1. defines the term “Allied” as “connected by nature or qualities; having affinity” and the term “Cognate” as “akin in origin, nature or quality”. Reference may also be made to New Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus of the English Language, 1992 which defines “Allied” as “relating in subject or kind” and “Cognate” as “1. adj. having a common ancestor or origin (of languages or words) having a common source or root (of subjects etc.) related, naturally grouped  together.”. Cognate goods/services can be described, inter alia, as goods or services which have a trade connection -as in glucose and biscuits (See Corn Products Refining Co. v. Shangrila Food Products Ltd., AIR 1960 SC 142) or which are intended for the same class of customers -as in television picture tubes (parts thereof, video tapes and cassettes and television tuners etc.) and televisions, tuners and T.V.

Only the marks are to be compared by the Court and in case the registration is granted in favour of the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason of the said registration.” It was further held that “the test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound one since a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before him when he makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are remembered by general impression or by some significant detail rather than by any photographic recollection of the whole. While judging the question as to whether the defendant has  infringed the trade mark by colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public and not by merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.”",

As held by the Supreme Court in Laxmikant Patel (supra), a refusal to grant an injunction in spite of the availability of facts, which are prima facie established by overwhelming evidence and material available on record justifying the grant thereof, occasions a failure of justice and such injury to the plaintiff as would not be capable of being undone at a later stage; it, therefore, becomes obligatory on the part of the Appellate Court to interfere.",

In the present case, as the goods were admittedly being imported from China, the design of the product was being disclosed to various individuals who handled the import of consignment of these products and, therefore, the design was prior published as on the date of its registration.",

This court is also of the opinion that the Full Bench ruling in Mohan Lal (supra) made an observation, which is inaccurate: it firstly correctly noted that registration as a design is not possible, of a trade mark; it, however later noted that “post registration under Section 11 of the Designs Act, there can be no limitation on its use as a trademark by the registrant of the design.  The reason being: the use of a registered design as a trade mark, is not provided as a ground for its cancellation under Section 19 of the Designs Act.” This observation ignores that the Designs Act, Section 19(e) specifically exposes a  registered design to cancellation when “(e) it is not a design as defined under clause (d) of section 2.” The reason for this is that Section 2 of the Designs Act, defines “design” as “.... the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article......; but does not include any trade mark as defined in clause (v) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958...... ” Therefore, if the registered design per se is used as a trade mark, it apparently can be cancelled. The larger legal formulation in Mohan Lal (supra), that a passing off action i.e. one which is not limited or restricted to trademark use alone, but the overall get up or “trade dress” however, is correct; as long as the elements of the design are not used as a trademark, but a larger trade dress get up, presentation of the product through its packaging and so on, given that a “passing off” claim can include but is also broader than infringement of a trademark, the cause of action against such use lies.”  (Emphasis supplied in Bold)",

The only stray document relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner in this regard is the NOC issued by the DCGI on 23.07.2001. The said document does not bear any reference to a trade mark . The learned counsel claims that the said NOC was granted on an application filed by M/s Swiss Pharma Pvt. Ltd., which in turn depicts the mark •VEGA-100•. However, the connection between the two documents cannot be established. Even otherwise, as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, these documents do not show the user of the mark on the actual product. The judgment in M/s Kisan Industries (supra), therefore, cannot come to the aid of the petitioner, as in the present case, there is neither an assignment of the mark by M/s Ma Gayatri in favour of the petitioner, nor the prior use of the mark •VEGA• by M/s Ma Gayatri has been established by the petitioner. In fact, the judgment of Pioneer Nuts and Bolts Pvt. Ltd. (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner, works against the petitioner itself, as  the petitioner has not placed any credible evidence of proof of the use of the mark by M/s Ma Gayatri.",

This is a finding of fact by the learned IPAB. In exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, such finding of fact cannot be interfered with by a court by re-appreciating evidence and coming to its own conclusion. The jurisdiction of this Court can be exercised only where such findings are found to be completely perverse or un-substantiated by any evidence on record. This Court does not sit as a Court of Appeal against the order of learned IPAB, so as to re-appreciate the evidence on merit. In this regard, reference can be made to the judgement passed by this Court in U.V.  Enterprises v. New Bharat Rice Mills, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 3645, wherein it was observed that:  \"12... One may only remind oneself that the court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, is not acting as an appellate court and, therefore, findings of fact reached by tribunals, as a result of appreciation of evidence cannot be re-opened or questioned in writ proceedings unless it is a case of no evidence or a case where a tribunal has erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence or, has erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence which, propelled it to come to the impugned finding. Apart from these errors, findings of fact arrived at by an inferior court or tribunal cannot be reopened. The other exceptions where the superior courts exercising writ jurisdiction can interfere are cases  where principles of natural justice are breached or a subordinate Court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or exercises jurisdiction with material irregularity. Therefore, it is often said that a writ court is concerned with the decision making process and not the decision itself.\"",
