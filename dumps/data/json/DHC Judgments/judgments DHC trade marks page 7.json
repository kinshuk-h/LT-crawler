The relevant paragraphs are extracted hereafter:  “25. The learned counsel for the respondent then contended that though the principal prayer in the writ petition is for quashing the letters of repudiation by the first respondent, in fact the writ petition is one for a “money claim” which cannot be granted in a writ petition under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1712542/>)Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In our opinion, this argument of the learned counsel also cannot be accepted in its absolute terms. This Court in the case of (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1703868/>)(<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1703868/>)U.P. (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1703868/>)Pollution Control Board & Ors. vs. Kanoria Industrial Ltd. & Anr. [2001 (2) SCC 549] while dealing with the question of refund of money in a writ petition after discussing the earlier case law on this subject held :  \"12. In the para extracted above, in a similar situation as arising in the present cases relating to the very question of refund, while answering the said question affirmatively, this Court pointed out that the courts have made distinction between those cases where a claimant approached a High Court seeking relief of obtaining refund only and those where refund was sought as a consequential relief after striking down of the order of assessment, etc. In these cases also the claims made for refund in the writ petitions were consequent upon declaration of law made by this Court. Hence, the High Court committed no error in entertaining the writ petitions. * * *",

[AIR 1965 SC 1740] was cited. In AIR para 6 of the said judgment, it is stated that - „we are of the opinion that though the High Courts have power to pass any appropriate order in the exercise of the powers conferred under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1712542/>)Article 226 of the Constitution, such a petition solely praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State to refund the money is not ordinarily maintainable for the simple reason that a claim for such a refund can always be made in a suit against the authority which had illegally collected the money as a tax‟.",

                        "content": "Again in AIR para 9, the Court held:  „We, therefore, hold that normally petitions solely praying for the refund of money against the State by a writ of mandamus are not to be entertained. The aggrieved party has the right of going to the civil court for claiming the amount and it is open to the State to raise all possible defences to the claim, defences which cannot, in most cases, be appropriately raised and considered in the exercise of writ jurisdiction.‟  This judgment cannot be read as laying down the law that no writ petition at all can be entertained where claim is made for only refund of money consequent upon declaration of law that levy and collection of tax/cess as unconstitutional or without the authority of law. It is one thing to say that the High Court has no power under (<https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1712542/>)Article 226 of the Constitution to issue a writ of mandamus for making refund of the money illegally collected. It is yet another thing to say that such power can be exercised sparingly depending on facts and circumstances of each case. For instance, in the cases on hand where facts are not in dispute, collection of money as cess was itself without the authority of law; no case of undue enrichment was made out and the amount of cess was paid under protest; the writ petitions were filed within a reasonable time from the date of the declaration that the law under which tax/cess was collected was unconstitutional. There is no good reason to deny a relief of refund to the citizens in such cases on the principles of public interest and equity in the light of the cases cited above. However, it must not be understood that in all cases where collection of cess, levy or tax is held to be unconstitutional or invalid, the refund should necessarily follow. We wish to add that even in cases where collection of cess, levy or tax is held to be unconstitutional or invalid, refund is not an automatic  consequence but may be refused on several grounds depending on facts and circumstances of a given case.\"",

                        "content": "A quia timet action cannot, however, be predicated on hypothetical or imaginary infringements. In my considered opinion, it is not permissible for the Court to hold, in advance, that every prospective alternative domain name, containing the word/thread/string “SNAPDEAL” would necessarily be infringing in nature and, thereby, injunct, in an omnibus and global fashion, DNRs from ever providing any domain name containing “SNAPDEAL”. This, in my view, would be completely impermissible. Section 28(1) of the Trade Marks Act provides the proprietor of a registered trade mark the right to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the registered trade mark. “Infringement of registered trade marks” is, in turn, defined in Section 29. Infringement, in each sub-section of Section 29, is envisaged by use of “a mark” which infringes the registered trade mark of another, and sets out the various situations in which such infringement could be said to have taken place. The allegedly infringing mark must, however, be clear and identifiable. If it is, by combined operation of Section 28(1) and Section 29, the proprietor of the allegedly infringed registered trade mark would be entitled to an injunction against the use of the allegedly infringing mark. The plaintiff has to draw the attention of the Court to the marks, of the defendant, which  infringe the plaintiff’s registered trade mark. In the present case, the plaintiff has necessarily to come to the Court – as it has been doing in the past – against every domain name which it perceives to be infringing of its registered “SNAPDEAL” marks. The Court would then have to examine whether such mark is, in fact, infringing and, if so, injunct the use of such mark/domain names. The cause of action, in any trademark infringement suit, has to be with respect to the particular infringing trademark/trademarks. The Court cannot pass an order, to operate in futuro, restricting the defendants from offering, for registration, any domain name, which includes the thread “SNAPDEAL”, as that would be attributing, to the Court, a clairvoyance which it does not possess.",

A situation in which the algorithms of the DNRs make available, to prospective registrants, infringing domain names, leaving the proprietors of the infringed trade marks to repeatedly knock at the doors of the Court cannot be allowed to continue in perpetuo.",

This Court in Levi Strauss and Co. v.

Under the law of trade marks, the definition of ‘mark’ has evolved over time. Traditionally, trademarks included names, words, devices, logo, label/packaging, letters, numerals etc. However, this list of trademarks has expanded over the years to include colour, combination of colours, shape of goods, patterns of products, smell, and sound marks etc. These broad two categories of marks are loosely referred to as –  •  Traditional Trademarks  •  Non-Traditional Trademarks.",

The question in such a case would be as to whether mere appearance of the said stitching pattern would perform a trademark function i.e., associate the jeans with the Plaintiff. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative then the pattern would be construed as a trademark deserving protection. There may be a large number of stitching patterns which may be merely for aesthetic or visual appeal. However, when a trademark owner’s stitching pattern per se identifies the jeans, even without a name or a logo, then the intention of the proprietor is for the pattern to perform the function of a trademark. In such a case, the Court would have to examine as to whether the stitching pattern has an ‘acquired meaning’, or is distinctive per se. The test of acquired meaning is similar to the test of secondary meaning applied to descriptive words. In McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition [4th Ed., Vol.1,], J. Thomas McCarthy while dealing with geometric shapes as trademark formats opines as under:  However, uncommon or unusual shapes and symbols that contain some minimum amount of inventiveness or fancifulness can be regarded as inherently distinctive and protected as such,  without the need for proof of secondary meaning. The issue is whether this shape is so unusual for this type of goods or services that its distinctiveness can be assumed.”",

                        "content": "The Supreme Court of the United Stated in the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers 529 U.S. 205, 120 S.Ct. 1339 was considering an action for infringement of an unregistered product design under the Lanham Act. The Court held that for exclusivity to be granted in design of a product, the Plaintiff must ‘always’ prove that the design has acquired secondary meaning in the market place and it could never be classified as inherently distinctive. The key passages in the judgment of the  Court merit citation in full:  “It seems to us that design, like color, is not inherently distinctive. The attribution of inherent distinctiveness to certain categories of word marks and product packaging derives from the fact that the very purpose of attaching a particular word to a product, or encasing it in a distinctive packaging, is most often to identify the source of the product. Although the words and packaging can serve subsidiary functions— a suggestive word mark (such as “Tide” for laundry detergent), for instance, may invoke positive connotations in the consumer’s mind, and a garish form of packaging (such as Tide’s squat, brightly decorated plastic bottles for its liquid laundry detergent) may attract an otherwise indifferent consumer’s attention on a crowded store shelf— their predominant function remains source identification. Consumers are therefore predisposed to regard those symbols as indication of the producer, which is why such symbols “almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand,” id., at 162-163, and “immediately… signal a brand or a product ‘source,’” id., at 163. And where it is not reasonable to assume consumer predisposition to take an affixed word or packaging as indication of source— where, for example, the affixed word is descriptive of the product (“Tasty” bread) or of a geographic origin (“Georgia” peaches)— inherent distinctiveness will not be found. That is why the statute generally excludes, from those word marks that can be registered as inherently distinctive, words that are “merely descriptive” of the goods, §2(e)(1), 15 U. S. C. §1052(e)(1), or “primarily geographically descriptive of them,” see §2(e)(2), 15 U. S. C. §1052(e)(2). In the case of product design, as in the case of color, we think consumer predisposition to equate the feature with the source does not exist. Consumers are aware of the reality that, almost invariably, even the most unusual of product  designs— such as a cocktail shaker shaped like a penguin— is intended not to identify the source, but to render the product itself more useful or more appealing.  The fact that product design almost invariably serves purposes other than source identification not only renders inherent distinctiveness problematic; it also renders application of an inherent-distinctiveness principle more harmful to other consumer interests. Consumers should not be deprived of the benefits of competition with regard to the utilitarian and esthetic purposes that product design ordinarily serves by a rule of law that facilitates plausible threats of suit against new entrants based upon alleged inherent distinctiveness. How easy it is to mount a plausible suit depends, of course, upon the clarity of the test for inherent distinctiveness, and where product design is concerned we have little confidence that a reasonably clear test can be devised. Respondent and the United States as amicus curiae urge us to adopt for product design relevant portions of the test formulated by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals for product packaging in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods, Ltd., 568 F. 2d 1342 (1977). That opinion, in determining the inherent distinctiveness of a product’s packaging, considered, among other things, “whether it was a ‘common’ basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field, [and] whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as a dress or ornamentation for the goods.” Id., at 1344 (footnotes omitted). Such a test would rarely provide the basis for summary disposition of an anticompetitive strike suit. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for the United States quite understandably would not give a definitive answer as to whether the test was met in this very case,  saying only that “[t]his is a very difficult case for that purpose.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.”",

There are three other points I should mention at this stage. First, and while it is true to say that the criteria for assessing the distinctive character of all kinds of marks are the same, the CJEU has recognised that the relevant public’s perception is not necessarily the same in the case of a three-dimensional mark consisting of the shape of a product or its packaging as it is in the case of, for example, a word or figurative mark consisting of a sign which is independent from the appearance of the products it denotes. Specifically, average consumers are not in the habit of making assumptions about the origin of products on the basis of their shape or the shape of their packaging in the absence of any graphic or word element, and it may therefore prove more difficult to establish distinctiveness in relation to such a three-dimensional mark than in relation to a word or figurative mark:  see, for example, Case C-136/02P Mag Instrument v OHIM [2004] ECR I-9165 at [30].",

Nevertheless, it must also be recognised that the degree of attention of the average consumer may vary from time to time, and that, at least in some cases, it is when making a choice between different products in the category concerned that the average consumer pays the highest degree of attention: see, for example, case C-24/05P August Storck KG v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market [2006] ECR I-5677 at [70] to [72].”",

Respondent No. 2 filed patent application No.284/MUM/2014 for ‘A synergistic suspo-emulsion formulation of Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron’ on 27.01.2014. Patent application was published under Section 11A of the Patents Act, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’) on 11.09.2015. Respondent No. 1 issued First Examination Report on 31.05.2018, objecting to the claims inter alia on grounds of lack of novelty, inventive step etc. Reply was filed by Respondent No. 2 on 19.07.2018 to the said Examination Report and subsequently, Respondent No. 2 amended the claims. On 04.03.2021, Petitioner filed a pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1) of the Act, opposing the grant of patent on several grounds including lack of novelty under Section 25(1)(b) and non-patentability under Section 25(1)(f) read with Section 3(d) and 3(e) of the Act as well as objecting to the scope of the amended claims.",

An inquiry envisaged under Section 3(d) is independent of an inquiry under Section 3(e). Section 3(d) deals with assessment of ‘enhanced efficacy’ of claimed composition in comparison to efficacy of known substance and not merely comparison of efficacy with individual components of the composition while Section 3(e), on the other hand, deals with assessment of synergistic effect of claimed composition over individual  properties of each component of the composition. Succinctly put, test for Section 3(d) is ‘enhanced efficacy’ while that for Section 3(e) is ‘synergistic effect’ and both operate in two different fields.",

Union of India and others, (2013) 6 SCC 1, wherein the importance of Section 3(d) as well as the scope of inquiry thereunder has been laid down. It was submitted that the Supreme Court in the said judgment has held that even if an invention satisfies the criteria of Novelty and Inventive step, patent can be denied on the ground of Section 3(d). Provisions of Section 3(d) exclude the patentability of a new form of a known substance if it does not result in enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance. Respondent No. 2 claimed a form (suspo-emulsion) of the admixture/combination of Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron and therefore, the applicant had to pass the test of both Section 3(d) and 3(e), though on different aspects, i.e., enhanced efficacy over known combination of a suspo-emulsion for the former and synergistic effect over the mere additive effect of individual components of the suspo-emulsion composition for the latter. Therefore, it is not right for the Respondents to take a stand that the reasoning given qua bio-efficacy and stability of the subject matter deals with both Section 3(d) and 3(e) and Respondent No. 1 was not separately required to consider the opposition under Section 3(d).",

Case of Petitioner was that Respondent No. 2’s claim to a SE composition containing a known combination of two agrochemical compounds with excipients is not patentable under Section 3(d). Petitioner admits that patent was sought in respect of a composition. A composition or an admixture falls entirely in the scope of examination under Section 3(e) and Section 3(d) would have no relevance in the present case. Reading of the provisions show that the moment the Petitioner refers to known substances being mixed together, the same automatically entails an examination under Section 3(e) and not under Section 3(d). Section 3(e) presupposes that the composition/admixture is of two or more known substances and therefore, what needs to be examined is whether the same exhibits a synergistic effect, which is not a mere aggregation of the properties or effects of two or more substances. Court would have to apply the ‘pith and substance’ test in respect of admixtures/ combinations and if so applied, only Section 3(e) is applicable.",

Succinctly put, the objection raised by the Respondents is that the issues raised by the Petitioner are impervious to jural interference in a writ jurisdiction and the objection is predicated on existence of an alternative efficacious remedy available to the Petitioner in terms of post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) of the Act as well as revocation petition under Section 64 thereof. Heavy reliance was placed on the judgments in Ucb Farchim (supra) and Mylan (supra). The argument is that pre-grant opposition is in the nature of an aid to examination and is not an adversarial proceeding and thus no right of the Petitioner can be said to be violated so as to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.",

                        "content": "Having considered the rival submissions on this aspect and given careful cogitation, in my view, the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents cannot be sustained. There cannot be a debate that the Act provides a remedy of post-grant opposition or a revocation petition to a ‘person interested’, who is unsuccessful in a pre-grant opposition as well as an appeal thereafter under Section 117A of the Act. Nonetheless, in my considered view, if the Petitioner is able to substantiate the pleas that Respondent No. 1 has committed a manifest error leading to violation of  principles of natural justice or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it or there is non-consideration of vital grounds or documents, Petitioner cannot be non-suited in the present petition. In order to come to this conclusion, this Court draws strength from the judicial expositions on the rule of alternative remedy and self-restraint. In Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others, (1998) 8 SCC 1, the Supreme Court has elaborately and perspicuously explained the scope and ambit of judicial interference in a writ jurisdiction even where an alternative remedy is available to a party. It was observed in the said case that under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, High Court has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition, but the High Court may impose upon itself certain restrictions, one of which is the existence of an effective and efficacious remedy available to a party, in which case the High Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. However, in three contingencies the alternative remedy does not operate as a bar and one of them, as enunciated by the Supreme Court, was where there is violation of principles of natural justice. Relevant paras of the judgment are as under:- “14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. This power can be exercised by the High Court not only for issuing writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution but also for “any other purpose”.",

The proposition is no doubt a binding dictum, however, in the present case, this Court is not reappreciating any finding of fact as an Appellate Authority and the judgment cannot help Respondent No.1. The contentions raised by the Petitioner are violation of principles of natural justice and non-consideration of grounds raised and documents filed and it is settled that these are the exceptions in which a writ jurisdiction can be exercised by a High Court. Similarly, in Sh. Satish Chand Kapoor (supra), this Court held that in a writ jurisdiction, the Court cannot act as an Appellate Court reappreciating the orders of the Tribunals or statutory authorities. Respondent No.1 has failed to note that in the same very judgment, the Court has held that the High Court may interfere in the final order passed by the statutory authority if the order suffers from manifest error and if allowed to stand, it would amount to  perpetuation of grave injustice.

In case Petitioner is able to establish the pleas raised, the impugned order becomes unsustainable in law, it would be unfair to relegate the Petitioner to the long-drawn remedy of a post-grant opposition under Section 25(2) or an application for revocation under Section 64 of the Act. In this context, I am persuaded by the observations of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Glochem Industries (supra), relevant paras of which are profitably reproduced as follows:- “11. The Respondent No. 1 on the other hand, have supported the impugned decision on the argument that all relevant matters have been taken into account by the Respondent No. 4 while answering the controversy on hand. It is not a case of any manifest error committed by the Respondent No. 4. Further, this Court cannot sit in appeal over the opinion of the Respondent No. 4 on technical issues. It is submitted that Petitioners had fair opportunity in pursuing their objections and the Respondent No. 4 has dealt with the objection as raised by the Petitioners and decided the same on merits. According to Respondent No. 1, there is an alternative and efficacious remedy available to the Petitioners to which they can take recourse to. It is submitted that the remedy of post grant opposition under Section 25(2) of the Act is still available. Even remedy of seeking suo moto revocation of Patent under Section 64 of the Act can be resorted to. Moreover, it is also open to the  Petitioners to file a counter claim for revocation or invalidation of Patent, in a suit which may be filed by the Patentee, under Section 104 of the Act.

Although the Petitioners may have remedy of post grant opposition or of seeking suo moto revocation as well as filing of a counter claim as is suggested by the Respondents that by itself can be no basis to non-suit the Petitioners, if the Petitioners were right in their grievance that the authority has committed manifest or jurisdictional error while considering the representation by way of opposition or for that matter decided the objections on palpable misreading and misapplication of the relevant provisions of law. This is so because the law provides for remedy of pre-grant opposition by virtue of Section 25(1) of the Act. If such a remedy is provided, the authority is obliged to consider the representation by way of pre-grant opposition under Section 25(1) keeping in mind the parameters of law by observing principles of natural justice. It is not necessary for us to examine the argument of the Petitioners that the remedy of pre-grant opposition is qualitatively different than the remedy of post-grant opposition. According to the Petitioners, in the pre-grant opposition, the onus is on the patent applicant to show that the alleged invention would result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance; whereas in the post-grant opposition, the onus will be on the objector to show that the alleged invention does not result in enhancement of the known efficacy of the stated substance. Suffice it to observe that the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent No. 1 does not mean that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the decision of the authority on the opposition under Section 25(1) of the Act. It is a matter of prudence and discretion as to whether the Court should entertain the writ petition or not.

The fact that an aggrieved party has an adequate remedy in law, which in a given case may persuade the Court not to intervene in the matter and relegate the party to the remedy available under the Statute, is a rule of policy, convenience and/or discretion rather than a rule of law. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in ABL International Ltd. and Anr. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and Ors., (2004) 3 SCC 553. Finding on the facts of the case that there were violations of principles of natural justice as well as the procedure adopted by Controller of Patents, the Court set aside the impugned order whereby grant of patent was rejected and remanded the matter for a fresh decision. In Agriboard International (supra) the Court found that without the required analysis in accordance with the provisions of the Act, rejection of the patent application was wrong as also that the impugned order was unreasoned and non-speaking and accordingly remanded the matter back to the Competent Authority for a fresh consideration, relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Manohar v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. AIR 2013 SC 681, wherein the Supreme Court has observed that application of mind and recording of reasons in a decision are the basic elements of natural justice and scrupulous adherence to these principles would be required while rejecting patent applications.

The claims of the impugned application relate to a suspo-emulsion formulation comprising a combination of known substances i.e., Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron with inactive excipients and therefore must fulfil the requirements of Section 3(d). The Opponent submits that claims of the impugned application relate to a suspo-emulsion formulation comprising a combination of known substances i.e., Pyriproxyfen and Diafenthiuron with inactive excipients. However, from the prior art documents cited herein, the formulation/ composition of the impugned application is already known. Moreover, the applicant has not provided any technical data and/or experimental proof of any enhancement in the significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy i.e., no experimental data has bene provided by the applicant to prove the alleged efficacious nature of the SE formulation/composition claimed by the applicant in the impugned application. The data provided in the specification of the impugned patent application only provides the average number of whiteflies after treatment with claimed formulation and the % leaf infection by Liriomyza Trifolii on Tomato Leaf miner, which does not indicate any enhancement of efficacy of the claimed formulation as no mortality rate has been provided by the applicant. Additionally, no comparison has been made by the applicant w.r.t the claimed formulation with any prior art SE formulation. Failing this, no efficacy can be claimed by the applicant in respect of the claimed formulation of the impugned application.  c)  Therefore, the Applicant’s claim to a SE composition containing a known combination of two agrochemical compounds with excipients is not patentable under Section 3(d) of The Patents Act.”",

Pithily put, the opposition was that given that the combination of Diafenthiuron and Pyriproxyfen was known in the prior art, i.e., D2, the applicant was required to show that the suspo-emulsion composition of Diafenthiuron and Pyriproxyfen is a new form of known combination of the two and that the new form resulted in enhancement of known efficacy of the existing combination, in order to cross the threshold test of Section 3(d).",

Relevant paras of the judgment are as follows:- “87. We are clearly of the view that the importance of the amendment made in Section 3(d), that is, the addition of the opening words in the substantive provision and the insertion of the Explanation to the substantive provision, cannot be underestimated. It is seen above that, in course of the Parliamentary debates, the amendment in Section 3(d) was the only provision cited by the Government to allay the fears of the Opposition members concerning the abuses to which a product patent in medicines may be vulnerable. We have, therefore, no doubt that the amendment/addition made in Section 3(d) is  meant especially to deal with chemical substances, and more particularly pharmaceutical products. The amended portion of Section 3(d) clearly sets up a second tier of qualifying standards for chemical substances/pharmaceutical products in order to leave the door open for true and genuine inventions but, at the same time, to check any attempt at repetitive patenting or extension of the patent term on spurious grounds.",

In that case, on reading clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) with Section 3(d) it would appear that the Act sets different standards for qualifying as “inventions” things belonging to different classes, and for medicines and drugs and other chemical substances, the Act sets the invention threshold further higher, by virtue of the amendments made in Section 3(d) in the year 2005.”  (emphasis supplied)",

                        "content": "Both Section 3(d) and 3(e) fall under Chapter II of the Act. Section 3(d) provides that a mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in enhanced efficacy of that substance shall not be an invention. Explanation to the Section provides that ‘combinations’ shall be considered to be the same substance unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy. Section 3(e) provides that a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of properties of the components thereof shall not be an invention. Plain reading of the two provisions, indicates that Section 3(d) entails an assessment of ‘enhanced  efficacy’ of the claimed composition in comparison to the efficacy of the known substance while the assessment under Section 3(e) is with a view to determine the synergistic effect of claimed composition with the individual properties of each component comprising the composition. Legislature in its wisdom has enacted two different provisions and the tests for both are different. The Supreme Court in Novartis (supra) has observed that Section 3(d) is not ex majore cautela and sets up a second tier of qualifying standards in chemical substances/pharmaceutical products to encourage genuine inventions, at the same time keeping check on evergreening. Section 3(d) provides a safeguard to patentability of a new form of known substance if it does not pass the threshold of enhanced efficacy. Thus, the Respondents may not be wholly correct in arguing that an adjudication under Section 3(e) of novelty or a product not being a mere admixture would cover the adjudication under Section 3(d). There is merit in the contention of the Petitioner that the patent applicant has claimed a suspo-emulsion of admixture/combination of Diafenthiuron and Pyriproxyfen and therefore, the applicant would have to pass the test under both Section 3(d) and 3(e), albeit on different aspects by showing enhanced efficacy over known combination of a suspo-emulsion qua Section 3(d) and synergistic effect over the mere additive effect of individual components of suspo-emulsion composition. Therefore, it was incumbent upon Respondent No. 1 to take note of the pre-grant opposition under Section 3(d) and deal with the same, in accordance with law and the material placed on record.",

However, if bio-efficacy/stability is to be tested in respect of Section 3(d), the test would be bio-efficacy/stability of the form, i.e., suspo-emulsion in this case and not the admixture, over and above the closest prior art brought forth by the opposer, which is the known substance as a comparator. Petitioner has also raised a plea that the data provided by Respondent No. 2 related to bio-efficacy/stability and not with respect to enhanced efficacy as compared to the prior art, i.e., the alleged known substance. Therefore, once the Petitioner had raised opposition under Section 3(d) and 3(e) both, Respondent No. 1 was required to deal with the opposition, looking at the scheme of the Act and the intent of the legislature in enacting two separate provisions.",

Had the objection been rejected on merit, Petitioner would have taken recourse to further remedies under the Act.

The increasing institution of cases in all Courts in India and its resultant burden upon the Courts has invited attention of all concerned in the justice administration system. Despite heavy quantum of cases in Courts, in our view, it would neither be permissible nor possible to state as a principle of law, that while exercising power of judicial review on administrative action and more particularly judgment of courts in appeal before the higher Court, providing of reasons can never be dispensed with. The doctrine of audi alteram partem has three basic essentials. Firstly, a person against whom an order is required to be passed or whose rights are likely to be affected adversely must be granted an opportunity of being heard. Secondly, the concerned authority should provide a fair and transparent procedure and lastly, the authority concerned must apply its mind and dispose of the matter by a reasoned or speaking order.

Union of India and Others, 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8590, relevant paras of which are as follows:- “56. The decision of the Controller, as recorded in the impugned order, has been set out hereinbefore. A plain reading of the said conclusion indicates that some of the issues raised by Mr. Jung had not been addressed. In addition, there is no  reference to the affidavits affirmed by Mr. Schafer and Dr. Charles L. Sawyers in the impugned order. It was contended that the said affidavits were regarding clinical trials and marketing approvals of the drug and, therefore, were not relevant. This Court finds the aforesaid contention to be unpersuasive. Admittedly, even a minor change in a compound used as a drug can bring in about significant changes in its therapeutic value. In this view, the affidavits affirmed by Mr. Schafer and Dr. Charles L. Sawyers could not be considered as irrelevant. However, even if it is accepted that the same were to be rejected as being irrelevant, the Controller was required to indicate the same. However, the impugned order is completely silent on the affidavits submitted by them. In view of the above, the impugned order is liable to be set aside also for the reason that the Controller had failed to consider the affidavits of the experts placed by the petitioner. xxx xxx xxx",
